    <gallery_image_caption><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;To create his "Amazonas" series, Felipe J&aacute;come asked women protesting oil drilling in the Ecuadorian Amazon why they are fighting to protect the jungle. They wrote their responses underneath their portraits. "They women of the Amazon fight for our land so our children can live free of contamination," reads a part of this woman's text. "We also fight so that the animals of the jungle can live freely. We fight because we think of the future."</p>]]></gallery_image_caption>

    <gallery_image_caption><![CDATA[&nbsp;"In 2002 an oil company came into Sarayacu territory to destroy the Amazon jungle. The women in this community worked side by side with our children, youth, adults and elders to resist...The women of Sarayacu have the dream of continuing to fight to preserve our territory, our jungle, our river and our air free of pollution. We also fight against violence against women in the community. Let's stand up. It's time to open our eyes. It's time to come together in one heart, pure and strong. It's time we rise again." ]]></gallery_image_caption>

    <gallery_image_caption><![CDATA["My name is Erlinda Manya. I marched so that the [oil companies] don't contaminate our land and our rivers. We reached Quito to ask our President to spare our land from the contamination created by oil companies, for the sake and well-being of our children. The first time that I marched to Quito was in 1991. My husband and I marched to ask the government to recognize our rights to our ancestral lands."<br />]]></gallery_image_caption>
