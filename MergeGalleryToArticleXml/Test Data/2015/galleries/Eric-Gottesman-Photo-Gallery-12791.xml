    <gallery_image_caption><![CDATA["The worst day of my life was the day my father died." Gottesman used a variety of methods in the project. In some images, like this one above by Bereket Muluneh, children were encouraged to reenact moments from their lives. Gottesman also changed camera formats throughout the project. Polaroid slowed the process down, while also providing instant gratification. ]]></gallery_image_caption>
