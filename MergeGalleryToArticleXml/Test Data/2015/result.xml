<strong><a href="http://www.nowherepeople.org/"><em>Nowhere People</em></a><br />
By Greg Constantine<br />
Foreword by Shirin Ebadi<br />
Nowhere People Books<br />
374 pages, images throughout<br />
$55</strong>
<p>“An entire generation of our children has grown up illiterate. Our children are going to grow up and curse us for the situation they are in.” These tragic lines appear in a block of text quoted in the endpapers of Greg Constantine’s book, Nowhere People. The nearly 400-page tome gathers the photographer’s decade of work documenting the lives of stateless people around the world, from Iraq to Kenya to Italy to Ukraine and the Dominican Republic—12 nations in total.</p>
<p>The quote from an unnamed subject, like Constantine’s photographs of stateless children and their families that appear throughout the book, alludes to the pressure that statelessness puts on parents and on young people born into an existence in which the very fact of their birth is unrecognized by any government. Denied citizenship in any country, the estimated 10 million stateless people around the world cannot obtain passports or bank accounts. Children born into statelessness will struggle to learn, to travel, to work, to marry, to have children of their own. Constantine’s book shows us, in black-and-white photographs, Bihari children learning despite being shut out of the Bangladeshi school system; a Dalit man and his grandson, representing a family that has lived for five generations in Nepal without recognition from the state; a group of young Nubian men sitting idly because they can’t find work in Kenya.</p>
<p>That these families and communities continue to survive and raise new generations on these shaky foundations is hard to fathom. Their perseverance, Constantine has said, is one of the primary reasons he’s continued and expanded his project from his initial focus on the Rohingya of Burma to document stateless people around the world. The author’s dedication to the communities he photographs is evident. While creating this work, Constantine has enlisted support from the United Nations, Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, Blue Earth Alliance, Open Society Foundations and Oak Foundation, among others, and has exhibited and shared these photographs around the world with policymakers and regular folks. Nowhere People, with it’s short, digestible histories of stateless communities and rich visual documentation, is both proof of the human spirit and confirmation of the cruelty of xenophobia, sectarianism and other forms of social elitism.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[In public, we’re surrounded by them—they’re hung on store and gallery walls; they’re mounted to the tops of taxis; they’re in people’s hands. They’re common, in other words, unremarkable. For some artists, they’re even limiting. Many storytellers are thinking beyond the single screen, creating immersive commercial and art installations that demand the attention of viewers. To learn more about the creative and technical considerations that go into developing multi-screen installations, <em>PDN</em> recently spoke with <a href="http://mirada.com/">Mirada</a>, a Los Angeles-based production studio, and with artist <a href="http://www.richardbarnes.net/">Richard Barnes</a>, who created multi-channel videos for a project about undocumented migrants.
<p><strong>MIRADA’S IMMERSIVE STORYTELLING FOR IBM</strong></p>
<p>“If you think back through the history of media, it’s only been in the last ten years that the screen has moved in front of your face, and only in the last hundred years of human history that people have looked at a screen,” notes Andrew Merkin, Head of Special Projects &amp; Transmedia at <a href="http://mirada.com/">Mirada</a>, a Los Angeles-based production studio. “It’s an artificial experience. You’re consolidating the entire world down to a 16:9 frame.”</p>
<p>By creating installations that rely on multiple, coordinated screens to engage viewers, storytellers are able to “breach that fourth wall of the media experience,” Merkin says. Part of the reason this works has to do with the way the human eye interacts with a screen. Generally, when we look at a screen, 25 to 30 percent of it is in focus, he explains, and everything else is in our peripheral vision. By using multiple screens to expand the storytelling canvas, even less of the overall “screen” is in focus and the experience is “that much more immersive because anywhere you look, the story is being told to you,” Merkin says. </p>
<p>“The key to storytelling for [an] immersive experience is that you’re no longer acting as a director being able to frame something. So much of it is thinking about the audience, thinking: ‘Where are they looking? Only 5 percent of what I’m doing right now is the focal point of what the audience is looking at, so if I make them turn their head, why am I making them turn their head? If I set off a sound in a different part of the room, I’m going to draw the attention of the audience to that sound. Is that something that I want to have happen?’ It becomes solely focused on the audience or the user themselves.”</p>
<p>IBM enlisted Mirada to create a “Client Interaction Center” for its Watson cognitive computing system. The <a href="https://mirada.wiredrive.com/present-reel/token/45ccd7b27e609b575d8593a6403ee3eb">multiscreen experience</a> gives each client a custom story that details how Watson would help them in their business. “It’s the first step in a long conversation and negotiation that IBM would be launching into, to see if Watson’s a good fit for these companies,” Mirada says.</p>
<p>The Watson CIC, a permanent installation in the Watson headquarters in New York City, uses a combination of standardized elements and custom elements to deliver a different narrative to each individual viewer based on their business. </p>
<p>“The goal is to not realize what is standardized and what is customized just for you,” Merkin explains. “It’s designed to be a seamless experience. We launched with two different modules, one for medical and one for financial consulting [professionals].” The idea was for Mirada to set up the system so the IBM creative team could then adapt it to create experiences for individuals in other professions. </p>
<p>IBM approached Mirada with a 16-week production schedule. “It was a very intense sprint to get these initial stories up,” Merkin recalls. Limited creative assets existed, so Mirada had to shoot footage, film interviews and create the majority of the content from scratch. The studio’s model, Merkin explains, is to draw on a pool of editors, directors of photography, interactive designers and other talent in order to quickly build a production staff for each project they take on. “At any time we can uncomfortably get up to about 300 people in the building, but we have a database of 12,000 people with various backgrounds that we can call, and build out the team according to the needs of [the job],” Merkin says.</p>
<p>When editing content for a multiscreen installation, “there is definitely a learning curve with understanding how the edit” will function for each installation. For another installation Mirada produced for IBM that existed temporarily at Lincoln Center in New York, Mirada built a mock-up of the ten-screen installation in their studio. “Being able to see a sample of their edit in the space gave [the editors] an understanding. Once editors get a sense of how the footage they edit will appear in an installation, however, “the speed with which they’re able to edit it is almost one-to-one with traditional film,” Merkin says.</p>

<p><strong>SIGMA QUATTRO DP0</strong></p>
<p>The fourth member of Sigma’s advanced compact family, the <a href="http://amzn.to/1J0lgKo">Sigma Quattro dp0</a> shares the same features as the other dp Quattro cameras but differs in the focal length of its fixed lens. The dp0 sports the widest-angle lens of the bunch—a 14mm f/4 lens, equivalent to a 21mm focal length on a 35mm camera. At the heart of Sigma’s distinctive-looking dp0 Quattro is the 29-megapixel APS-C-sized Foveon X3 Quattro image sensor, which features a proprietary three-layer design meant to replicate how film emulsions capture red, green and blue light. Working in tandem, these three layers create the equivalent of a 39-megapixel image and Sigma’s True III image processor crunches the data to output an image that the company claims delivers truer-to-life colors and more realistic images. Beyond the sensor, the dp0 offers 14-bit RAW image capture and an ISO range from 100 to 6400. The body design marries a thin, panoramic frame with a prominent grip that extends from the back of the camera, giving the dp0 a distinctive look. If 14mm is a bit too wide for you, Sigma has three other models in the Quattro family: the dp1 with a 19mm f/2.8 lens, the dp2 with a 30mm f/2.8 and the dp3, which features a 50mm focal length lens and the same f/2.8 maximum aperture. All carry the same price tag. <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/gear/Sigma-Announces-New--10295.shtml">Click here</a> to read our story with full details on the rest of the dp Quattro line.</p>

<p><strong>LEICA Q </strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://adorama.evyy.net/c/124294/51926/1036?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Filcq.html">Q</a> boasts a 24-megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor and a zippy 10fps burst mode thanks to its Maestro II image processor. If the fixed 28mm, f/1.7 ASPH lens is too wide for you, the camera has 35mm and 50mm modes that save cropped images as JPEGs while simultaneously preserving the full 28mm field of view as a RAW file. You’ll frame your scene through a 3-inch touch screen or a 3.68-megapixel electronic viewfinder that’s incredibly sharp. You can use the touch screen for touch focusing or to trigger the shutter the instant you select a touch focus point. A mechanical shutter delivers speeds up to 1/2000 sec. and you can access a faster, quieter electronic shutter for speeds up to 1/16,000 sec. The Q also features built-in Wi-Fi, 1080p60 video recording and a native ISO range of 100-50,000. It’s forged from an aluminum block and finished in magnesium with all external markings engraved with a laser for greater durability.

<p><strong>CANON POWERSHOT G3 X</strong></p>
<p>Canon is no stranger to plying tiny cameras with big sensors, and the <a href="http://amzn.to/1J0lReS">G3 X</a> is no exception. With a 1-inch, 20-megapixel CMOS sensor and built-in 24-600mm, f/2.8-5.6 lens, the G3 X is a versatile performer. ISO sensitivity can reach 12,800, and a five-axis hybrid image stabilization system keeps images sharp as you drop shutter speeds. The G3 X features a 3.2-inch touch screen tiltable display as well as Wi-Fi and NFC for wireless remote control and image transfers. You’ll enjoy continuous shooting at 5.9 fps and HD video recording up to 1080p60 with manual control over focus and exposure during filming. It’s built more like a DSLR in miniature than your typical compact camera, with a prominent hand grip for a comfortable hold. See our full review of the PowerShot G3 W <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/Camera-Review-Canon-PowerShot-G3-X-15194.shtml">here</a>. </p>

<p><strong>PANASONIC LUMIX FZ300</strong></p>
<p>The 12-megapixel <a href="http://adorama.evyy.net/c/124294/51926/1036?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2FIPCDMCFZ300.html">FZ300</a> packs an optical punch with a built-in 25-600mm Leica lens that maintains a constant f/2.8 aperture throughout the entire zoom range. Despite its long reach, the lens can focus down to 1 cm in macro mode. Like most new Panasonic cameras, it offers 4K video recording and three 4K Photo Modes—4K Burst, 4K Pre-Burst and 4K Start/Stop—to quickly isolate 8-megapixel still frames from 4K video files. In addition to 4K, you can record Full HD at up to 120 fps. You’ll enjoy a maximum ISO of 6400 and a five-axis hybrid image stabilization system to keep subjects sharp as you zoom out to 600mm. The camera features a 1,440K-dot OLED LVF with a 100 percent field of view when shooting in the 4:3 aspect ratio, plus a 3-inch, free-angle touchscreen display to help compose your scene. You can burst at speeds of up to 12 fps when shooting in AFS mode, or 6 fps with continuous AF engaged. The camera’s autofocus system can acquire focus in low light down to -3 EV, and has focus peaking to guide you during manual focusing. The AF system can achieve focus in as little as .09 seconds and shutter speeds hit 1/4000 sec. (mechanical) or 1/16,000 sec. (electronic). The FZ300 is splash- and dustproof, has built-in Wi-Fi, in-camera RAW processing and 22 creative filters.</p>

<p><strong>RICOH GR II</strong></p>
<p>Boasting a 16.2-megapixel APS-C-sized CMOS sensor with no optical low-pass filter, the <a href="http://amzn.to/1J0msxg">GR II</a> has a 28mm (35mm equivalent) fixed lens with an aperture of f/2.8 and a manually adjustable ND filter. The camera is capable of focusing on subjects up to 3.9 inches away from the lens. It features Wi-Fi and NFC and works with a pair of apps that let users view a live feed from the camera, adjust settings and share images wirelessly. The GR II has a native ISO range of 100-25,600, in-camera RAW processing and 1920x1080p30 video recording with the ability to adjust exposure and activate AF during filming. The AF system can lock on subjects in as little as 0.2 seconds and continuous shooting clocks in at 4 fps for RAW images. Thanks to an updated automatic white balance algorithm, the GR II does a better job shooting under fluorescent lights than its predecessor and also reduces the color bleed of green hues when shooting outdoors, according to Ricoh. The GR II offers 17 effects modes and shutter speeds up to 1/4000 sec. It sports a built-in flash but no built-in viewfinder. <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/gear/Ricoh-Intros-GR-II-Premium-Compact-Camera-13895.shtml">Click here</a> to read full details about the GR II.</p>

<p><strong>OLYMPUS STYLUS S1S</strong></p>
<p>The style of the <a href="http://adorama.evyy.net/c/124294/51926/1036?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2FIOMS1SB.html">S1s</a> hues close to the retro sensibility of Olympus’ OM-D mirrorless lineup, but without the interchangeable lenses. Instead, you’re outfitted with a 28-300mm (equivalent) lens that maintains a constant f/2.8 aperture through the zoom range. The camera offers a 1/1.7-inch backside-illuminated image sensor with the company’s TruePic VI processor to crunch the data. The S1s delivers a native ISO range of 100-1600, which is expandable to ISO 12,800. Unlike some of its compact peers, the Stylus S1s packs an electronic viewfinder. The 1.44-megapixel EVF lets you preview exposure adjustments in real time and has an eye sensor so you can quickly jump back-and-forth from the LCD to the EVF. Speaking of the display, you’ll enjoy a 3-inch tilting touchscreen with touch AF functionality. The Stylus S1s is fairly speedy, with a burst mode of 7 fps up to 25 RAW images or 70 JPEGs. Rounding out the feature set is Wi-Fi, 1920x1080p30 video recording and shutter speeds up to 1/2000 sec. </p>

<p><strong>SONY RX100 IV</strong></p>
<p>No action flick is complete without an epic slo-mo and Sony’s new <a href="http://amzn.to/1ReDIXj">RX100 IV</a> will definitely deliver that: It can record at a blistering 960 fps, albeit at a web-friendly 1136x384 resolution. If you want to trade higher resolution for slightly slower frame rates, the RX100 IV also has options for 480 fps (1676x566) and 240 fps (1824x1026) video recording. The camera is able to achieve its speed thanks to a new image sensor design which attaches a DRAM chip to the signal processing circuitry, thereby bumping up the memory buffer and allowing the data to flow more rapidly off the sensor—up to five times faster than conventional sensor designs, according to Sony. The brisk data movement also minimizes rolling shutter distortions, which will come in handy as the camera is capable of electronic shutter speeds up to 1/32,000 sec. In addition to being fast, the RX100 IV can record 4K video (3840x216) for up to five minutes a clip with clean HDMI output, time code, and Sony’s S-Log2 profile for easier post-process color grading. Still shooters aren’t left in the lurch, either. The RX100 IV features a 1-inch 20-megapixel Exmor RS CMOS sensor, a native ISO range of 125-12,800 and a built-in 24-70mm f/1.8-2.8 lens with a three-step ND filter. There’s a retractable OLED viewfinder and a 3-inch display that flips up 180-degrees for selfies. Set to speed-priority and the RX100 IV can hit 16 fps in continuous shooting mode. See our review of the RX100 IV, and Sony's other 2015 camera launches, <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/gear/Sony-s-Summer-of-Sequels-Launches-A7R-II-RX10-II-and-RX100-IV-13837.shtml">here.</a> </p>

<p>The <a href="http://amzn.to/1lBj2fG">Coolpix P7800</a> features a 12-megapixel CMOS image sensor measuring 1/1.7 inches. It packs a 28-200mm f/2 lens with Vibration Reduction to keep things steady even when you’re not. You’ll frame your scene through a 3-inch, vari-angle display or an electronic viewfinder. The P7800 clocks in with a burst mode of 8 fps for up to six images. It has a native ISO range of 80-1600 with an option to expand to 6400. Movies are recorded at 1920x1080p30 and there are 17 scene modes to choose from. If you want wireless control, you’ll need to spring for the optional WU-1a Wi-Fi adapter ($60).</p>

<p><strong>FUJIFILM X100T</strong></p>
<p>A favorite among street photographers, the <a href="http://adorama.evyy.net/c/124294/51926/1036?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2FIFJX100TS.html">X100T</a> marks the debut of a new “hybrid” viewfinder with an electronic rangefinder mode that Fuji says mimics the functions of a mechanical rangefinder for framing your composition through the viewfinder. The frame coverage of the EVF has been bumped from the 90 percent found in the X100S to 92 percent to give you a bit more accuracy when composing through the EVF. Image effects, such as film simulations, can be previewed in real time in the viewfinder as well. The X100T uses a 16.3-megapixel, APS-C-sized X-Trans CMOS II sensor and Fuji’s EXR Processor II technology. Its 23mm, f/2 fixed lens is equivalent to a 35mm lens on a full-frame camera and is capable of focusing on subjects as close as 10cm. Fuji has also tweaked the body design from the X100S, adding more controls over aperture in the aperture ring (now adjustable in 1/3 steps) as well as extending the exposure compensation dial by +/- three stops. There are seven customizable function buttons to bring your favorite settings front and center. The camera’s other highlights include 1080p60 HD video recording at a maximum bit rate of 36Mbps with manual focusing during video recording; high-speed shooting at 6 fps to 25 full resolution JPEGs and a 3-inch, 1.04-million dot LCD display. You’ll enjoy electronic shutter speeds of up to 1/32,000 sec. and Wi-Fi for mobile image viewing and camera control.

    <article_text><![CDATA[<em>As more photographers move into motion and promote their skills as directors, they can sometimes find themselves pulled in two directions on assignments, when the client wants them to deliver great stills as well as high-quality video. According to veteran photographer-directors PDN spoke to, the first step in managing a combined production is to separate the shoots for stills from the shoot for the video—by carrying them out at different times or in slightly separate locations. To ensure a smooth workflow, photographer-directors also have to adjust their lighting, the planning of their shots, and their directions to their crews.</em>
<p><em>In part three of this three-part series, Josh Rothstein describes his fashion-focused shoot for Cadillac and </em>Esquire <em>that produced stills and short documentary films about four creative, stylish men. Read part one of this series, about Danielle Levitt’s shoot for </em>I-D magazine<em>, <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/Combining-Still-and-Video-Productions-Danielle-Levitt-for-I-D-Magazine-15207.shtml">here.</a> Check out part two of this series, about Katrine Naleid and Stephen Austin Welch’s commercial assignment for Elmer’s, <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/Combining-Still-and-Video-Productions-Katrine-Naleid-and-Stephen-Austin-Welch-for-Elmer-s-15292.shtml">here.</a></em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.joshrothstein.com/">Josh Rothstein</a> began his career as a filmmaker in the Nineties, working on long-form documentaries. But when work was scarce, he parlayed an interest in photography into freelance photo work. Eventually, it was as much a career as his filmmaking. And as the demand for multimedia content increased, Rothstein began combining his photography and directing skills on assignments. He has filmed and photographed Hugh Jackman for one of the philanthropies the actor supports, shot photos and video of Usain Bolt for Puma, and recently completed a campaign called <a href="http://lookbooks.com/marketplace/utopia/news/esquire-cadillac-men-of-style-encapsulated-video-by-josh-rothstein">“Men of Style Encapsulated,”</a> an online and print feature for <em>Esquire</em> that was sponsored by Cadillac.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cadillac supported the project in its capacity as the exclusive automotive sponsor of New York Fashion Week: Men’s. “Men of Style Encapsulated” &nbsp;features four creative men: artist <a href="http://lovemewashere.com/">Curtis Kulig</a>, DJ/producer <a href="http://brenmar.biz/">Brenmar</a>, photographer <a href="http://seansullivanphoto.com/">Sean Sullivan</a>, and chef <a href="http://thececilharlem.com/chefs.html">JJ Johnson</a>. The assignment called for a fashion shoot with each subject, wearing <em>Esquire</em> editor-approved duds, and a two-minute, day-in-the-life documentary. In the videos, the men scurried around New York City in a Cadillac, and also discussed their craft, life and how the city plays a role in their creative process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From concept to premiere, “Men of Style Encapsulated” was a ten-month endeavor, according to Hearst Men’s Group Art Director, <a href="http://guru.versusdsn.com/">George Garrastegui, Jr.</a> And much had already gone on behind the scenes before Rothstein was brought on. Though the videos were primarily documentary, Garrastegui says he and his team wanted them to reflect <a href="http://www.dare-greatly.com/">Cadillac’s “Dare Greatly”</a> campaign, which features pioneers in different fields, such as Steve Wozniak and Richard Linklater, in order to position Cadillac as an innovative brand. The “Dare Greatly” spots employ luxury car ad techniques such as lens flare, gritty but picturesque city streets, and the majesty of slow motion. But the ads focus on the celebrity innovators as much as—if not more than—the car.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Men of Style Encapsulated” called for a similar approach. Former Hearst executive creative director <a href="http://www.alisondebenedictis.com/">Alison DeBenedictis</a> had worked previously with Rothstein &nbsp;on projects for Guess and Diesel. She hired him knowing he could manage both the still and video components of “Men of Style Encapsulated,” and strike a balance between the documentary, fashion and car advertising styles that she wanted for the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rothstein shot one video per day, with an hour set aside for stills. “It isn’t a lot of time,” he admits, “but it’s enough if you’re incredibly dialed into your production.” Pre-production was comprehensive, and Rothstein and his production partner, Jesse Scolaro, spent much time developing each subject’s story. Rothstein &nbsp;conducted pre-interviews with the subjects over the phone, and then met them in-person at their fittings, long before stepping on set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We wanted to pull a story from our subjects that’s true to who they are,” he says. “It’s also just developing a rapport with your subject—it accomplishes a lot of things.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pre-interviews were essentially used as scripts for “Men of Style Encapsulated,” and they informed Rothstein’s meticulous location scouts and shot list. But the director notes that details from the actual on-camera interviews served as a guide for what to focus on while shooting b-roll later that same day.</p>
<p>In order to complete so much shooting in one day, and gather footage in both documentary and advertising styles, Rothstein hired two cinematographers: <a href="http://noahyv.com/v3/">Noah Yuan-Vogel,</a> a run-and-gun pro responsible for most of the documentary footage, and <a href="http://www.joncarrpro.com/">Jon Carr</a>, who handled the detailed beauty shots. They used Sony NEX-FS700s and Rothstein instructed them to shoot as much as possible, whether b-roll of New York City from the window of their cab en route to set, or slow-motion footage of a Cadillac as it was being parked during Rothstein’s photoshoot. (Though there were no storyboards, Cadillac provided style guides showing the best ways to film each car.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tight schedule demanded transparency and trust between director, crew and client. During the photo shoot, for example, a digital tech managed a laptop that allowed Rothstein and the folks from <em>Esquire</em> and Cadillac to examine and sign off on the photos on the spot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You don’t have time to be overly precious and guarded about every single frame because it’s everyone’s baby,” Rothstein says. “Even with the video, I had portable handheld monitors, and I’m making sure George [Garrastegui of <em>Esquire</em>] can see it, so if there are any problems we can address them immediately—there’s no margin for error.”</p>
<p>As for serving as both director and photographer, wearing both hats no longer frazzles Rothstein. But it can be jarring to subjects. On the first day, Rothstein noticed artist Curtis Kulig looking uncomfortable in front of his Canon 5D Mark II after an otherwise fruitful and relaxed day shooting documentary footage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There’s a bit of hand-holding that needs to happen,” Rothstein says. “I would shoot, run over, make a couple jokes [to] keep it loose, and also let them know that [the sudden switch from director to photographer] is a little awkward. That’s a big part of that process: Managing your subject when they’re real people going between these two mediums; being aware that it’s not the most comfortable thing in the world; and staying present for someone when things are so frenetic. And that allows you to feel more comfortable as well, as a director and photographer.” <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">	</span></p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<em>As more photographers move into motion and promote their skills as directors, they can sometimes find themselves pulled in two directions on assignments, when the client wants them to deliver great stills as well as high-quality video. According to veteran photographer-directors </em>PDN <em>spoke to, the first step in managing a combined production is to separate the shoots for stills from the shoot for the video—by carrying them out at different times or in slightly separate locations. To ensure a smooth workflow, photographer-directors also have to adjust their lighting, the planning of their shots, and their directions to their crews. </em>
<p><em>In part two of this three-part series, Katrine Naleid and Stephen Austin Welch explain how they planned and produced a shoot for Elmer’s. Read part one of this series, about Danielle Levitt’s shoot for </em>I-D magazine<em>, <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/Combining-Still-and-Video-Productions-Danielle-Levitt-for-I-D-Magazine-15207.shtml">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Having collaborated on ad campaigns for more than ten years, the San Francisco-based directing/photography duo <a href="http://www.knsaw.com/">Katrine Naleid and Stephen Austin Welch</a> have found that one of the advantages of shooting assignments that combine motion work and stills is that preproduction planning for the video can elevate the still production and help the shoot run more smoothly. On a recent assignment from <a href="http://www.sbcadvertising.com/">SBC Advertising</a> in Columbus, Ohio, the duo directed a 30-second TV commercial for Elmer’s glue and then, on a second shoot day, shot a series of lifestyle images for the new Elmer’s website. Planning, scouting and casting took three weeks. “We used that time to develop ideas for the stills,” Welch says. He says of the pre-production process, “It’s an investment in quality that allows us to make the most of the shoot days.”</p>
<p>Welch and Naleid, both experienced photographers, have been co-directing motion projects for several years. They have worked out a division of labor in which Welch, who went to film school and worked on movies before launching his photography career, typically focuses on the lighting and directing the crew and sometimes shooting b-roll while Naleid concentrates on directing talent. On some jobs, Welch has shot video over Naleid’s shoulder as she is capturing stills. They promote their work  separately and together, under the brand <a href="http://www.knsaw.com/">KN+SAW</a>. SBC contacted them about the Elmer’s job after agency creatives working on both parts of the campaign pulled the duo’s promos. </p>
<p>From the beginning, they contributed ideas to the production. In initial creative calls, chief creative officer Neil Widerschein had explained that Elmer’s wanted to move away from touting the glue’s technical properties and build a lifestyle campaign, <a href="http://www.knsaw.com/lets-bond/index.html">“Let’s Bond,”</a> showing parents and their kids working on craft projects together. Welch and Naleid offered suggestions for scenarios to shoot. Once they landed the job, they collaborated with the agency on a script rewrite.  </p>
<p>Naleid and Welch say that on video assignments, more than on still shoots, creatives “want to see where you can take their idea,” Welch says. That experience has influenced how they communicate their ideas to ad agency creatives, they say. They now submit treatments whenever they’re bidding on a  campaign—whether it requires stills or motion—in order to “put our best foot forward,” Naleid says. </p>
<p>For the Elmer’s shoots, Welch and Naleid had suggested finding a single location where they could photograph all three family scenes. At the suggestion of their production company, <a href="http://www.travelingpictureshow.tv/">Traveling Picture Show Company</a>, they chose a house in Minneapolis where they could shoot each family in a different room. To ensure chemistry among the actors, they spent a lot of time on casting the seven actors—who included a real-life mom and son.  </p>
<p>During pre-production, they also storyboarded each shot to determine camera placement.  “If you need the camera to move, you need time for that, and you need to know why,” says Welch. They went over the storyboard with the client while touring the set, explaining how each shot added to the story. </p>
<p>“It gets the client emotionally invested in what we’re doing, so on the shoot day they’re not saying, ‘Why are we doing this shot—we need to show the glue bottle.’ Everybody understands why we’ve scripted these shots,” he says.  Naleid adds that while they scouted, “We were able to look at it with the eyes of photographers,” and begin planning their shots and lighting for the still shoot.</p>
<p>They shot the video with an Arri Alexa, which they like for its dynamic range, using Cooke lenses. To mimic sunlight, they set up HMI lights outside the windows. A lightning storm on the shoot day forced them to tent all the lights; batteries provided alternative power when the storm caused the electricity to go out. </p>
<p>Naleid and Welch always set up a “video village,” with a monitor and some comfortable seating, where the creatives and client can watch what’s being captured. The video village is in a separate room from the shoot—so the actors aren’t seeing the clients’ reactions.  The monitor remained in the same location while Naleid shot stills with a tethered Canon 5D Mark III. </p>
<p>While the video shoot required a crew of 40, they worked with many fewer people on the still shoot. Naleid and Welch used Profoto strobes softened with silks and bounced the light around the room to create a natural-looking light similar to what they had achieved with HMIs. During the video shoot they were focused on creating a narrative, but while shooting a Canon 5D Mark III handheld, Naleid looked for close-ups and interactions: “With the still camera in your hand, there’s freedom to say, ‘Let’s try this.’ With video, you’re dialed in, it’s all scheduled in advance.” </p>
<p>Welch says, “We strive to follow a project as far as we can, and that means we try to be in the editing booth on the first day.” He and Naleid had negotiated time with the editor as part of the assignment. After doing some rough cuts of favorite shots “on the fly,” Welch flew to the editing studio in Los Angeles at his own expense, and brought along a hard drive of favorite footage. Says Welch, “You want to put your stamp on it, so we make sure the first cut [clients] see is our cut.”  The finished commercial and the stills Naleid and Welch delivered both capture intimate and natural looking family scenes, and together represent the duo’s style. </p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<em>PDN’s</em> editors—and a pair of guest reviewers—selected 15 book that caught our attention this year, from a troubling photo album to a new look at America’s heartland; from books of historic photos that add new perspectives to key social issues of our time, to books that explore how photographs and image fragments combine to tell a story. Below is Part 2 of our list of notable books of the year. Read Part 1 of our list <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/Notable-Photo-Books-of-2015-Part-1-15224.shtml">here</a>.
<p><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/12-Books-04-Annette-Behrens-In-Matters-of-Karl-01-cover-a.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://fw-photography.nl/product/annette-behrens-in-matters-of-karl/">(IN MATTER OF) KARL.</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Edited by Annette Behrens&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fw: Books</strong></p>
<p><strong>128 pages</strong></p>
<p><strong>$37.50</strong></p>
<p>How must we reckon with grievous epochs in our history? Does erasure and forgetting lay the groundwork for rebuilding, or does silence whitewash the bloody record of our ignominious past? Is there room for compromise between such extremes, or must we adopt fixed and antagonistic positions?</p>
<p>These are some of the foundational questions at work in <a href="http://www.annettebehrens.com/">Annette Behrens’</a> remarkable book <em>(in Matter Of) Karl</em>. In it, Behrens contends with photography’s capacity to reveal and to seal away in wordlessness the many facets of Germany’s Nazi history. The subject of the book is Karl H&ouml;cker, owner of an album of photographs made by high-ranking Nazi officers and auxiliary personnel while running the concentration camps of Auschwitz and Auschwitz-Birkenau, both camps at which H&ouml;cker served as deputy commander during the Second World War. The photographs are part of the archive of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and are the only candid record of the daily life of the Nazis who administered the genocide undertaken in both camps.</p>
<p>This is a nuanced, complex and extraordinarily forthright book that contains rigorous, insightful and evocative research. It is thoroughly and conscientiously contextualized, and it is narrated in Behrens’s small diaristic entries, which detail her immersion into this history, and her ambivalence about the results of her diligent intervention. Behrens’s investigation of H&ouml;cker’s photographs opens up old wounds in some who knew him, and in her repeated trips to the Nazi retreat at Solahutte, Behrens reminds us of how hard some have worked to forget or to disavow this complex history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book compels us to deal with the dangers of forgetting our past, and asks us to consider the moral challenges involved in any effort to retrieve what has been suppressed. Behrens confronts photography’s tendency to seem like a grossly insufficient gesture in the face of unforgivable acts, and it simultaneously examines photography’s capacity to give us a means to dismantle repression, and come face to face with the iniquities of our past.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1HYygVQ">BLANK PAGES OF AN IRANIAN PHOTO ALBUM</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>By Newsha Tavakolian</strong></p>
<p><strong>144 pages</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kehrer Verlag</strong></p>
<p><strong>$65</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.newshatavakolian.com/">Newsha Tavakolian</a> opens her introduction to her new book with these words: “One of the most precious possessions for every Iranian household is the family photo album.” The photo albums documenting her generation, however, typically end in blank pages, Tavakolian says, because the family stopped documenting their moments of joy and pride. “Is that the moment that some became bitter? Or the moment they left the country?” she wonders. In the absence of self-representation, Iranians became subject to outsiders’ perceptions of the country, which tend to focus on its extremists. <em>Blank Pages of an Iranian Photo Album </em>is Tavakolian’s attempt to counter foreigners’ views by showing moments in the lives of nine ordinary, lower-middle class Iranians.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each chapter is focused on a different individual. It begins with an old family photo of Tavokolian’s subject and then a few sentences in their own words, which give context for the images that follow: Najieh, a mother, explaining why she is “raising my two sons with Islamic values”; Fahti, who took a job as a maid after her husband lost his job and “I hit rock bottom”; Mehdi, a caf&eacute; owner, who says the faces of the young people having snacks and coffee show “how numb they’ve become”; Bita, a model about to undergo lip augmentation, discussing the struggle to make money working Tehran’s underground catwalk shows or the less glamorous, publicly sanctioned runway shows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to her reportage-style photos of these individuals in the course of their day, Tavakolian observes life going on around them: A taxi driver eyeing the photographer, men hovering at a food stall, a woman peeking under the paper that covers a street poster showing a fashion ad; a mom and kids under a playful mural in a pre-school; a traffic circle seen through parted window curtains. Each chapter includes a posed portrait of the subject taken in a park overlooking Tehran amidst tangled branches and messy patches of grass. The photographer says she hopes her book “communicates the feeling of people here,” and it manages to convey a mix of wistfulness and unease, melancholy and ebullience.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>By Danny Lyon</strong></p>
<p><strong>Phaidon</strong></p>

<p>After documenting the Civil Rights movement in the mid 1960s, photojournalist <a href="http://www.houkgallery.com/artists/danny-lyon/">Danny Lyon</a> turned his camera on the Texas prison system. He spent 14 months photographing inside six different prisons, earning the trust of a number of inmates along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I was not interested in improving prisons. I wanted to destroy them,” he said at a talk he gave at the annual <em>National Geographic</em> seminar in 2014. First published by Henry Holt in 1971, <em>Conversations with the Dead</em> was a seminal work of documentary photography not only because of Lyon’s immersive “New Journalism” approach, but because it was one of the first photo books to incorporate arrest reports, court documents, prisoners’ artwork and letters, and other ephemera.</p>
<p>First edition copies are now collectible, but Phaidon has recently issued a digitally remastered facsimile edition, making the book accessible to new audiences. (In 2014, Phaidon issued a retrospective of Lyon’s complete oeuvre called <em><a href="http://www.phaidon.com/store/photography/the-seventh-dog-9780714848532/">The Seventh Dog</a></em>, while Aperture re-issued <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1HYyVXq">The Bikeriders</a></em><a href="http://amzn.to/1HYyVXq">,</a> originally published in 1968).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lyon’s black-and-white photographs of prisoners are so striking because they’re shot at close range, with much attention to detail and nuance. They capture the experience of incarceration in a visceral way. He makes a case for the injustice and futility of the system through the mind-numbing boredom, drudgery and humiliations of prisoner’s day-to-day lives.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, prison conditions haven’t improved, and the Texas prison population has exploded from 12,500 inmates when Lyon did the work to more than 200,000 inmates today. “If, back in 1968, I thought I could bring down the mighty walls of the Texas prison system by publishing [this book],” he writes in the introduction of the new edition, “then those years of my work are among the greatest failures of my life.” But it’s brilliant work just the same.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">	</span></p>

<p><strong>By Matthew Porter</strong></p>
<p><strong>MACK</strong></p>
<p><strong>132 pages, 145 color photographs</strong></p>
<p><strong>$50</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://matthewporterphoto.com/">Matthew Porter’s</a> <em>Archipelago</em>, one of the best photobooks I have seen in a while, is not an easily accessible book. What makes it complex and, ultimately, so refreshing and rewarding is that it employs an elliptical way of telling a story that may frustrate those looking for something simpler, with a linear narrative that carries them from a clear and obvious beginning to an equally clear and obvious ending.</p>
<p>Instead, <em>Archipelago </em>works with what photographs do when they are placed in conversation with other images. The majority of spreads in the book contain groups of pictures. Porter also uses similar images throughout the book as visual echoes that tie the spreads to one another.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Archipelago</em> begins with images of a boat and a sunrise, and then carries the viewer to an island of lizards, rough terrain, strange artifacts, and a few young women explorers. Assuming the perspective of the explorers, the viewer is taken on a tour of the island, inspecting its terrain, flora and fauna. She finds people living on the island, and then she leaves again. The discovery and exploration are the story; what the viewer makes of them is up to her.</p>
<p>If anything, the book shows what you can do with pictures when you abandon the idea of “from here to there,” instead creating a world that encourages viewers to discover things through the photographer’s eyes and become a more active participant in unearthing a story. Photography is a way of making sense of the world—<em>Archipelago</em> makes this clear.</p>
<p>Porter’s book requires patience, which may make the book difficult for some people. But those willing to give it time will enjoy the rewards of beautiful photographs, and strange visual combinations and echoes across spreads. Best of all, while the book could have easily been just clever, it is a lot more than that.</p>

<p><strong>By Paolo Woods and Gabriele Galimberti</strong></p>
<p><strong>Essay by Nicholas Shaxson</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dewi Lewis</strong></p>
<p><strong>224 pages, 80 photographs</strong></p>
<p><strong>$65</strong></p>
<p>To better understand the tax havens corporations and rich people use to avoid taxes and financial regulation in their home countries, <a href="http://www.paolowoods.net/">Paolo Woods</a> and <a href="http://www.gabrielegalimberti.com/projects-2/">Gabriele Galimberti</a> spent two years following the money. They traveled to Switzerland, Panama, Cayman Islands, Jersey, British Virgin Islands and other places that offer a variety of methods to stash money, set up shell corporations and elude government oversight. As Woods notes in the book’s introduction, tax dodging is not an obviously visual subject. Stories about tax havens are usually illustrated with stock shots of palm trees on a tropical beach. Woods and Galimberti instead photographed people and institutions who make the global tax-evasion system run: rows of post office boxes in the Cayman Islands; the chief deputy secretary of state in Delaware in his office in the Wilmington State Building where 300 companies are incorporated each day; the finance minister of the British Virgin Islands looking out his office window at, yes, palm trees. They also made numerous photographs of the trappings of wealth and the people who depend on it: a gardener trimming the hedge at a palatial home in Jersey; an architect and builder in the Cayman Islands surveying the site of a new development; high school students in the British Virgin Islands taking part in a financial services class; a heroin addict and prostitute in Wilmington, Delaware, shown at home with her mom. All the photos are bright and crisply detailed, suggesting that the photographers are shining a light on a shadowy system based on secrecy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book’s format imitates a corporate annual report: Woods and Galimberti went to Delaware and, for a tiny fee, quickly set up a corporation called The Heavens LLC. “We now owned a company in a tax haven,” Woods writes. “The book you are holding in your hands is our global company’s annual report.” However, <em>The Heavens </em>is far more lively, intriguing and alarming than anything I can imagine a corporate communications department producing.</p>
<p>Many of the images have a deadpan humor that is well matched by the sometimes ironic tone of Nicholas Shaxson’s text. Authoritative and highly readable, his essay explains in detail how this complicated economic ecosystem allows the rich and powerful to avoid oversight. He explains how schemes set up to protect wealth affect individuals both locally and internationally, and how all of us who patronize hundreds of corporations large and small participate in the ruse.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.dewilewis.com/products/when-i-was-six">WHEN I WAS SIX</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>78 pages, 42 photos</strong></p>

<p>Most of us take photos to preserve memories. In his modest but affecting new book, <a href="http://www.mrtoledano.com/">Phillip Toledano</a> uses photography to examine what has been forgotten, to envision remembered dreams and to imagine a past that never existed. When Toledano was six, his sister, Claudia, died; she was nine. He writes in the book that he has almost no memory of Claudia, but he recalls that around the time of her death, he developed a fascination with astronomy and distant planets. One of the first photos in the book shows the surface of a planet and a tiny astronaut in a space suit hovering in the infinite black space just outside the planet’s gravitational pull. It’s an apt metaphor for the feeling of being adrift in the void left by the death of a loved one. After his father’s death, Toledano opened the box in which his mother had stored Claudia’s drawings, snapshots, birth certificate, a locket of her hair, a porcelain giraffe and other items from her room. Toledano’s still-life photographs of these mementoes offer clues to what his sister was like, and also force us to imagine what his parents were thinking as they packed away the remnants of their child’s life into a plain cardboard box. (Full disclosure: My parents had two of these boxes, one labeled “Tommy’s Toys” and the other “Tommy’s Clothes,” which they carried along every time they moved to a new house in the four decades after my brother died at the age of five. Unlike Toledano, I haven’t had the guts to open them.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Toledano photographed Claudia’s belongings and his imaginary planets in a similar light and style. A note to her parents decorated with Magic Marker drawings is suspended against a dark background and illuminated by a glancing beam of light. The asteroids and hazy landscapes of strange planets that Toledano seems to have created out of fabric, rocks and dust are also lit by shafts of light that appear to come from a distant, unseen sun. One of the most poignant objects shown in the book did not belong to Claudia; it’s a page from a family album showing Toledano at his school’s sports day, just two week’s after his sister’s death. He writes, “I seem so happy. What did my parents tell me? What could they have told me?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to publishing <em>When I Was Six</em> this year, Toledano also published the book <em><a href="http://www.dewilewis.com/products/maybe">Maybe</a></em>, in which he uses makeup, prosthetics, hair dye and costumes to create a series of self portraits that show how he might age if the predictions of geneticists and fortune tellers come true. <em>When I Was Six</em>, however, explores not alternative futures but an alternative past. Toledano says of Claudia, “I miss who she might have been, and who I might have been if I’d had her as a sister.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>When I Was Six </em>was published in an edition of only 500 numbered copies, which surprises me. I am sure there are more than 500 of us who appreciate what Toledano has attempted to do in the book: to envision a person who, by her absence, exerted such influence on his imagination, and to honor the strength his mother and father summoned to carry on being caring and devoted parents.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://stanleybarker.co.uk/books/opening-the-sky/">OPENING THE SKY</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>By Larry Fink</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stanley / Barker</strong></p>
<p><strong>112 pages, 48 B&amp;W photographs</strong></p>
<p><strong>$75</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who’s passed time in the Central Cascades or on the Olympic Peninsula has noticed evidence of the timber industry’s lengthy history in Washington State: the uniform spacing of trees in new growth forests; the massive stumps lingering in a clear cut; the switchbacks of logging roads; the old mills and the once-prosperous towns that diminished with the supply of beautiful old trees. For those of a certain age who grew up in the Northwest, the fight between timber companies and environmentalists attempting to protect Spotted Owl habitat is an indelible memory, one in a series of muddy regional conflicts between those struggling for their livelihoods and those fighting the tide of development.</p>
<p>When <a href="http://www.larryfinkphotography.com/">Larry Fink</a> got a call from the Seattle Art Museum in 1980, offering him a commission to produce a body of work on a subject of his choosing in Washington State, Fink chose to make photographs of loggers. He’d been living on a farm, cutting wood from the forest to heat the home he lived in. After four years of “pain and hardening,” he writes in the introduction to the new book that collects his work from that commission, “my imagination allowed me to be who I wasn’t. I WAS A LOGGER.” This notion was quickly dispelled when Fink and his minder, “A gypo (freelance) logger” named Dave McCardle, got into the first logging camp he was to photograph. “We posed no threat, but were treated as if we had the plague. It was the plague of the outsider.”</p>
<p>Despite his alien status, Fink still managed to make photographs with his Mamiya CC30 and Leica M2 that are sensitive to the telling details of a logger’s life. Photos of men sleeping in their work-wear with hats pulled down over their eyes show how exhausting their work is; raw, cluttered, wood stove-heated cabins indicate time for work and little else. Fink dedicates a majority of his book to images of the dangerous labor itself. His photos are matter of fact and, at times, heroic in the way they depict the men against the scale of their work. Looking at his black-and-white images today, it’s hard not to notice the loggers navigating piles of branches, tangles of destruction of their own making, or the remote, mountainous landscapes, stripped in favor of manmade projects elsewhere. In many photographs, clear cuts of varying sizes form dead spaces with little detail. And while we may lament the loss of ancient forests and be thankful that sustainable practices continue to develop, Fink’s portraits acknowledge the humanity of the timber industry’s laborers, and make it difficult to find fault with the loggers in pursuit of a hard living.</p>

<p><strong>IMPERIAL COURTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>By Dana Lixenberg&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Roma Publications</strong></p>
<p><strong>269 pages, B&amp;W photos throughout</strong></p>
<p><strong>$77</strong></p>
<p>The work in <em>Imperial Courts </em>began after the riots in South Central Los Angeles in April 1992, which followed the acquittal of four police officers for the brutal beating of Rodney King, an incident caught on videotape and subsequently broadcast around the world. The last photographs in the book were made after the death of Freddie Gray, who suffered a severed spine and died in a coma after his arrest on the streets of Baltimore in April 2015. Gray’s arrest was filmed, and the footage of his screams circulated the globe during a period of acute and sustained attention to the deaths of unarmed African-American men at the hands of the police.</p>
<p>These are the chronological boundaries that frame this work: The link of crisis and death to public interest in the underserved minority communities of the United States. But such events are not the book’s subject matter, nor does it take as its premise an equivalence between African-American identity and violence. Instead, <em>Imperial Courts</em> tracks the changing shape and of a small, inner-city community within South Central Los Angeles through a beautiful series of portraits of its distinctive inhabitants. It marks the generational passing of time as sons become grandfathers, daughters become mothers, and parents, neighbors and friends pass silently into the grave at the turning of a page.</p>
<p>This is a measured, attentive, powerful body of work. <a href="http://www.huismarseille.nl/en/exhibition/dana-lixenberg/">Lixenberg’s</a> luminous photographs do not fixate on calamity, nor do they pathologize poverty. They measure the weight of time in the shaping of identity, and explore the fragility and resilience of fundamental social and familial bonds. Behind the changes in the faces of people Lixenberg photographs for twenty years or more, we see an unwavering constancy of marginal economic life that shames this nation.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[&nbsp;Lucky Banks Eats (LBE), a blog about "people, places and edible things," is a collaboration between two creatives in pursuit of adventure and freelance work: photographer Diana Zalucky and professional foodie and writer Ali Banks. Launched last spring, the blog features interviews, recipes, stories, and photography from their travels around the US and beyond. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
"I look at this as fun, but it is going to get us both work eventually," says Zalucky, adding that she has already landed several assignments on the strength of treatments featuring images she shot for the blog. <br />
<br />
Rep Cynthia Held says she's always encouraging her photographers to pursue personal projects "to stretch [their] style, and keep the energy level going." Zalucky takes the advice to heart. "She understands the power of sustained visibility. She doesn't expect that things are going to drop into her lap. She creates projects to build on her style and her future," Held says.<br />
<br />
Zalucky says that since launching her freelance career several years ago, she has focused on shooting lifestyle images she thought photo editors and creative directors wanted to see. But because clients expect to see a constant flow of new work, she found herself feeding a maw of other peoples' expectations. She was stressed, and struggling to stay motivated and inspired.<br />
<br />
She had an epiphany in Alaska last year, after trekking there to shoot a personal project about a dog musher she had read about in a magazine. "For four days straight I was out there in negative 30 degrees, asking myself, Why am I doing this?" she says. The answer, she realized when she'd warmed back up and had a bunch of pictures she really liked, was: "It's fun! It's exciting. If you're not uncomfortable, you're not growing."<br />
<br />
Zalucky says it was her love of "adventure, dirt and grit" that drew her to Alaska. And it got her thinking about other things she loves doing--traveling, meeting people, eating good food and fashion. "As photographers, we can make a project out of anything that interests us," she says. "I decided to follow the things that make me happy. What am I interested in? What makes me happy? If it spawns into [assignment] work, that makes me happier, but my concern is not getting work immediately."<br />
<br />
Zalucky met Banks at Eat Retreat, an annual workshop and networking event for foodies, in 2013. Since then, they have frequently gone on food-inspired adventures together. "We decided to start documenting [our trips]. And it forces me to always be creating new work," Zalucky says. <br />
<br />
They came up with the idea of collaborating on a food blog last year during a trip to Sitka, Alaska. They went because Zalucky wanted to photograph her friend Marsh Skeele, who is a commercial salmon fisherman, for her portfolio. "There were so many mini stories on that trip, we realized we needed to make something out of it," Zalucky says.<br />
<br />
While in Sitka, they also photographed and wrote recipes for miso salmon and balsamic berry crostata, produced a story about a wholesome breakfast (including the crostata) that they enjoyed on the waterfront with friends, and on their way back to the airport, did a story about one of those friends--coffee connoisseur Chris Bryner--who sells pour-over coffee in Sitka from a street vendor's tricycle. <br />
<br />
"It's inspiration and ideas, and so much fun when we're together," Zalucky says. <br />
<br />
They launched LBE in June, with a commitment to upload two posts per month. "It forces me to always be creating new work for us," Zalucky says. The schedule has also honed their skills at finding some connection to food in almost any subject. And the blog gives them license to photograph and interview just about anyone they're curious about.<br />
<br />
For instance, Zalucky went to Oregon to photograph a professional rock climber. "It was something I was personally interested in," she says. Afterwards, Zalucky and Banks turned it into an LBE blog post by interviewing the climber about how she manages to enjoy food and wine while staying fit.<br />
<br />
But most of the posts are more directly related to food. A couple of recipes were inspired by people they met and dishes they ate at Eat Retreat where they first met. "We are in constant communication with each other, bouncing ideas for future posts," Zalucky says. "When I see an interesting ingredient abroad, Ali will come up with a recipe for it." Looking ahead, she adds, "I want to make a cookbook out of this."<br />
<br />
One challenge is collaborating from a distance, with busy schedules. Zalucky is in Los Angeles, while Banks is in Chicago, currently working for a gourmet retailer, Pastoral Artisan Cheese, Bread &amp; Wine. They periodically get together in one city or the other to brainstorm and shoot new recipes, building an inventory of future blog posts. Banks does the cooking, styling and writing. "It's about being consistent, fleshing out details, and working together," Zalucky says. <br />
<br />
She worries, though, that clients might see the blog and think of her "as just a food shooter." She also worries that the demands of the blog could strain her friendship with Banks. And she feels nervous about her edits for the blog posts. But she's steadfast. "You don't surrender to those critics on your shoulder," she says. "That's what separates people who do things from those who don't."<br />
<br />
Another challenge is to build traffic to the blog. Banks is reaching out to her extensive food industry contacts, while Zalucky has been notifying her photo editors and ad agency contacts. They also take turns managing social media to get the word out.<br />
<br />
Zalucky says the LBE project underscores the difference between pushing herself as a photographer, and letting herself be pulled. By pushing too hard, she says, her work sometimes ends up feeling contrived. "If I base things on being pulled, I'm in flow and moving past doubt and fear. That is when you start to create work that will connect with people," she says. "Forget about photography for a second. What do you want to experience as a human being? That's your next personal project."]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<em>PDN’s</em> editors—and a pair of guest reviewers—selected 15 books that caught our attention this year, from a troubling photo album to a new look at America’s heartland; from books of historic photos that add new perspectives to key social issues of our time, to books that explore how photographs and image fragments combine to tell a story. Below is Part 1 of our list of notable books of the year. You can find <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/Notable-Photo-Books-of-2015-Part-2-15275.shtml">Part 2 here</a>.

<p><strong><a href="http://www.avarie-publishing.com/#kdb">I DO NOT WANT TO DISAPPEAR SILENTLY INTO THE NIGHT</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>By Katrien de Blauwer</strong></p>
<p><strong>Avarie</strong></p>
<p><strong>178 pages, 140 B&amp;W and color images</strong></p>
<p><strong>$125</strong></p>
<p>Collage is like photography: It is very easy to make a picture, yet it is very hard to do it well. This is particularly true of works that use few elements: A collage assembled from dozens of pieces might get away with a little sloppiness here or there. But once you're down to the smallest number of elements possible—two—things have to work out perfectly. <a href="http://www.katriendeblauwer.com/">Katrien de Blauwer</a> operates in this terrain. Sourcing photographs from old magazines, she carefully isolates smaller parts and places two of them next to each other, usually on old pieces of paper that betray their ages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dialogues that de Blauwer is able to establish between the two image fragments cover a much wider range than her contemporary <a href="http://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/john_stezaker.htm">John Stezaker's</a>. Stezaker's collages are clever for sure, and very cerebral. But they remain there, in that intellectual space. In contrast, De Blauwer's collages are deeply emotional, even where they intrude in Stezaker's territory. There is a softness of touch, a gentleness to them. For the most part, these collages are less visual riddles that ask to be solved than fragments of tales, which cannot be solved, and which allude to everything else not included in them.</p>
<p><em>I do not want to disappear silently into the night</em> (<a href="http://www.avarie-publishing.com/#kdb">published by Avarie</a>) is a very handsome and slightly unassuming collection of a large number of De Blauwer's collages. What could have easily been a somewhat dry, if not boring, catalogue has been turned into an engaging book through the addition of additional materials, such as added texts (a collage of fragments from Michelangelo Antonioni's unfinished screenplays) and details of backgrounds used by the artist.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1XQrOYb">DIRT MERIDIAN</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>By Andrew Moore</strong></p>
<p><strong>Preface by Kent Haruf; texts by Toby Jurovics and Inara Verzemnieks</strong></p>
<p><strong>Damiani</strong></p>
<p><strong>140 pages, 73 color photographs</strong></p>
<p><strong>$50</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.andrewlmoore.com/">Andrew Moore’s</a> photographs of the landscape along the 100th meridian show a sparsely populated expanse that couldn’t seem further from present day America and its digital society. This land in the Dakotas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming enters the public consciousness these days primarily as the setting for often-heated, fiercely partisan debates about oil fields and oil pipelines and agricultural practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Toby Jurovics notes in his essay in Moore’s book, for 150 years the push and pull between extractive industries, local economies and the natural environment has played out on these plains and in these hills. Others surely have a more nuanced understanding of this landscape than I do, but when I picture this part of the country, mostly I see plains and grasslands and little else. No drama, nothing awe-inspiring or great or even worth protecting if money can be made and jobs can be produced by exploiting it. Moore’s photographs show just how limited is my citified understanding of this landscape.</p>
<p>Through Moore’s eyes we see a herd of pronghorn sheep in a Wyoming grassland; the still, dark masses of hundreds of buffalo on a South Dakota ranch, the late afternoon sun revealing the shapes of rolling hills stretching out to the horizon. Eroded river banks, quarries and dilapidated frontier buildings—even lines of oil trains—are striking from Moore’s perspective. He also includes intimate portraits of local people, and details of places like small museums and shops, which balance and add context to his aerial photographs. Speaking of flying, Moore credits Doug Dean, the pilot who helped him create these images, on the title page of the book. He told Jurovics that Dean’s knowledge of the land and ability to fly low over the landscape helped define this work. “That perspective of being really right in the shot, in the landscape, creates a kind of an intimacy in the picture,” he notes.</p>
<p>As Kent Haruf points out in his preface to the book, this dirt meridian “may not be pretty, but it’s beautiful if you know how to look at it.” Moore does know how to look at it, and thanks to him, those of us who’ve seen his work will have an appreciation for the region’s complexity and diversity.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1XQs1KV">UNSEEN WATERLOO: THE CONFLICT REVISITED</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>By Sam Faulkner</strong></p>
<p><strong>Impress</strong></p>
<p><strong>240 pages, 104 photographs</strong></p>
<p><strong>$99</strong></p>
<p>Waterloo was where Napoleon famously went down to defeat in 1815 at the hands of the British. The battle changed the course of European history overnight, and ushered in Britain's proud era of 19th century imperialism, industrialism and Victorian rectitude.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Photographer <a href="http://www.samfaulkner.co.uk/">Sam Faulkner</a> grew up on a steady diet of that British glory, and is still fascinated by how war reverberates in the popular imagination. <em>Unseen Waterloo </em>is his contribution to the legend and narrative of that storied place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A former conflict photographer, Faulkner writes in the book's introduction that the project arose from his interest in "photographing something through its absence…<em><a href="http://amzn.to/1XQsfSf">Unseen Waterloo</a></em>…is about what isn't there. The carnage, blood and gore are absent. The mighty ferocity of the unbridled slaughter has passed….By focusing on the individuals rather than the scale of the battle, I hope to reframe Waterloo in more human terms."&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a portable studio, he went to Waterloo and made lush, moody portraits of battle re-enactors, all of whom are in character, and dressed in meticulously re-created military uniforms of the period. The officers put on upper class airs, while rank-and-file soldiers show the wear and tear of working class life. More than a few look as if they've recently awoken in a trench after a night of carousing. Faulkner avoids caricatures, and in a nod to the Old Masters, uses a black background and a touch of underexposure to dramatic effect, subduing the bright colors, baubles, and accoutrements of the uniforms, as well as the glint of the period weapons.</p>
<p>How authentic the portraits are is impossible to say. Photography wasn't invented in 1815, so contemporaneous photographs of actual Waterloo soldiers don't exist, and Faulkner is careful to emphasize that <em>Unseen Waterloo</em> is a work of historical fiction. But it is an artfully convincing—and compelling—re-imagination of the soldiers of Waterloo. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://fountainbooks.de/">LAND OHNE MITTE</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>By Anne Morgenstern</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fountain Books</strong></p>
<p><strong>220 pages</strong></p>
<p><strong>$50</strong></p>
<p>In 1991, a mob chased asylum seekers from Mozambique, Vietnam and Romania from the homes they had been assigned in the small East German town of Hoyerswerda. Instantly, the city became a symbol of xenophobia and racism in a newly united Germany. Fortunately, the incident remained isolated. But given the vast influx of refugees and migrants from places like Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea, and the Balkans in 2015 (Germany expects up to one million of them), it's possible the ghosts of nationalistic intolerance will be resurrected, if they have not been already. Eastern Germany is already seeing demonstrations in cities like Leipzig, decrying media bias, an influx of dangerous immigrants, etc. (which, to keep things in perspective, doesn't sound so different than their U.S. Tea Party equivalents.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first sight, photography might not be the best tool to engage with a place like Hoyerswerda. But what can be gained from using this tool is demonstrated by <a href="http://www.annemorgenstern.com/">Anne Morgenstern's</a> <em>Land ohne Mitte</em>, which documents present-day Hoyerswerda.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book contains none of the documentary photographs one might expect for such a subject. Instead, it quietly builds an atmosphere of a place that appears to have lost much of its hope. Mostly young people are depicted, plus a landscape not well taken care of. A sense of dread is palpable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Leipzig demonstrations didn’t arise out of a vacuum. A large segment of the Eastern German population feels disenfranchised, for real and imagined reasons. What is real is that vast areas in the east have become economic wastelands, resembling the American Rust Belt. It is unacceptable that the weakest of the weak, such as refugees from war-torn countries, become the target of derision and violence. At the same time, German society has to face the root causes of its xenophobia. <em>Land ohne Mitte</em> might just be the book that can help people see them.<span style="white-space: pre;" class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1XQsOvi">THE LONELY ONES</a>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>By <a href="http://www.guspowell.com/">Gus Powell</a>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>J&amp;L Books</strong></p>
<p><strong>96 pages, 40 color photographs</strong></p>
<p><strong>$47</strong></p>
<p><em>The Lonely Ones </em>has the size and heft of a small hymnal, at 5 inches wide and 7.5 inches tall. Its smooth, oatmeal-colored cloth cover gives the book a delicate, handmade feel. It comprises photographs contained within 40 gatefolds, and the work was inspired by and is named for the book <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1XQsYCX">The Lonely Ones</a></em> (1942) by the cartoonist William Steig. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Each image excluding the last is wrapped within a gatefold, and prefaced by an enigmatic caption. The sequence begins with “This will be our secret,” and each caption reads like a strange quotation from an unknown speaker. These captions hark back to the rhetorical form of cartoons, and evoke the playfulness that word and picture combinations entice from the imagination. They can be read from beginning to end like discarded pieces from a disassembled script. However, as each captioned page unfolds onto a photograph contained within a gatefold, miniature, individuated and uncanny narratives begin to take shape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Let’s not ruin it by talking” precedes a photograph of an elegantly dressed woman staring at a cart horse standing patiently on a city street. A picture of shadowy laborers erecting scaffolding against a luminous stack of office towers is prefaced by the line “Inquire within.” An image of a port-a-loo hung from a crane against blue sky follows the declaration that “Flattery gets me nowhere.”</p>
<p>Powell’s photographs are woven together in the memory with these miniature verbal fragments, and they suffuse his pictures with a sense of unwavering curiosity, wry wit and unalloyed reverie. His photographs are delicate, itinerant, at times balletic, and always unfalteringly specific in their affection for the flotsam and jetsam of everyday life.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1XQtjp7">DEADLINE</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>By Will Steacy, Tom Steacy &amp; current and former staff of The Philadelphia Inquirer</strong></p>
<p><strong>b.Frank Books</strong></p>
<p><strong>80 pages, illustrations throughout</strong></p>
<p><strong>$20</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://willsteacy.com/notebook/">Will Steacy</a> began <em>Deadline</em>, his long-term project documenting <em>The Philadelphia Inquirer’s</em> journey through the fire of a declining newspaper industry, in 2009. It wasn’t until earlier this year that Steacy was able to release an 80-page publication of his project. <em>Deadline</em> takes the form of a newspaper, with five sections that describe the paper’s past, present and future. Think about that: roughly six years to produce one newspaper. I don’t point this out to diminish Steacy’s work, which is remarkable and will no doubt become an important historical record of this pivotal period in the history of the news business. Yet when one thinks about what an undertaking it was to produce a single newspaper about a single business, one can’t help but also marvel at the human effort involved in producing a quality newspaper each and every day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In <em>Deadline</em>, Steacy’s photographs, archival images and fascinating, humorous, infuriating and heartbreaking articles written by current and former <em>Inquirer </em>staffers unfurl the history of the newspaper and its battle against decline. Steacy’s decision to create a history of&nbsp;<em>The Philadelphia Inquirer </em>was personal. His father was on the editorial staff, and his grandfather and great-grandfather were also newspapermen. In his acknowledgements, Steacy says he came to understand, through the <em>Inquirer</em>, that the newsroom is a family. And <em>Deadline</em> does read like a history of a once-great family fallen on hard times. Steacy’s images of stages in the paper’s move from its longtime offices include portraits of staffers soldiering on as their house crumbles around them, and an attention to little details that reveal volumes about the personalities that mixed together at the <em>Inquirer</em>. When in the fifth and final section of the paper we come across a double-truck of an emptied out newsroom with patterns on the carpet where the desks used to be, there’s an undeniable sense of loss, even outrage.</p>
<p>We as a society are currently in the process of replacing the thoughtful, determined labor of thousands of journalists with the shallow, half-hearted offerings of millions of people churning out content. Reading <em>Deadline</em>, it’s hard not to lament the diminishing newspaper business all over again. But the news isn’t all bad. The <em>Inquirer</em> is still there, as are many newspapers, in some form or another. <em>Inquirer</em> reporter Alfred Lubrano, in an article headlined “Skeleton staff fights off ghosts of the past,” acknowledges that today’s journalists can’t compete with the “geniuses of yesteryear” or the “halcyon days.” Now it’s a different game. Yet on a “random Tuesday,” he notes, one group of reporters were still “huddled over a story” that would alter the city’s tax code, while another group pulled together a “Pulitzer-prize winning series on the school district’s misdeeds…. I love this job, I love this place,” Lubrano says. The <em>Inquirer</em> family has “a chance to keep it going,” he argues. “It just might work.”<span style="white-space: pre;" class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></p>

<p><strong>Illustrations by Patrick Lynch</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aperture</strong></p>
<p><strong>156 pages, 79 color photos</strong></p>
<p><strong>$60</strong></p>
<p>In <em>My Last Day at Seventeen</em>, photographer <a href="http://dougdubois.com/">Doug DuBois</a> explores the emotional terrain of teenagers in an Irish public housing project, where the hopes and dreams of youth collide abruptly with the realities of adulthood. Does the world need another book about Ireland and its beleaguered people? Probably not. But this book stands out for its empathy, humor and subtlety.</p>
<p>DuBois started the project in 2009 during a month-long residency at the Sirius Arts Center in Cobh, and ended up staying for five years. Billed as a follow-up to his acclaimed 2009 book, <em>All the Days and Nights</em>, <em>My Last Day at Seventeen</em> mixes portraiture, found moments and “collaborative performances” with the subjects. Interspersed among the photographs are comic-strip vignettes, inspired by the subjects and actual events, by Dublin-based artist <a href="http://coastfieldguides.com/">Patrick Lynch</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The photographs penetrate the heart and soul of both people and place. The book includes no introduction or photo captions, although DuBois says in promotional materials that "everyone seems to be someone’s cousin, former girlfriend, or spouse. Little can happen there that isn’t seen, discussed, distorted beyond all reason, and fiercely defended against any disapprobation from the outside.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The photographs reflect the cohesion, the conflicts, and the frustrations over class and economic barriers, but you can tell this crowd has each other’s backs. And they obviously trust DuBois, who shows intimacy from close range. Younger kids play make-believe, and dissipate their excess energy and exuberance. But the weight of impending adulthood creeps into the faces of the older kids, and shows up in the subtle details and metaphors DuBois brings to bear: cuts and scrapes, a crashed car, unforgiving landscapes, a conflagration that seems about to consume the neighborhood—and three oblivious teens nearby.</p>
<p><em>My Last Day at Seventeen</em> is biting but optimistic, layered but accessible, and an all-around delight.<span style="white-space: pre;" class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[&nbsp;Photographer Michael Rubenstein was thrown 100 feet from his motorcycle three years ago, after an SUV T-boned him at an intersection. The accident broke all of his ribs on the right side, punctured a lung, and shattered his right leg, arm and shoulder. “I was in an ICU in Blatimore for three or four weeks, then they flew me to New York, where I was in the hospital for about another month,” Rubenstein says.<br />
<br />
Out of work for two years because of lingering neurological damage, Rubenstein exhausted his savings and then went “tens of thousands of dollars” into credit card debt, just to pay his basic living expenses. “I didn’t have disability insurance,” he says. “My mother had told me to get it. I said, ‘What do I need with long-term disability insurance? I'm fine. I'll be fine.’”<br />
<br />
He goes on to say that had he only taken his mother’s advice, “It would have made a huge difference. I would have had money to pay my rent, and for food, and bills.” <br />
<br />
Injuries or illnesses capable of putting you out of work for extended periods are more common than you might think. Twenty-year-olds have a 30 percent chance of becoming disabled for 90 days or longer before retirement, according to the Social Security Administration. And the average duration of disabilities doubles from about 2.5 years to about 5 years by retirement age, according to insurance industry statistics.<br />
<br />
The consequences of disability can be financially devastating. While medical insurance covers healthcare expenses, it won’t pay the mortgage and utilities or put food on the table while you are unable to work. That’s where disability insurance comes in, but most people, including photographers, aren’t adequately covered.<br />
<br />
“Any photographer who doesn’t have disability insurance is running a risk,” says Ray Taylor, CEO of Taylor &amp; Taylor, ASMP’s preferred disability insurance broker. “Several hundred photographers around the country are insured through us, and there’s always someone who gets in trouble.” <br />
<br />
Social Security, by the way, doesn’t provide much of a safety net. You have to be so severely disabled to collect Social Security that upwards of 80 percent of applicants are rejected. And even if you’re application is approved, payments max out at about $900 per month—hardly enough to cover the expenses of most people.<br />
<br />
For adequate coverage, you have to buy a private policy through a licensed insurance broker. Coverage options vary widely. “Buy as much disability insurance as you can get, and do it while you’re young and healthy,” advises Wealth Advisory Group managing director Aaron Schindler, who is the preferred disability insurance broker for American Photographic Artists (APA).<br />
<br />
How Much…and Who’s Eligible? <br />
<br />
Various web sites can help you figure out how much coverage you need (Google: “disability insurance calculator”). Costs vary, but it is pricey: expect to pay around 3 percent of your gross income for coverage. Eligibility depends upon various factors, including your age, your health, and your specialty. Generally, coverage is available to photographers 55 and younger who can prove they’re in good health, and whose photographic specialties don’t put them in harm’s way. But eligibility standards have become more stringent, as fewer and fewer companies continue to offer disability insurance. “You have to have a cleaner and cleaner health history” to get insured, Schindler says. <br />
<br />
When applying, you’ll be required first to disclose your medical history in detail. You may also be required to provide certain medical records. Some underwriters require blood and urine samples, and perhaps even an EKG depending upon your age, says Schindler.<br />
<br />
If you have pre-existing medical conditions, insurers may refuse coverage, or offer it with exclusions for any disabilities stemming from those pre-existing conditions. “Diabetes, heart disease and cancer are obvious bugaboos,” says Taylor, but also expect exclusions for back-related disabilities simply for having visited a chiropractor for “adjustments,” Schindler warns. And if you’re on anti-depressants, chances are you won’t get insurance at all, he adds. <br />
<br />
If you engage in activities such as sky diving, auto racing, SCUBA diving, or rock climbing, expect exclusions for those things. And, says Schindler, “The more physical your work, and the more you travel and encounter dangerous situations, the pricier the policy and the less likely you are [to get insurance].” <br />
<br />
Table top photographers have the easiest time getting insured. Photojournalists traveling to war zones are unlikely to find coverage at any price. Editorial photographers and location shooters may have to hunt around for a policy, because insurers have become more risk-averse, and some underwriters now offer insurance only to studio photographers, Schindler says.<br />
<br />
What To Look For<br />
<br />
The primary factors to consider when buying insurance are the so-called elimination period, how the policy defines disability, and the benefits provided in the event of a claim.<br />
<br />
The elimination period is the time lag between the onset of disability and the start of disability payments. It may be 30, 60, 90, 120 days or even longer, though the cost of a short elimination period can be prohibitive. A 90-day elimination period is typical. (Obviously, it’s important to have enough savings to cover your living expenses through the elimination period.)<br />
<br />
Insurers define disability in two ways. “Own occupation” policies pay out if you are too sick or injured to perform your duties as a photographer. “Any occupation” policies, by contrast, pay only if you are unable to do any job at all, whether it’s photographer or desk-bound clerk or anything else. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
“Nobody wants an ‘any occupation’ policy,” advises Schindler. “You have to be so screwed up [and therefore unable to do anything at all] to get it to kick in.” <br />
<br />
Monthly Payments: How Much?<br />
<br />
Monthly payouts in the event of a disability typically range from 40 to 65 percent of your income at the time you purchased the policy. Some underwriters impose maximums. Policies available to ASMP members through Taylor &amp; Taylor max out at $4,000 per month, for instance. (The reason underwriters don’t insure your entire income is to limit their exposure, and to give you incentive to go back to work as soon as you’re able.) <br />
<br />
One problem with the percentage-of-income formula is that self-employed photographers often use various accounting tricks to minimize their income on their IRS Form 1040. That reduces tax liability, but it also lowers the monthly disability payments you’re eligible for, because insurers look at your recent tax forms to determine your income. <br />
<br />
Another difficulty is that if you buy disability insurance when you’re young, your income is likely to be relatively low, so disability payments might be insufficient to cover your expenses if you become disabled in middle age. <br />
<br />
To compensate, you can buy an inflation rider, so your coverage rises with inflation. Another option is to buy a so-called future increase option (FIO), which allows you to increase your policy’s monthly payment provisions by up to 100 percent as your salary increases.<br />
<br />
“I advise people to buy the FIO because it’s cheaper than the inflation rider,” says Schindler.<br />
<br />
Payment Duration<br />
<br />
Besides the monthly payment provision, the other critical benefit to consider is the duration of payments in the event of a disability. Historically, the three common options were 5 years, to age 65, and lifetime. Unfortunately, though, lifetime policies are nearing extinction. Policies that provide “own occupation” insurance to age 65 are also becoming scarce.<br />
<br />
“Normally you’re insured for two, five or ten years at your own occupation, and then after that you’re covered only if you’re unable to perform work for which you’re reasonably suited by education, training, or experience,” says Taylor. For instance, if you’re in a wheelchair and can’t work as a photographer, your payments would stop if you were able to do things such as photo editing or teaching photography. And some underwriters are willing to help you transition into a suitable career by offering financial assistance for re-training, Taylor notes.<br />
<br />
Another way insurers limit their exposure and keep premiums affordable is by issuing policies that reduce benefit payments by the amount you may earn at another occupation, no matter what it is, according to Schindler. For instance, if you’re disabled as a photographer, but then start to earn money as a lawyer, your disability benefits will decrease accordingly. <br />
<br />
There’s no such thing as a “standard” policy, though. Underwriters all offer different options, at different prices, so it pays to shop around.<br />
<br />
Special Riders<br />
<br />
Worth mentioning are so called “partial” or “residual” disability riders (additions to a policy) that allow you to collect a portion of your monthly disability payments if you are able to work part time. Partial disability coverage may be useful, for instance, while you are transitioning back to work. Without partial disability protection, you’re disability payments end when you go back to work, even if aren’t able to earn your full income.<br />
<br />
Some insurers also offer social security riders, which reduce your monthly payments by the amount of Social Security disability you are able to collect, if any. A Social Security rider can save you money, but will reduce your monthly income if your disability is severe enough to qualify you for Social Security. “I recommend social security riders only to my most budget conscious customers,” says Schindler.<br />
<br />
Filing a Claim<br />
<br />
Insurers are obligated to pay claims when your physician declares you too injured or ill to perform the duties of your occupation. But some underwriters are more apt than others to contest claims, so it pays to inquire about the underwriter’s record for paying claims. <br />
<br />
Michigan photographer Jay Asquini, who could no longer work after shattering his spine in an accident in 2001, says he had to fight for months to get his insurance company to pay on his disability claim. Part of the problem was that the extent of Asquini’s cognitive disabilities weren’t immediately apparent, and he was in a Catch-22: he was too disabled, he says, to make the case that he was disabled.<br />
<br />
“If you need to make a claim, get someone—a forceful relative or a competent attorney—to make it for you,” he advises.<br />
<br />
But the most important thing, he says, is to live and work safely. “But accidents happen. I was lucky that I had insurance.”<br />
<br />
For his part, Michael Rubenstein says he’s rebuilding his career and can’t yet afford disability insurance. But as soon as his finances allow, he says, he’ll be shopping for a policy.<br />

    <article_text><![CDATA[<em>As more photographers move into motion and promote their skills as directors, they can sometimes find themselves pulled in two directions on assignments, when the client wants them to deliver great stills as well as high-quality video. According to veteran photographer-directors PDN spoke to, the first step in managing a combined production is to separate the shoots for stills from the shoot for the video—by carrying them out at different times or in slightly separate locations. To ensure a smooth workflow, photographer-directors also have to adjust their lighting, the planning of their shots, and their directions to their crews. In part one of this three-part series, </em><a href="http://www.daniellelevitt.com/" style="font-style: italic;">Danielle Levitt</a><em> breaks down the planning and production of recent still-video assignment for </em>I-D magazine<em>.</em>

<p><em></em></p>
<p>For photographer and director Danielle Levitt, shooting still photos is part of nearly every video production she does, whether or not the assignment brief calls for it. “I’m a photographer first and a filmmaker second. I love filmmaking, but my instinct is always to take pictures,” she says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When clients don’t give her a request and a budget to shoot stills, Levitt has to steal time for it—without compromising the video production, of course. She and her producer manage it by running tightly organized productions, working with a seasoned film crew, and setting up a portable studio adjacent to the film set, so Levitt can shoot stills at any spare moment.</p>
<p>“Flexibility is king. You have to figure out how to do both [still and video], and have your instincts be super sharp, so nothing gets compromised,” she says. “It requires a lot of energy and a lot of focus. You’re basically doing two jobs.”</p>
<p>Last year, for instance, she produced <a href="http://www.daniellelevitt.com/galleries/491-i_D_TRIBES_BMX_">a series of three videos called Tribes for</a> <em><a href="http://www.daniellelevitt.com/galleries/491-i_D_TRIBES_BMX_">i-D Magazine</a></em>. Sponsored by Marc Jacobs, each video featured a different youthful “tribe,” including a rockabilly crowd, a group of thrashcore musicians, and a group of BMX riders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The client hired Levitt for video only, but she also delivered stills at no extra charge because she found the subjects so compelling.</p>
<p>“I love what I do and I know there’s value in it, but I just wanted to give. I can’t say I always do, or always will,” she says.</p>
<p>She shot the videos in a loose documentary style, pre-interviewing the subjects about the places they hang out, and the things they do. She then created storyboards for various shots around locations where she could prompt and then shoot authentic action. She says, “When we get to a location where we are there long enough, I set up my studio kit”—a white seamless backdrop and a few lights. She also has at least one photo assistant and tech on stand-by, just to help with the still shooting.</p>
<p>For the rockabilly video, she had the portable studio set up in a parking lot near the last location of the day. Because the rockabilly “tribe” is nocturnal, the production went well past midnight. Levitt started pulling her subjects into the studio for quick portraits as the film crew was wrapping up. By that time, she had spent 17 hours with them. “I knew them, they were warmed up, and you have that dynamic [of rapport] you want for stills, because you have only a moment to capture it,” she says.</p>
<p>The BMX production, which involved stylishly dressed youth riding BMX bikes through city streets, took place during the day. On that shoot, Levitt also pulled subjects into her portable studio for quick portraits. In addition, she wandered around the film set all day with camera in hand, giving the talent a few quick directions for on-the-spot still images, and grabbing “beauty images,” says Stephanie Porto, who has been Levitt’s full-time producer for the past five years.</p>
<p>Levitt says she’s often shot a few stills while her film crew is occupied with its preparations, such as laying dolly tracks, changing camera lenses, or adjusting lights. That’s how she grabbed still photos on <a href="http://www.daniellelevitt.com/galleries/579-smoke_x_mirrors_listen_to_the_kids">a recent production for Smoke x Mirrors Eyewear</a>. Levitt says her photo assistant had set up her portable studio on that shoot, “but the wind came along and knocked it over, and we didn’t have time to set it up again.”</p>
<p>For every production, Levitt and Porto allot a specific amount of shoot time for each scene on the video storyboard. To meet the schedule, “you staff up” as much as the budget allows, Levitt says. Her sets include a director of photography—she often works with <a href="http://www.david-raboy.com/">David Raboy</a>—camera assistants, grips, and gaffers—enough people to break down and set up quickly between one location and the next. (If she has a budget for still photography, she’ll bring as many as three assistants just for that, and sometimes schedule a day just for a photo shoot.)</p>
<p>On set, Porto minds the clock, and gets the crew to step up the pace if production is falling behind. “That’s the hardest part: making sure the film doesn’t take more time than you have,” Levitt says. The shoots are also organized so she has to spend little or no time between scenes giving directions to the crew, leaving her a few minutes to shoot instead. For instance, crew members are briefed in the morning, given a printed schedule, and during each scene, the upcoming scenes are announced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Occasionally Levitt is able to shoots stills while Raboy, her DP, is shooting a video scene. They’ve worked together on a number of productions, so he knows what Levitt expects, and she trusts him. “When he’s shooting [a scene with] someone over here, I can shoot [stills of] someone else over there, because I know he’s got that. We’ve mapped it out. He’s running it, so I’ll go take that picture on the side.”</p>
<p>Levitt says she has no difficulty switching mental gears from video to stills, because shooting stills has become instinctual for her. The real challenge is carving out time for both. “You have to be really organized, you have to know what you want, and you have to have a strong team in place.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[For creative services agency and production company <a href="http://www.goodrichvisions.com/">Goodrich Visions,</a> an assignment to produce portraits of more than 2,000 attorneys for a global law firm was a logistical tour de force. “It was the biggest project our little firm has taken on, and it could have come apart at the seams any time,” says principal Matthew Goodrich.
<p>The law firm was re-branding, and wanted to update its website with clean, visually consistent portraits of all its partners and associates. Goodrich had previously worked with the firm’s global director of creative services. “When it came down to the comparison between multiple vendors I felt confident to go with the team I already knew and trusted,” she says.</p>
<p>The brief called for black-and-white portraits set against a background of the city where each attorney works. (The firm has offices in 39 countries.) Goodrich, who was the executive producer of the project, says it took months to work out details, estimate the costs, and nail down a contract. “It came down to how we would handle the production process in each city.” The plan was to use local photographers—they ultimately hired 34 of them around the world?—so getting a consistent look across so many sets and subjects remained a big challenge. </p>
<p>Goodrich’s wife, <a href="http://www.tamigoodrich.com/about">Tami Goodrich</a>, served as the project’s creative director. With more than 20 years of experience as a photo art director for fashion and outdoor lifestyle retailers, she oversaw all the art direction and styling. The third member of the team was <a href="http://www.robertstaley.com/">Robert Staley</a>, a Los Angeles-based commercial lifestyle and catalogue photographer.    </p>
<p>Originally, they planned to scout locations near the firm’s offices and shoot outdoors. Figuring out the logistics for that plan took three months. But when the firm learned that its attorneys would be away from their desks for 45 minutes each, plans to shoot outdoors were scrapped because the loss of billable hours revenue was too steep.</p>
<p>So Goodrich Visions figured out how to set up studios inside the firm’s offices, and rely on a retoucher to make the portraits look like they had been shot outside. Besides being able to move attorneys through indoor sets twice as fast, Goodrich Visions didn’t have to worry about variables such as unpredictable light and weather. </p>
<p>“We needed to simulate an outdoor shoot, so we created a lighting diagram for all the photographers to follow with a rim light off to the side, to make it seem like the sun was shining over [the subject’s] shoulder,” Goodrich explains.</p>
<p>They did a test run at the Los Angeles office of the firm. “We worked through some of the kinks, and figured out efficiencies that could be put in place,” Goodrich says. For instance, they figured out exactly how much time the photographer needed with each subject (20 to 30 minutes) and the minimum crew—photographer, photo assistant and groomer—required to make the set run smoothly. The pilot shoot also included a post-production test for three different companies bidding for the retouching work. </p>
<p>On the basis of the LA shoot, Goodrich Visions came up with a detailed styling and technical guide that ran more than 20 pages. It served as template that other photographers hired for the job had to follow. It included an equipment list, a lighting schematic, and instructions on where to place the tripod and camera for the proper scaling. It included directions for styling and posing subjects, and included sample photographs with the words “I want this” or “I do not want this” written next to them, Tami Goodrich says.</p>
<p>“Some photographers wanted to put their spin on it, but I didn’t want them to put their spin on it. I wanted them to follow [the guidelines] to the letter,” she says.</p>
<p>Goodrich Visions also used the LA shoot as the basis for an estimate for the entire job. The contract for the job ran 20 pages, and took a month to hammer out.</p>
<p>Staley and Tami Goodrich worked as a team to shoot the portraits in all the U.S. offices of the firm. In New York City, they had two sets going simultaneously, and shot 40 attorneys per day. With photographers hired to shoot portraits at offices outside the U.S., they had pre-production Skype calls to make sure everyone understood the details. They scheduled the first overseas shoots in smaller offices of the firm in order to further test and tweak the production procedures.</p>
<p>The hired photographers were required to scout the offices before the shoot day. “We had follow-up calls once they did the scout,” to head off potential problems, Matthew Goodrich says. Photographers were also required to send test shots of their assistants before they started photographing the attorneys, to make sure the lighting and camera positioning were correct.</p>
<p>Goodrich says he and his team were on call 24/7 throughout production, in order to check the work while photographers were still on set, and to trouble shoot on the fly. “By the time we were half way through, we had it dialed. We learned a ton.”</p>
<p>In all, there were 130 shoot days over a period of six months. Working with project managers in each of the firm’s offices, Goodrich managed all the shoot day scheduling. For that task, he used Sales Force, a project management platform. “At any time, I knew where each [attorney] was in the process. I could track everything through post production and delivery,” he says.</p>
<p>The photographers shot a total of 59,000 images, or 25 to 30 frames per subject. By contract stipulation, each attorney had final approval over his or her portrait. Goodrich says that stipulation added another two months to the project.</p>
<p>Tami Goodrich edited the frames of each subject down to seven frames. “We used a star system to rate the selections,” and help subjects make the final image selection, she explains. Once subjects made their selection, it went to the retoucher to be recomposed as if it had been shot outside, rather than in a conference room.</p>
<p>The firm’s director of creative services praises Goodrich Visions for being “organized, trustworthy and low maintenance. Issues were handled before I even knew they existed, which is the best type of vendor to partner with.”</p>
<p>Now that the job is finished, “it will be much easier for us to deconstruct [similar] projects, and streamline operations” for other global firms, Goodrich says. “If we were approached by another corporation with 10, 15 or 20 offices, we would have no trouble stacking [the shoots] to minimize delivery time.” The company has no such assignments pending, but Goodrich says he’s pursuing several leads.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[The term “archival impulse,” first coined by the art historian Hal Foster in an essay in the Fall 2004 edition of the art journal <em>October</em>, can be applied to any artist who mines documents and objects from the past in order to transform “excavation sites” into “construction sites”—or, in other words, to create a more balanced and fair-minded history from a biased past. In her series <a href="http://www.ayanavjackson.com/#!archival-impulse/c10by">“Archival Impulse,”</a> photographer <a href="http://www.ayanavjackson.com/">Ayana V. Jackson</a>, who splits her time between Paris, New York and Johannesburg, is concerned with reconstructing the history of black bodies as captured by white photographers and photojournalists throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. “I’m reclaiming the legacy of those images,” she says. “I’m attaching new meaning to them.” 
<p>In the series, which was on view at <a href="http://marianeibrahim.com/">Mariane Ibrahim Gallery</a> in Seattle this fall, along with a related series, <a href="http://www.ayanavjackson.com/#!poverty-pornography/c17sf">“Poverty Pornography,”</a> Jackson recreates images of nude African women, starving children and colonial servants she culled from sources such as “Human Zoo: Invention of the Savage,” an exhibition she saw at Paris’s Quai Branly museum in 2011; and the Duggan-Cronin archive in Johannesburg, an extensive collection of photographs of migrant workers and “natives” in South Africa taken by an Irishman who worked for the DeBeers diamond company at the beginning of the twentieth century. She uses herself as the subject, taking self-portraits in her studio using natural light and the timer on her camera. To adjust her poses to match the original subjects, she reviews the images sent from her camera to her computer in between takes. To make group shots, she clones images of her body in Photoshop and collages them over backgrounds—often these are travel landscape shots she took in Rwanda, Kenya, Mexico, Morocco and Paris. She describes her work as performance rather than portrait-making. About her decision to use only her own body, she explains. “I want to draw attention to the content rather than the individual.” Also, she fears that if she worked with models, she would be re-creating exactly what she is critiquing: the exploitation of another person’s body for social commentary.   </p>
<p>Jackson, who received her B.A. in sociology from Spelman College in Atlanta in 1999, and took courses in photography at the University of Art in Berlin in 2005, creates strange, uncanny images that jar the viewer. In “Devotees and Demons (2012),” for example, she stands in the center of the frame—wearing the white dress and straw hat of a Victorian-era missionary—at the surreal apex of a pyramid of dozens of nude self-portraits. The original image is of Alice Seeley Harris, the English missionary and documentary photographer, standing amongst a group of semi-nude schoolchildren in the Congo in the 1890s. Seely’s image was intended to shed light on the horrors of slavery in the Congo under King Leopold II of Belgium. Though it was intended to raise awareness, it operates within the colonial lexicon of “otherness.” Harris is not one of the children—in her pure white dress, at the top of the mound, she is, on many levels, symbolically dominating them.</p>
<p>“What is the Alice Seeley Harris photograph telling you?” Jackson asks over the phone from her studio in Johannesburg. “This was one of the first images a European may have ever seen of an African body. Look at how the missionary is clothed, and the ‘savages’ are unclothed.” She pauses. “Now, look at my image, and tell me, who is civilized, and who is savage?”</p>
<p>Jackson’s point that black bodies in photographs have historically been relegated to the realm of “savage”—and in turn, “sexual,” “pitiable,” and “primitive”—comes across strongly, and evokes outrage. The effect is similar in “Dis Ease (2011),” in which Jackson recreates Kevin Carter’s famous 1993 image of a vulture watching over a starving child in southern Sudan, using her nude body in the positions of both the bird of prey and the preyed upon; and “Diorama I (2012),” which shows the artist assuming the position of a white-bearded anthropologist, as well as the nude Andaman children he is studying, from a photograph taken in 1869. </p>
<p>In Jackson’s images, there are no “others”—there is just the artist, and the discomfort in seeing a black woman pose in a manner that, even today, could be considered exploitative. </p>
<p>The power of Jackson’s images lies in that point of discomfort. She refuses to let the visual legacy of racism, slavery and oppression remain in the past. This commitment is especially important in her adopted homeland of South Africa, where she has kept a studio since 2007. “In South Africa, there is a rising generation that for the first time is experiencing freedom,” she said. “When I look at them, I see that they are like my father’s generation in the United States—he was born in 1951. He had to participate in the Civil Rights movement. A lot of people are fighting for that here now.</p>
<p>“I’m watching a place become itself," she adds. "There’s a need for someone to deconstruct the stereotypes and misunderstandings. A need not only in South Africa, but also around the world. We are still trying to understand the original sin of racism.”</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[In a competitive marketplace, many factors influence why a client or ad agency chooses a photographer for an assignment. We rounded up advice from photographers, reps and an art buyer about how to handle the bidding and estimating process, and how to effectively present your ideas to a client. You’ll find more advice about writing treatments, showing storyboards, and putting your best face forward during creative calls this month on PDNOnline.
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/Bidding-and-Landing--10358.shtml">Bidding and Landing Ad Assignments: An Art Producer’s Perspective</a> </strong></p>
<p>Amy Salzman, who works as a freelance senior integrated art producer, says the triple bid is a useful process that can help clients understand what the production they want demands. She also notes that it’s not always the lowest bid that lands the job. “It depends on what the difference is between the high, middle and low bids. It also depends on which photographer you think is best for the job. Do low bids tend to look better?  Absolutely. But do they always get the job? Not necessarily.” If she or the creatives like one photographer’s ideas, she says, “I’m not going to tell a photographer how to produce the job but if there’s someone we really want to work with, but they’re way out of the range, I’ll say, ‘We really want to work with you, but you’re way out of the range,’ and let them re-try.”</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/10-Questions-to-Ask--1054.shtml">10 Questions to Ask Before You Bid on an Ad Assignment</a></strong></p>
<p>Listening carefully during the creative call with a campaign art director and during pre-estimate calls with the agency’s art buyer is essential to creating a successful bid. After hearing what the creative director wants, the photographer or producer can follow up with questions—about scheduling, logistics, budget limitations—with the art buyer. That’s when it’s important to get detailed information about the size and scale of the project in order to complete a realistic estimate. It can be helpful to have a list of questions written before the call. While every shoot is different, reps and producers who talked to <em>PDN</em> said there are certain questions they always have to ask. </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/Making-Videos-Client-12085.shtml">Making Videos Clients Will Love With Budgets You Don’t</a> </strong></p>
<p>One of the challenges of shooting motion is squaring clients’ high expectations for production value with their tight budgets. Many clients still see motion as an add-on to a still shoot, with little understanding of what motion production requires. “We hear over and over that motion is secondary,” says photographer <a href="http://www.jimhughesphoto.com/">Jim Hughes</a>. “I tell them, ‘If you want A-level production, here’s what you’re going to need.’ I hold the integrity of pricing,” he says. Photographer-directors <em>PDN</em> interviewed discussed their make-or-break budget requirements. For <a href="http://www.stephanierausser.com/">Stephanie Rausser</a>, it’s money to hire a DP. For producer Jesse Scolaro of <a href="http://thebendcreative.com/index.html">Bend Creative</a>, it’s a digital tech to manage media, secure files and check camera cards.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/James-Worrell-Sketc-7430.shtml">James Worrell: Sketching Concepts for Editorial Clients to Gain the Attention of Ad Agencies</a></strong></p>
<p>Photographers have to find a way to show the ad agency (or the client) that they understand what the brand is looking for. Different photographers <em>PDN </em>interviewed have different approaches to this. “Once I get someone interested in a particular project, I offer to make them sketches of my ideas to add to their ideas—because everyone usually has a rough idea of what they want to do. And if they are a first-time client, they might not know that I like to brainstorm and expound upon an idea,” says <a href="http://www.jamesworrell.net/">James Worrell</a>, who also creates specialized booklets of specific types of images he’s done. </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/Joey-and-Jessica-Us-7406.shtml">Joey and Jessica: Using Personal Work and Mood Boards to Get Clients Excited About Their Vision</a></strong></p>
<p>The lifestyle photography duo of <a href="http://www.joeyseawell.com/">Joey and Jessica</a> (aka Joey and Jessica Seawell) create a mood board for almost every advertising bid they are asked to submit. “We really look at having a strong, creative, visual foundation,” the North Carolina-based photographers say. Once they get into the triple bid phase they’ll put a PDF together, which usually contains a more fleshed-out, color version of the sketch; the bid and cover letter; what their approach to the campaign would be, including possible locations, photos of models and wardrobe they would like to use; an explanation of how they’ll approach the shoot; and why they’re excited about the campaign. That PDF “becomes the whole backbone [of the shoot], the booklet that we would have on set that the stylist, the producer and everyone would have,” they explain.  </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/Diana-King-Showing-7481.shtml">Diana King: Showing Style, Illustrating Her Estimates</a></strong></p>
<p>When a client called fashion photographer <a href="http://www.diana-king.com/">Diana King</a> about a holiday campaign, she listened to the initial idea, and realized the budget wouldn’t be enough to cover location shoots and permits. To suggest a more cost-effective alternative, she used a mood board to show how she would present the “hip, artistic” feel that the client had told King he wanted, while using one lighting setup and one indoor location. She adds that in talking to the art director, “I listen for the buzzwords of how they want to show off their brand and who they want to sell to.”  </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/Video-Production-101-7487.shtml">Video Production 101: How to Estimate the Cost and Fees</a></strong></p>
<p>We asked two photographers to break down, line by line, the estimates they submitted for video projects for advertising clients. One estimated for a combined still-video shoot for a local health industry client—who changed the scope and size of the production after selecting the winning bid. The second shot a Web video for a national brand in the food industry. </p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[In Eastern Romania, young women are now conspicuously absent from many towns and villages. “Nobody talks about it. It’s like a huge elephant in the room,” says photographer <a href="http://www.andreabruce.com/">Andrea Bruce</a>. But she’s determined to talk about it: Her recent story called <a href="http://projects.aljazeera.com/2015/08/sex-trafficking-in-romania/index.html?utm_content=nobylines">“Romania’s Disappearing Girls”</a> explores how a mixture of poverty, shame, and corruption has enabled sex traffickers to lure so many women into slavery.
<p><a href="http://projects.aljazeera.com/2015/08/sex-trafficking-in-romania/index.html?utm_content=nobylines">Published online by Al Jazeera America in August</a>, Bruce’s photographs capture a sense of foreboding and shame in the quiet, picturesque Romanian villages, and emptiness and despair in the streets of Bucharest, where many victims end up trapped behind locked doors. She also reported and wrote the accompanying story. </p>
<p>Sex trafficking is a global problem, but journalists often sensationalize the story by focusing on sex clubs and female victims going through the motions, says Vaughn Wallace, deputy photo editor at Al Jazeera America. “Andrea’s work is humanizing. She was really interested in photographing these young women to explain to a larger audience [what] they’re facing.”</p>
<p>Bruce spent more than a decade covering the effects of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, and has lately turned her attention to other stories. She began work on sex trafficking after her agency, <a href="http://noorimages.com/">NOOR</a>, got grants from Lexis/Nexis and Nikon to produce a group project about modern-day slavery.</p>
<p>Researching the subject, Bruce came across the work of Benjamin Skinner, who wrote about sex trafficking in Romania in his book <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1MWcReS">A Crime So Monstrous</a></em>. It caught her interest because of Romania’s status as an EU country and a gateway for immigrants heading to Europe. Bucharest has also become an epicenter of sex tourism that Romanian and European Union officials seem uninterested in acknowledging, much less shutting down.</p>
<p>Bruce went to Romania with “a long list of things I could cover in different ways.” It included visiting the villages, seeking out victims by hanging out on the streets of Bucharest with staffers from NGOs who pass out clean needles and condoms to prostitutes, talking to police, visiting strip clubs and massage parlors, and approaching known traffickers.</p>
<p>Skinner introduced Bruce to some local journalists who have been investigating the story. Among them was a young female journalist Bruce hired as a fixer, to help navigate the bureaucracy, write letters of inquiry and serve as a translator.</p>
<p>“Every aspect of the story was so hard. Even taking pictures in villages is difficult,” Bruce says. Because public officials were mostly uncooperative, she had to report around them. “The people who would talk about it all gave me a clear idea of how [the sex trafficking] works. But it never happened in front of me,” Bruce says. “There’s nothing I can prove on paper. It’s really frustrating.” </p>
<p>They found a few anti-trafficking police officers who were willing to explain how traffickers worked. (Those street-level officers also said they were under-funded and ignored by higher-ups.) In search of traffickers to interview, Bruce and her fixer sent letters to prisons all over Romania. They finally found one trafficker who was willing to talk and be photographed. “In his mind, he didn’t do anything wrong,” Bruce says. “Traffickers think that if it weren’t for them, these girls would just starve in the countryside.” </p>
<p>They also asked owners of more than two dozen strip clubs for permission to photograph. One finally said yes. “He was proud that his business was doing really well, and he insisted that there was no trafficking happening there,” Bruce says. But none of the girls they met would talk about their past, or say whether they were under the control of a trafficker.</p>
<p>“My fixer and I came to the conclusion that if they had access to their own Facebook [account], they weren’t being trafficked,” Bruce says. By that standard, Bruce suspects many of the girls she met in clubs were trafficking victims, not prostitutes. </p>
<p>Traveling to the villages where many victims came from, Bruce and her fixer approached people working in fields. They talked to bartenders, school teachers—anyone they could find. Most who were willing to talk at all were in denial about the sex trafficking. “The villages are very religious, and very conservative,” Bruce says, but adds: “You find out the truth after you dig and dig and dig.”</p>
<p>In one village, Bruce was able to photograph a teenager whose mother turned her to prostitution. That teenager was determined not to fall into the hands of sex traffickers. The photographs show her at home, preparing to go to work, but also show, through details in and around her family’s house, what her life is like. “The details encourage the viewer to recognize the dignity of the subject she’s photographing,” Wallace observes.</p>
<p>In the accompanying story, Bruce explains that traffickers lure the girls by professing love, wooing them with gifts and promising a better life elsewhere. The girls often fall for the ruse. They quickly end up turning tricks out of a sense of loyalty and obligation, then find themselves trapped financially and physically in Bucharest, too ashamed to return home. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, their families also feel shame and guilt. “They don’t want the neighbors to know, so they don’t talk about it. The girls just disappear,” Bruce says.</p>
<p>She worked tirelessly to find the anonymous apartments around Bucharest where enslaved girls live and are forced to work. But she ran out of money—and time—before she was able to gain access to those places.</p>
<p>By then she had made two trips to Romania, spending a total of four and a half months on the project. Hoping to find a media organization willing to fund another trip, Bruce started pitching the story. The European publishers she approached weren’t interested. Sex trafficking is underreported, Bruce says, but people often confuse it with prostitution, which has been getting a lot of coverage in Europe. </p>
<p>But Al Jazeera America is always looking for issue-driven stories “centered on people whose voices are not as amplified as they should be,” Wallace says. Bruce’s ability to write a story to go with the photographs helped get support for publication from Al Jazeera America’s features editor and editor-in-chief.</p>
<p>Bruce says she’s still hoping to go back to Bucharest to interview more traffickers, accompany police on raids, and spend more time in the streets trying to meet people involved in organized crime and prostitution. For now, she has put the project on the back burner, while she works on other assignments, and looks for funding and new leads to resume her work in Romania.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Photographer <a href="http://www.keatleyphoto.com/">John Keatley</a>, interviewed in <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/How-to-Make-the-Most-of-a-Creative-Call-and-Write-a-Successful-Treatment-15021.shtml">“How to Make the Most of a Creative Call and Write a Successful Treatment,"</a> is one of many photographers who generously provided business advice in our “How-to” issue. 
<p>He has been inspired to share his knowledge of estimating, brand building, licensing and marketing in seminars at PhotoPlus Expo and the Survival Guide weekend workshops he holds around the country because, when he needed it, New York City photographer <a href="http://www.chrisbuck.com/">Chris Buck</a> gave him help writing an estimate. “He saved my career in a way, and he gave me lessons I’ll never forget,” Keatley says.</p>
<p>In 2009, Keatley, who is based in Seattle, got a call to shoot the cover portrait for former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin’s memoir, which was to be published by HarperCollins. “At the time, my experience was in shooting corporate or editorial work,” Keatley says, and he had no framework for estimating a big production. His business had been slow following the financial collapse of 2008, he says. “I was just excited to take pictures. I hadn’t really thought long term, or about building a foundation.” For the Palin shoot, he submitted an estimate for some forseeable expenses and a creative fee that was fine for editorial work, but low for creating an image to be used in national advertising. Then plans for the Palin shoot and the use of his images “just kept growing,” he says, and he knew “I was leaving money on the table” with the estimate he had submitted. The art director gave Keatley a break: He told the photographer to raise his creative fee, and revise his estimate to reflect added expenses. </p>
<p>Feeling overwhelmed, Keatley called Buck, whom he had met only once. Like Keatley, Buck had started out as an editorial portrait photographer, but had produced his own shoots and, by 2009, had bid on and won many advertising assignments. Buck recalls, “He asked, ‘Can you help?’ and I said, ‘Sure.’” Keatley says of Buck, “He spent several hours on the phone with me. He was helping me on that specific job but he was really teaching me how to bid, and giving me real-world numbers.” </p>
<p>Buck walked Keatley through every line item, including travel days, taxis and the cost of getting equipment to Palin’s home in Alaska. Keatley recalls Buck noting, “If you’re taking a celebrity outside you should really have a motor home and security.”  By the end of the call, Keatley says, his original estimate of $25,000 had grown to $95,000, “and I said, ‘Chris, I’m not going to get this job.’” Buck recalls, “My answer to that would be, ‘You don’t want to do this job for less than that, because you’ll lose money.’” </p>
<p>Helping Keatley “seemed like a reasonable thing to do,” Buck tells <em>PDN</em>. When he was a new photographer in Toronto, veterans like <a href="http://www.briansmale.com/">Brian Smale</a> and <a href="http://www.deborahsamuel.com/">Deborah Samuel</a> answered his questions. These days, Buck says, he’ll give feedback to any photographer who asks him specific questions, as long as the photographer “seems serious.” He adds that Keatley sent Buck and his wife a gift certificate to one of New York City’s most acclaimed restaurants. Buck says, “He was thoughtful enough to remember and give back.”</p>
<p>Keatley says that at his <a href="http://keatleyphoto.com/survival-guide/">Survival Guide workshops</a>, he meets many photographers who are in similar situations to the one he was in when he called on Buck: “The difference between thriving and going out of business is sometimes really simple pieces of advice.” Buck says he now asks advice of Keatley and other photographers he’s helped through the years. Buck says, “You succeed by being humble and recognizing that you can learn from other people, who may be younger than you and also smart.” </p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Why is it that some places feel different than others? Are we simply reacting to what we see and hear around us? Or does the space—the air—carry something we can’t detect, something we don’t even think to search for? In his new book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Caleb-Cain-Marcus-Richard-Ford/dp/8862084188">Goddess</a></em>, published this fall by Damiani, <a href="http://www.calebcainmarcus.com/">Caleb Cain Marcus</a> uses photography to question how we experience space and color, and how both the seen and unseen may influence our lives.
<p>To create his images, Marcus spent 44 days in India, from December 2013 to January 2014, collecting material, traveling the length of the Ganges River from its origin in the Himalayas to its mouth in the Bay of Bengal in Bangladesh. He then spent more than a year working to create the final prints for his series, sometimes producing as many as 20 proofs as he adjusted the color and contrast of his images in small increments. The resulting images are hazy, full of muted hues and small, sometimes subtle hints of color—the green of patches of grass in an otherwise muddy field, or the vibrant clothing of hundreds of people gathered on the tan and gray bank of the muddy river.</p>
<p>Marcus’s fascination with India began at an early age, hearing his parents’ stories about the country as “a magical place,” he recalls. He’d visited India before, but when he began following the Ganges, it was the first time he chose to work there. His impression of India as a spiritual, mystical country where many believe “there’s something beyond what we can prove scientifically,” made it seem like the ideal place to continue the investigations of space and color that he’s carried through his projects, which include <em><a href="http://www.calebcainmarcus.com/a-portrait-of-ice-1">A Portrait of Ice,</a></em> a series of photographs of glaciers. </p>
<p>Marcus chose to follow the Ganges River because he “needed a path” through the large, diverse country, and because of its central role in the Hindu religion as a physical manifestation of the goddess Ganga. </p>
<p>But Marcus wasn’t interested in a literal representation of the river or the landscapes and people that surround it. “I’m interested in the potential way that space can be experienced,” he explains. “So the photography is a way both for me personally to explore that, but also hopefully that other people become maybe more aware or sensitive. It’s a way of sharing another possibility of the way to experience space.”</p>
<p>We don’t often think of air as something we can see, unless it’s carrying pollutants. But Marcus wants the haze in his photographs to encourage us to consider air’s “substance and weight. It has a quality and texture to it that can transmit some kind of data,” he says. For instance, when we enter a space after something has taken place, there is “some kind of residue” left after the event. “I don’t know how long it lasts. But we walk into a church—and I don’t have any particular religion that I follow—but some churches, the space is very different. And I think we can all usually feel it in many of these spectacular churches in the world. You walk into Notre Dame and there’s something about the space which is different. The air is not the same outside of the church walls. I think that’s an area where its very evident, but I think everywhere, space is almost a living entity that we disregard often.”</p>
<p>In this work, Marcus’s printing process was central to his effort to visualize space in a way that alters our awareness of it. “The print: that’s the work,” he says. “Whatever that is, that’s the final product. That’s where the time is spent, working to craft and create the vision and the emotional resonance that you want, or that you hope that someone is going to get through the print.”</p>
<p>By repeatedly outputting proofs and tweaking the color and contrast in the images digitally, Marcus realized a visual consistency throughout the body of work. This consistency across photographs—that were presumably made in locations that looked very different from one another—suggests something shared along the length of the river.  Marcus writes in his “Project Notes,” which are included in the book, “The entire length of Ganga is believed sacred. Perhaps this belief has caused space to accumulate and become more present and more definite, or perhaps Ganga is sacred because the physicality of space has always been present along her banks. Perhaps this is what has drawn people to her for millennia. Either way, her essence and that of the people lured to her banks have mixed to form a type of space that is visceral, almost visible to the naked eye.”</p>
<p>It’s interesting to consider how the residue of history and belief, perhaps borne by the air that flows around places like the Ganges River, may help define peoples’ experience. Through his images, Marcus encourages us to consider the space around us more closely. “I don’t know if we can see the space normally, but I think that we can definitely feel or interact with the space, and recognize different types of space that exist,” Marcus posits. “I would like to hopefully display a different sense of space than what we normally see and interact with.”</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/11-gear-ROUNDUP-VSCO-Android-a.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>VSCO Cam </strong></p>
<p>In late July, VSCO updated its popular Cam app (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/vsco-cam/id588013838?ls=1&amp;mt=8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vsco.cam&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Dcorporate%26utm_medium%3Dcorpweb">Android</a>) with a new feature dubbed Collections, a curation tool that lets you save and share other VSCO images you discover on the service. Whenever an image is shared in a collection, the original creator is notified. The Android version of Cam now supports split focus and exposure when taking a photo, plus a modify, undo or view all option in its new editing history feature. If you have a favorite set of edits, you can copy and paste them across multiple photos. VSCO Cam’s photographic features are complemented with a social networking component dubbed Grid, where curated images are displayed for all to admire. Unlike rival services, you won’t see likes, follower counts, comments or any other hierarchical baggage in Grid on the premise that, as VSCO puts it, beautiful imagery trumps social clout.” </p>
<p><strong>PRICE:</strong> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/vsco-cam/id588013838?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Free</a></p>

<p><strong>Morpholio Journal</strong></p>
<p>It’s not exactly fair to pigeonhole <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/morpholio-journal-write-sketch/id997484300?mt=8">Morpholio’s new Journal iOS app</a> as a mere photo app (not that there’s anything wrong with those). Instead, it’s a multi-purpose menagerie housing your hand-drawn sketches, photos, drawings, notes and more. In the app, you can draw directly on images imported from your camera roll with eight pens, brushes and pencil styles to choose from using 16 color palettes. You can also append short notes to images. The app arranges your content in a book-style interface with page turning that can transition from leisurely flip to rapid-fire scroll under the guidance of your finger. These virtual journals can be hundreds of pages in length, so you’ll appreciate the blazing fast page turning as the page count grows. You can also build collages that combine photos, drawings, sketches and notes.</p>

<p><strong>Filmic Pro</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/filmic-pro/id436577167?mt=8">Filmic Pro</a> has the unique distinction of powering one of the most ambitious iPhone feature films to date: Sean Baker’s Tangerine (<a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/Sundance-Favorite-Tangerine-is-a-Feature-Film-Shot-on-iPhones-14018.shtml">profiled in “Frames per Second,” in the July 2015 issue</a>). As Baker told us, it would have been impossible to shoot Tangerine on an iPhone without the app. Think of Filmic Pro as Manual for video. The app enables iPhones to record up to 2K video on an iPhone 5 or higher with full manual control over focus, exposure, ISO, shutter speed, tint and color temperature. You’ll enjoy a range of audio monitoring tools, audio gain control and framing guides that support common cinema aspect ratios such as Super35mm, Super16mm and cinemascope. Settings can be saved as presets for easier retrieval. If you’re filming with an iPhone 6, the app supports frame rates up to 240fps. You’ll have several encoding options to choose from, including an extreme setting that captures 1080p video at 50Mbps. Filmic Pro was recently refreshed for iOS 9 to make it faster and more reliable.</p>
<p><strong>PRICE:</strong> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/filmic-pro/id436577167?mt=8">$7.99</a></p>

<p><strong>Manual for iPhone </strong></p>
<p>Locked inside your iPhone is a decent camera just waiting to get out. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/manual-custom-exposure-camera/id917146276?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Manual</a> liberates it by unlocking the exposure settings advanced users prefer to adjust on their own, including full independent control over shutter, ISO, white balance, focus and exposure compensation. When you’re shooting in Manual, you’ll be able to view your exposure values, a live histogram, grid overlays and EXIF data. You can activate the iPhone’s LED to serve as a fill flash or delay the shutter for a longer exposure. The only parameter you can’t tweak is aperture, since the iPhone’s aperture is fixed.</p>

<p><strong>Replay</strong></p>
<p>Video editing isn’t typically something people relish doing on mobile devices, but <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/replay-video-editor/id694164275?mt=8">Replay’s</a> simplified approach makes the task far less onerous for iPhone and iPad owners. It’s not sophisticated by the standards of desktop editors, but it does a nice job delivering meaningful features in a mobile-friendly format. Using Replay, you can merge up to 200 photos or videos from your camera roll, iCloud, Facebook or Instagram account, choose from one of 24 styles, add text and select your music (your own or a selection of tracks provided by the app). Armed with your selection, Replay renders out a video that is in sync with the music. You can take a bit more of hands-on approach to customize a few settings. You can choose between a square or 16:9 aspect ratio, trim videos, set focus points, pacing, mute the audio and more. </p>

<p><strong>Snapseed</strong></p>
<p>The Google-owned <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed&amp;hl=en">Snapseed</a> packs a wealth of editing tools to quickly enhance your images. You can sharpen, crop, transform and perform spot repairs to remove dust and dirt. It uses Nik Software’s U Point technology to make adjustments to select areas of an image without marring the surrounding pixels. Like any mobile editor worth its salt, it has filters galore but that’s not Snapseed’s core strength. Instead, it’s the layers-style approach, dubbed Stacks, that adds value. Stacks provides a list of the filters you’ve applied to one image. Using Stacks, you can remove any filter you’ve applied, no matter when you applied it. Stacks also allows you to re-edit or copy any filter and apply it to another image in your collection. Despite fears that it would wither on Google’s vine, Snapseed enjoyed an update as late as July of this year that delivered finer-tipped brushes and deeper zooms. It’s available for both iOS and Android devices.</p>

<p><strong>CTRL+Console</strong></p>
<p>We have a love/hate relationship with our mouse: We love to hate it. But after seeing <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ctrl+console-premiere-final/id635373813?mt=8">CTRL+Console</a>, we may have found a more intuitive replacement, at least for video editing and photo management. The CTRL+Console app runs on iPads and offers a series of customized controls for Adobe Premiere. It syncs with your computer over Wi-Fi and offers touch-based controls that replace mouse-hunting around menus and many of your favorite keyboard shortcuts. The app itself is free but you’ll pay up to $30 for in-app purchases to unlock editing functionality, depending on the version of Premiere you’re using and the types of controls you need. The company is also working on a Lightroom Sorter that turns your iPad into a remote control for Lightroom organizing. You can quickly scroll through your catalogue with a swipe of your finger, rate images, delete them and save them. Goodbye mouse.</p>

<p><strong>Photo Mate R2</strong></p>
<p>Long before Android supported DNG files, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tssystems.photomate2">Photo Mate R2</a> was one of the go-to apps for Android photographers looking for RAW file viewing and decoding. It’s a powerful mobile editor, capable of decoding not just RAW files from a range of cameras, but PSD and TIFF files, too. The app provides a full suite of editing tools, including sharpening, clarity, curves, layers, lens corrections and much more. Edits are applied non-destructively and while you can dial in to make very precise edits, there are dozens of presets on hand to speed things along. Beyond editing, the program can also organize, rate, label and tag images with Lightroom-friendly XMP sidecar files. Images can be filtered based on ratings or metadata and you can view histograms and EXIF data as you scroll through your collection. Photo Mate offers folder-based views of your images and you can create Smart Folders that combine images from several disparate folders into a Smart Folder without changing their locations on your drive. </p>

<p><strong>Adobe Lightroom Mobile</strong></p>
<p>For many photographers, Adobe’s Lightroom takes center stage in their workflow. With Lightroom Mobile, many of the beneficial organizing, ranking and culling tasks that Lightroom performs on the desktop can be done on mobile phones. The <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adobe-photoshop-lightroom/id878783582?mt=8">most recent iOS update (v. 1.5.1)</a> brings videos into the mix, giving you the ability to add, view and share videos in your collections. For still photos, there are new color tools, a new tone curve tool and adjustable vignettes. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.lrmobile&amp;hl=en">Lightroom on Android</a> tends to lag the iOS version in feature deployment, but it is ahead of the Apple version in one important respect: RAW support. Now that Android Lollipop supports RAW files in the DNG format, Lightroom for Android can do full-blown RAW editing on a smartphone (provided said phone runs Lollipop and supports RAW capture). The Android version’s most recent update (v. 1.2) also supports copying and pasting image adjustments from one photo to another. There’s an updated cropping interface, a new auto-straighten tool and a new “Segmented view” in the Android build to organize images by time and location metadata. </p>

<p><strong>Pixelmator</strong> </p>
<p>Packed with an impressive array of editing tools, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id407963104?mt=12">Pixelmator</a> is an iOS app that lets you adjust image colors using customizable presets. You can create non-destructive edits using layers, blend different images together, add text, remove backgrounds and cut-and-paste objects into photos. But it’s more than a mere editing tool. You can paint on images using textured brushes and, thanks to the app’s algorithmic smarts, effects like wetness (for water colors) and brush strokes are faithfully recreated. When you’re done tweaking your files on your phone, Pixelmator can save the finished product as a Photoshop-friendly PSD file if you need to make further enhancements on the desktop. The app can also import and edit PSDs, if you want the workflow to work in reverse. Pixelmator’s tools aren’t confined to the app itself; some of them are available in the iPhone’s Photo app if you add them as an extension.</p>
<p><strong>PRICE:</strong> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id407963104?mt=12">$4.99</a></p>

<p><strong>pCam +  Digital Pro </strong></p>
<p>Unique among many of its peers, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pcam-film-+-digital-pro/id295456485?mt=8">pCam</a> has a pedigree that dates back to the (wait for it) Palm Pilot. Developed by a seasoned assistant camera operator, pCam is a go-to tool for DPs and still photographers as well, with tools that let them make critical exposure calculations on the fly. Using pCam you can measure depth of field, hyperfocal and image circle for cinema cameras. Simply select your camera model from the app’s extensive list, choose an aperture and focal length and enter in the distance to your subject and it can calculate your depth of field. A “preview” button will actually show you what the scene will look like in your camera. With 24 different tools to choose from, pCam can do a lot. </p>

<p><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/11-gear-ROUNDUP-EyeEm-iPad-Discover-a.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>EyeEm</strong></p>
<p>EyeEm has multiple personalities, all of them good. It’s one part image editor, one part image marketplace and one part creative community/social network. Using the editor, you can apply one of 24 filters to tweak the contrast, exposure, saturation, white balance and a few other parameters of your smartphone camera images. You can view and follow photographers on the app as well as participate in photo contests (dubbed “missions”) to win prizes and the esteem of your virtual peers. The newest feature is Market, a stock platform helping photographers monetize their work, whether the photos in question were captured with a smartphone or (gasp) a traditional DSLR. Any EyeEm user can select images in their profile to post to the Market. EyeEm splits the revenue 50/50 and images licensed through the Market are offered on a non-exclusive basis. EyeEm charges image buyers $20 per photo for a standard license and $250 for an extended commercial license. Market photos aren’t falling into a giant abyss though; they’re being judged by EyeEm’s algorithms for their “aesthetic qualities” to serve up what the company views as the best images to potential buyers. EyeEm is available for both <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/eyeem-best-photography-community/id445638931?mt=8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baseapp.eyeem&amp;hl=en">Android</a> devices.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.michaelgrecco.com/">Michael Grecco</a>, who has shot portraits of celebrities and executives for more than two decades, says one of the most important lessons he learned in a workshop with legendary portrait photographer Albert Watson was to bond with the talent before the shoot. “He would walk into the dressing room, sit down, and connect. That’s the primary thing,” Grecco says.
<p>He explains that his initial approach to subjects is like that of a school teacher, trying to calm a nervous kid.</p>
<p>“Remember the first day of school, when you didn’t know what was going on? You were scared. That’s what [portrait subjects] feel. Most people don’t understand what’s going to happen, or what’s needed on set. And if it’s a concept you’re trying to shoot, they want to be sure you aren’t going to mistreat them.”</p>
<p>Grecco starts by explaining the shoot in straightforward terms. “I go through the day and what we’re going to do. I tell them this is what’s required, this is what I’m thinking of, this is how many pictures I’ll need, these are my concepts.”</p>
<p>That starts a conversation and a negotiation: Subjects usually respond by telling Grecco what they’re comfortable doing, and what they want from the shoot. “It’s important for them to know what you need, to listen [to what’s] going to work for them, and try to meet them in the middle,” he says.</p>
<p>Grecco says that if his subjects allow it, he’ll stay with them while they’re getting ready for the shoot. He tries to engage them in conversation about their work and their interests. “I try to find out what turns people on,” he says, noting, “You get into that makeup room, and you’re listening. You’re trying to dissect commonalities.”</p>
<p>To that end, it is important to research his subjects beforehand, he says. “That’s especially true for celebrities, who care about you knowing their accomplishments and who they are.” </p>
<p>For instance, with a recent assignment from <em>Forbes Magazine </em>to photograph violinist, performance artist and YouTube sensation <a href="http://www.lindseystirling.com/">Lindsey Stirling</a>, Grecco says he watched all of her videos. “That enabled me to know what the shoot was going to be and what I could get out of it,” he says.</p>
<p>Grecco always works with at least one assistant—even on small shoots—so he can arrive on set and focus immediately on the subjects, not gear.  Good portraits, he says, are “about being down to earth. It’s the bonding, and getting as close as you can before the shoot.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[In his portraiture, <a href="http://www.joshwool.com/">Josh Wool</a> is drawn to the tension created by a perceived “juxtaposition between what’s on the surface and what’s underneath.” Wool’s preparation and the way he directs his subjects are essential to achieving a consistent, soulful look in his photographs, he says.
<p>Wool creates black-and-white and color portraits, and also uses alternative processes. He says that making sure his lighting setups are dialed in before a shoot helps him focus on engaging his subject. Wool, who teaches workshops, notes, “A lot of people get lost in their lighting or in their camera gear and stop paying attention to their subject. I make sure that I’m prepared ahead of time; I know what the lighting situation is going to be, I have three or four different lighting scenarios that I can pop [subjects] in and out of,” he explains, adding that he uses “a lot of natural light.”</p>
<p>Preparation allows him to focus on his sitter. “The most important thing is to keep really strong engagement with your subjects through conversation,” Wool says. “Some people are difficult, but you still have to keep them engaged in the moment, because the second that person gets distracted or disinterested, it’s going to be really difficult to make a good portrait of them.”</p>
<p>Rather than spending time trying to adjust every aspect of his subjects’ body positions, which can result in images that look “too posed,” he asks them to “move through [traditional portrait] positions,” then photographs them while they’re moving. Wool does a lot of seated portraits, so he’ll ask a subject to, for instance, “drop their left shoulder back, and bring their right shoulder forward and then look in.” Or he’ll ask a subject to adjust a hat or shirtsleeve. “I’m directing them with specific movements. I’m very direct, but I’m not overbearing,” he says. “You’re getting people to do things where you’re not necessarily telling them what you want, it’s a means to get what you want…. I’m getting people to move, but it’s that moment in between the start and finish of that move that I want, rather than just trying to set [the pose] initially. It’s not an easy thing to do, it takes a lot of practice, but it’s not that difficult either.”</p>
<p>Wool says he “just fell into” his way of directing subjects, because it allowed him to get what he was after without having to spend so much time positioning his sitter. He feels that when he’s making a portrait he’s “taking something from [the subject],” but adds that it’s not necessarily linked to the reality of who they are. “At least in my portrait world, I’m creating what my vision of that person is, and those moments between the moments that I catch are the ones that are interesting to me.”<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">	</span></p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<em>Brooklyn-based photographer James Farrell shares some valuable lessons he learned from the photographers he used to assist, about how to negotiate (and collect) the fees and expenses required to deliver the production values his clients expect. &nbsp;</em><br />
<br />
<strong>1. Always ask what the client's budget is.</strong><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"I used to send out estimates that covered everything, to shoot for my dream. Now I ask what the budget is," Farrell says. "That's because the answer tells me whether they're working with real money, or with $1,000."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Knowing what the client has to spend gives Farrell the parameters he needs to plan the shoot, and make it work on the client's budget. For instance, it gives him an idea of how many assistants he will be able to afford, whether there will be enough money to hire a digital tech, and what level of talent he'll be able to hire for the job. In short, the budget determines the level of production values he can bring to the job.<br />
<br />
<strong>2. Push for a bigger budget, and justify the added expenses. </strong><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"I always push to see what [money] they have," Farrell says. One client recently offered him a flat fee for a shoot, but it was clear to Farrell they expected higher production values than the budget allowed for. "I said, 'Do you have money for lights?'" He told the client he needed an additional $500 to rent the lights required for the job. "They came back with $400." It was $400 more than they originally said they could pay.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Farrell says he also pushes on fees for his assistants. Market rates for assistants range from $250 per day for editorial work to $450 or $500 for commercial work. Farrell pushes for two assistants at a minimum of $300 per day. Most clients resist, but he tells them that the assistants he hires are going to help make the client's day run a lot more smoothly, with less stress, and better images at the end of the day. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Usually, clients accept that reasoning, he says, "and when the job is done, they can see that being on set with my team is a smoother experience" than shoots they've done with other photographers.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Farrell notes, however, that commercial clients are more easily convinced to increase a shoot budget. "Editorial budgets are a little more strict."<br />
<br />
<strong>3. Know the going fees and production costs so you don't under-value your work. </strong><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Photographers' fee and expenses vary by market. You owe it to yourself--and your peers--to know what those rates are, and estimate accordingly, Farrell says. He uses BlinkBid estimating software for guidance. BlinkBid and similar estimating software (such as fotoQuote) provide only ranges of numbers, rather than exact estimates. For more exact numbers, Farrell compares notes with other photographers he knows. "We call each other and ask. We're honest with each other about what fees we charge and what the going rates are. It's not a conversation about any particular client, but: What do you think of this number as an advertising rate? Or, what are you charging for e-com on white?'" (i.e., product shots on white seamless for e-commerce use.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>4. When trimming an estimate, cut expenses—not your fee.</strong><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When a client tells Farrell that a bid he's submitted is too high, "I never cut my own fee. We have to stand strong on that," he says. Cutting your fee signals to the client you'll work for less than you have in the past, or for less than what other photographers charge. Clients will leap on that to keep fees down on future assignments. "You'll be pigeonholed into that fee, and it will be hard to raise it" on future estimates, he says.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Instead, find ways to cut expenses if you have to lower your bid to make it more competitive. Farrell says he recently submitted an $80,000 estimate for an ad campaign, and the client told him competing bids were $60,000 to $70,000. The message was that his bid was likely to disqualify him. So he brought his overall number in line by cutting talent costs. "I had gone to a higher-end model agency--Wilhelmina. The client wasn't willing to pay that much, so we found a cheaper source for that."&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>5. Charge rental fees—regardless of whether you rent gear, or use your own.</strong><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"There are plenty of photographer who don't charge [rental fees] for gear they personally own," Farrell says. But charging clients for use of your gear used to be the custom, and it makes good business sense to Farrell. Gear costs money, and it is subject to wear and tear. It has to be purchased, repaired and replaced in time. Farrell says he makes payments amounting to more than $400 per month for his medium format camera, for instance. "If I didn't own it, we'd have to rent it." In other words, if you don't charge clients to rent your gear, you're subsidizing them by paying for something they would otherwise have to pay for you to rent.<br />
<br />
<strong>6. Charge for the little extras that clients ask for.</strong><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When clients ask Farrell on set to shoot things that were not part of the estimate, "be up front and polite. Don't be, 'Ugh, I don't do that.' Go along with it and just ask them: Do you have more budget for this?" If you don't ask, you could be stuck paying overtime for the studio, or overtime to your assistants, because the shoot ends up going longer than planned. Farrell says clients understand that the extras cost money, and they're willing to pay if you ask. "They're trying to get something done. They're going to want to keep you happy and making good stuff for them." He recounts one particular job where a client started asking him to shoot things on set that weren't specified in the purchase order. "I said to the producer, 'This isn't what we agreed to.' They asked me to go along with it, and said, 'We'll find money for this.' We talked after the shoot was over, and worked out a number."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Another common request from clients, Farrell says, is to re-send files he's already sent. "I have to go back and find the file, and re-send them. It's five minutes. You can't bill for five minutes, like a lawyer can." But it adds up to a lot of lost time. "Someone should be paying for that," says Farrell. "Don't think it doesn't go into the back of mind for the next bid. I'll add in a fee--an extra $50 or $100 for post production, knowing what I've had to deal with in the past.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"You have to find a way to deal with it in a way that won't upset them, and won't upset you. I want to be as easy for clients to deal with as possible. I don't want to make their life difficult, but I have to stay strong, and charge what's due to me."<br />
<br />
<strong>7. Be direct—but polite—about late payments.</strong><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Farrell says he typically lets clients take up to 90 days to pay. That's a long time for&nbsp; photographers trying to sustain the cash flow of a small business, but not unreasonable for accounting departments of big companies, where a series of small, unintentional delays can quickly add up to a drawn-out payment schedule.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Once payment is 90 days overdue, Farrell sends a friendly reminder email, with the original invoice attached. "I'll say something like, 'Not sure if this fell through the cracks, but I wanted to check on this invoice. Do you know what happened to it?' Most of the time I'll get an email back that says, 'Sorry, it did fall through the cracks.' And usually I'll get a check within two weeks."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What you don't want to do, he says, is to get heated about late payments. "You have to be polite. They're still your client. Next time they hire someone, they're going to remember that last interaction with you--especially if it's in the form of a letter from your lawyer." That said, Farrell says he would contact a lawyer if the client still hasn't paid after six months, assuming the invoice is for enough money to justify the legal expense. <br />

    <article_text><![CDATA[In addition to her fine-art work, <a href="http://www.francesfdenny.com/">Frances F. Denny</a> shoots editorial and commercial assignments, specializing in evocative and empowering portraits of women. As an undergraduate, Denny studied the representations of women in art and literature, and what she learned informs her depictions of women.
<p>“I think of my subjects as individuals. I try not to push them into cookie-cutter poses, or ideas of how women are supposed to look, whether that be really skinny, or sexy in a contrived way,” Denny says. “I try to read the person’s energy before I take my camera out. I’m trying to watch them, take their temperature. Do they seem really shy? Or a little excited to have their picture taken? Or maybe a lot excited? I want to have fun with it.”</p>
<p>One of the big challenges, she says, is putting people who aren’t professional models at ease right from the start. “Most people have trouble being the center of attention, when they’re not used to being in front of a camera,” she says.</p>
<p>She’s mindful that many of her subjects may be intimidated. “I think people think the photographer is going to be intimidating, especially in New York. So I’m not going to walk into a shoot being full of bravado, or start ordering people around, or be aloof. That’s not my style—which helps people be at ease around you.”</p>
<p>Denny’s advice is to acknowledge the discomfort directly. “You assure them that [you’re] going to tell [them] exactly what to do. And that puts them at ease. It’s out in the open at that point.”</p>
<p>What you shouldn’t do, she warns, is tell a nervous subject to “just relax” because “that’s the worst thing you can say to someone who is anxious. It’s not their job [to relax], it’s my job to get them to relax.”</p>
<p>Another strategy she uses is to divert the subject’s attention by saying something to draw attention to herself. “Sometimes I’ll joke at my own expense. I’ll be setting up the lights and trying to talk to them, and I’ll be adjusting something and I’ll falter in my attention to them so I’ll say something like, ‘Just hang on a second, my brain isn’t quick enough to talk and fix the lights at the same time.’”</p>
<p>Once she’s ready to start shooting, Denny gives her subjects “tons of direction. I’ll ask them to stand up. Sit back down. Take your hands out and put them down in a certain way. I literally tell them where to put their fingers, and I’ll go move it myself if I need to. People need a lot of direction at first, when they aren’t used to being photographed—and that helps loosen them up a lot.”</p>
<p>At the same time, she’s watching how her subjects react to the direction she’s giving them. And she’s trying to read them. For instance, Denny is watching to see if the subject is nervous about some aspect of her appearance. “Does she keep smoothing her bangs, for instance? In that case, I’ll ask, ‘Is it OK if I touch your hair for a moment?’ And I’ll smooth her bangs, whether or not they need to be smoothed. If you do that early in the shoot, she feels that you’re watching out for her. She can trust you. It’s a way to relax them, and say, ‘You don’t have to worry about this. I’ve got it.’”</p>
<p>Denny says it is also important not to take the work too seriously if you want to put your subjects at ease. Sure, she acknowledges: The picture is important, and in the case of commercial and editorial work, a client is paying for it. But Denny says she learned the value of lightheartedness on set from photographers she’s observed (<a href="http://www.cigharvey.com/">Cig Harvey</a>) and assisted (<a href="http://lucybrownarmstrong.com/">Lucy Brown Armstrong</a> and <a href="http://hwhitaker.com/">Hannah Whitaker</a>).</p>
<p>“On every shoot, there is laughter. Laughter is so important to break the ice. It says, this is so ridiculous, what we’re doing. [The work] is important, but if there’s this model, and she’s supposed to [look like she’s] biting into a cheeseburger, and she has to do it over and over again without biting into it, and we’re putting glycerin all over the cheeseburger to make it look shiny, and the poor model is drooling because it smells so good—there comes a point when you just have to laugh.”</p>
<p>Finally, Denny advises, encourage subjects with praise. “When something beautiful transpires, everyone on set knows it because I’ll be verbal about it.”</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Photojournalist <a href="http://www.pietertenhoopen.com/">Pieter Ten Hoopen</a> has worked around the world for <em>Le Monde, The New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine</em> and international aid organizations. “When it comes to my documentary projects, I like to do portraits because it gives me a great opportunity — in Nepal or Sudan or Sierra Leone — to have a meeting with people and slow down, to observe the tiny details,” he says.
<p>In zones of conflict or natural disaster,  Ten Hoopen is working with subjects who may feel vulnerable or traumatized. When he approaches them, he treats them respectfully. The photographer notes, “I start as I start in Sweden, when I talk to people on the street. I say hello, then we have a small conversation and then I say, ‘I want to make a portrait.’” </p>
<p>He always explains how the portrait will be used and where it will be seen. “I think it is important for photographers to ask themselves: What is your purpose? I’m not a photographer who walks around with a camera around my neck taking pictures all the time. I work on projects with a very specific goal or meaning,” he says.  </p>
<p>He asks for a portrait only once, he says. “If someone wants to be photographed, and if they trust me, they’ll say yes. I can sometimes hear a fixer or translator trying to convince them, and that really sets me off. I don’t like that: It’ll be reflected in the portrait.” </p>
<p>This year, on assignment for <a href="http://www.emergency.it/en-index.html">Emergency</a>, an Italian humanitarian organization that brings medical assistance to victims of conflict, Ten Hoopen documented the work of doctors at Emergency’s pediatric clinics at the Mayo refugee camp near Khartoum, Sudan, and in Bangui, Central African Republic. “I have no problems with traditional reportage, but in those situations I also like to set up an environment where you can meet people in a different way,” he says. At the Mayo camp, clinic workers helped him make a studio out of old bed linens. </p>
<p>At first, he says, people were skeptical: “Who is this very red dude in the hot sun building a studio?” After a few hours, however, people were lining up for a portrait sitting, “and it’s fun,” he says. </p>
<p>Each portrait is collaborative, and begins with a brief interview, he says. “I don’t shoot that much; I think I’m looking a lot. It can be from five or 10 to 20 images.” </p>
<p>Once he starts shooting, he says little. “If I’m starting to direct a lot, I can take away the spontaneous expression they have,” he explains. “I’m looking for a state of mind, a concentration in the eyes, or their way of holding their child.”   </p>
<p>He adds, “I feel it’s important to be fast but not in a hurry. People’s time is precious. If you feel you have the potential for a great portrait, and you feel you don’t have it yet, you continue. It’s a classic thing. Someone can be nervous and stiff, and suddenly you say, ‘I think we’re good,’ and they’re surprised, and then start to move around a little more, and then the moment is there and you have the portrait.” After the shoot, he says, “We sit down, and I show them the images on my phone or on the back of my camera.” </p>
<p>To new photographers who feel awkward approaching strangers, he says, “When you’re relaxed and enjoy it and you’re interested in something you think is important,  I think you will reflect that. I’ve always liked meeting people a lot. It’s one of the reasons I became a photographer.” </p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.amivitale.com/">Ami Vitale’s</a> long-term project about wildlife conservation in Northern Kenya began with a story that she had trouble getting editors interested in. In 2009, conservationists were moving four of the last northern white rhinoceroses on the planet from a Czech Republic zoo to the <a href="http://www.olpejetaconservancy.org/">Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya</a>. Vitale, who is now a contract photographer for <em>National Geographic</em>, had to cobble together the funds to cover the story because “in the beginning, most editors thought the move was not visual enough for a photo essay.”
<p>After learning more about the struggle between local conservation groups and poachers during that first trip, Vitale decided to pour her own resources into return visits and delve deeper into the story. She’s since partnered with the <a href="http://www.nature.org/?src=sea.AWP.prnone.crv1&amp;kt=NatureConservancy&amp;&amp;&amp;gclid=CPPe8u2_i8kCFdgBgQodGWYB8w">Nature Conservancy</a>, <a href="http://www.lewa.org/">Lewa Wildlife Conservancy</a> and the <a href="http://www.nrt-kenya.org/">Northern Rangelands Trust</a>; has run a successful crowdfunding campaign; won a World Press Photo award; and has built a community of <a href="https://instagram.com/amivitale/?hl=en">more than 320,000 Instagram followers</a>. Assignments, speaking engagements and other opportunities have followed as well, she says. Here, Vitale shares advice for creating support for a long-term project. </p>
<p><strong>Invest Early in the Project</strong></p>
<p>It often takes a personal investment of time and money to lay the groundwork for a long-term project, Vitale says. “It takes time to even understand what the story is and how to tell it in a compelling way, so in the beginning I usually have to fund the work myself,” she explains. The advantage of starting the project yourself is that you “have intellectual independence and don’t have the pressure of what a magazine or audience wants to see.” </p>
<p><strong>Develop Relationships with Key Stakeholders</strong></p>
<p>One of the non-profits Vitale worked with early on distrusted all media because of bad experiences they’d had in the past. Part of building trust is “giving something back,” Vitale says. She identified Lewa Wildlife Conservancy and Northern Rangelands Trust as organizations that could help her, and thought about how she could help them with the work they were already doing. “They had an amazing story, and I knew there was an angle that was positive and could motivate action,” she says. </p>
<p>“I have helped them build their own social media followings. They tell me that my photos have brought in new donors and visitors to their conservancy. It’s made a tangible difference financially and created more awareness about their important work. Recently, I had a print drive that raised over $8,000 for them.”</p>
<p><strong>Find Stories that are Different</strong></p>
<p>“In conservation, and frankly in many stories of conflict, we often sensationalize and leave out the complexities of the the story,” Vitale says. “For example, in Northern Kenya, the story is: It’s a war zone, it’s dangerous and look at these horrible people who are massacring the wildlife.” Vitale has chosen to tell positive stories about the work locals are doing to protect the animals. “I want people to understand how complex these stories are and also give them something tangible that they can do in their own lives that will make a difference,” she says. “I don’t want anyone to get the impression that I think everything is fine, but I do believe there are some hopeful signs. It completely inspired me once I started seeing the stories firsthand, met the people involved [in protecting the animals], and witnessed their dedication.” </p>
<p>Vitale says that finding these stories helped engage her audience. “I believe people are motivated to action when they see stories where things are progressing; it can’t just be about death and destruction. I don’t shy away from showing the bad stuff, but I use it as the beginning of the story, not inevitably as the end.... I think a planet with a hopeful and human story is more beautiful, and telling that story is more relatable.”</p>
<p><strong>Build An Audience Around Your Project</strong></p>
<p>Creating a body of work that tells a compelling story is the first step in a long-term documentary project. But, Vitale says, “Once you have finished the images and story, the real work has just begun.” A photojournalist’s ability to communicate with an audience directly through social media channels has altered what audiences expect from photographers, Vitale says. “In the past, there were clear lines drawn about the role of photographer/photojournalist and what we were supposed to do. ‘Advocacy’ was almost a dirty word for a reputable journalist. Today, we have the opportunity to engage directly with our audience, who almost expect more engagement and advocacy. It turns out, they don’t necessarily want us to be the proverbial ‘fly on the wall.’ Observing is not enough. They really care about a lot of the stories we bring them and want us to do more and show them what they can do other than just look at pictures.”</p>
<p><strong>Think About Consistency and Captions on Social Media</strong></p>
<p>Social media can be incredibly effective, but it’s also time-consuming. Vitale counsels that photographers should “resist the urge to jump into every social media platform and instead select the platforms that are most relevant to your audience.” Instagram is one of Vitale’s primary tools. In just a year and a half, she’s built a following of more than 320,000. Consistency and captions have been vital to engaging followers, she says. Vitale posts every day to <a href="https://instagram.com/amivitale/?hl=en">her Instagram feed</a>, but is selective about the photos she shares. “Consistency is important both in what you post and how regularly you post,” says Vitale, who posts images shot on assignments, and certain personal images. “If you build a community around a human rights issue and suddenly start posting selfies, you will lose your audience. Post every day. Pick your best images and curate your site as you would [a story] for a magazine.”</p>
<p>About writing captions for Instagram photos, Vitale says, “Most people want to understand the story behind the image. One of the best examples I’ve seen is the content <a href="http://www.randyolsonproductions.com/">Randy Olson</a> and writer <a href="http://neilshea.net/">Neil Shea</a> have created for <a href="https://instagram.com/explore/tags/ngwatershedstories/">#Ngwatershedstories</a> [about the ecosystem between northern Ethiopia and southern Kenya]. Together they have created something far more powerful than the sum of their individual work. They don’t worry that the captions are too long but rather think about how to tell a powerful story.”</p>
<p><strong>Interact With Your Audience</strong></p>
<p>People are more engaged when they feel they are part of a conversation, Vitale says. “So many of us broadcast only. It’s like we are standing on a podium, shouting our messages out. Speak to people one on one. Try not to constantly pitch your brand. This does not mean that you can’t sometimes promote your work. It just means that you need to engage with people and listen. Try not to let a statement go unanswered on your social media.” </p>
<p><strong>Ask Your Audience to Get Involved</strong></p>
<p>“Loving a photo alone is not enough to create change,” Vitale says. She encourages her audience to follow the organizations she works with and find ways to contribute to wildlife conservation. “It is so important that people and communities realize they can get involved and you need to give them ways to engage; I try to show them that photos are not only something to look at and admire. Tell them a story, get them involved, and help them see themselves in your story.” </p>
<p><strong>Embrace Others Sharing Your Images</strong></p>
<p>“Make it as easy as possible for people to share your work in whatever way they can, and don’t worry about people stealing [your photo],” Vitale says. “If it’s any good, they will rip it off. Embrace that. A repost on Instagram, or a Tweet with a call to action is actually helping your cause.”</p>
<p><strong>Don’t Just Share Your Own Work</strong></p>
<p>Vitale says it’s important to share “good, readable content” with your audience. “Build a steady pipeline of articles and things to share every day” on Facebook or Twitter, she advises. Vitale says it also helps to form alliances with organizations or individuals that can share your work and whose work you can share. She’s made connections through social media to key people and groups in the conservation field. “Find a way to tap into your audience’s energy and put them to work,” she says. </p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[The triple bidding process inevitably ends with one photographer landing the assignment—and two also-rans. The difference between them comes down to a number of factors, including not only submitting an estimate that meets budget constraints, but convincing the creatives that you can deliver an ad that meets the client’s needs. Two of the most important ways photographers can win creatives’ trust is by making a good impression during the creative call, and by developing a treatment afterwards that presents—in words and pictures—an appealing way to produce and execute the assignment. 
<p>Even when the creatives don’t ask for them, many photographers take the time to write and submit treatments—believing they are the best way to illustrate a unique spin on the assignment, their understanding of the client’s strategy, and their solutions to the technical or logistical challenges of the job.</p>
<p>The treatment builds on the information exchanged during an initial conference call when the agency’s creatives explain the campaign’s overall creative direction. Before the end of the call, New York photographer <a href="http://www.kareemblack.com/">Kareem Black</a> explains,  “I’ll say, ‘I’m excited about this. I would love to have a few days to put some ideas together for you to look at.’” He then prepares a document, usually eight to 12 pages long, explaining his ideas for lighting, casting, wardrobe, styling and scheduling. He notes, “The treatment is a detailed plan of how I would put it all together.” </p>
<p>A treatment is also an opportunity for the photographer to demonstrate a thorough understanding of what the client wants the ad to accomplish. “People aren’t hiring you to create great pictures, but to get results,” says Seattle photographer <a href="http://www.keatleyphoto.com/">John Keatley</a>. “You have to communicate that you understand the clients’ goals and needs, and that you can help them meet their goals.” </p>
<p>Learning what those goals are begins with the creative call. </p>
<p><strong>The Creative Conversation and Close Listening</strong></p>
<p>Typically, the agency sends the three photographers invited to bid on a job some comps or sketches for the ads, then sets up a conference call with each photographer and his or her agent. This is the first and best opportunity to learn specifics about what the creatives want, says Los Angeles photographer <a href="http://www.evakolenko.com/">Eva Kolenko</a>. “It’s 80 percent listening, 10 percent asking questions and maybe 10 percent me selling myself.” She adds, “In listening and asking the right questions, you’re showing your interest in the project.” </p>
<p>The “right” questions help a photographer plan an approach: Does the client want models or street casting? Should the ads be shot handheld or on a tripod? Adjectives like “upscale” or “fun” mean different things to different people, and asking for clarification helps guide the photographer’s planning for locations or styling.   </p>
<p>Understanding the demographic the client wants to reach and the message the ad has to send are essential to preparing a successful treatment. Keatley notes, “I try to say, ‘I hear you saying you want to do a portrait of a woman with an animal, but what’s the goal? Are we trying to raise awareness, or drive foot traffic into a retail store?’” He adds, “On the creative call, I always ask for a list of keywords that would describe the response they want from the viewer.” </p>
<p>With an understanding of the client’s needs, the photographer can begin to offer suggestions about how to shoot the images. Black says, “I’m thinking on my feet, saying, ‘What do you think of this approach?’ Or, ‘This is how I think this could happen.’” </p>
<p>Earlier in his commercial career, Black recalls, “I used to say, ‘Oh, this is easy.’” Then his rep, <a href="http://www.ba-reps.com/about">Howard Bernstein</a>, gave him some useful feedback. Black explains, “What I was trying to say was, ‘This will go without a hitch,’ but my rep pointed out that this is something that the people on the call worked on for weeks or months. Saying it’s ‘easy’ makes their work sound simple. Another way to say it would be, ‘We can make this happen.’” </p>
<p>Photographer <a href="http://www.zacharyscottphoto.com/">Zachary Scott</a> of Los Angeles sees the initial call as a conversation and a chance to show how he would collaborate. He also notes that suggesting dramatic changes to the art direction during the initial call might sound like criticism. Instead, he advises, “Offer smaller shifts that put your stamp on it.” </p>
<p>Suggestions should reference the client’s goals. Keatley recalls talking to creatives about the Instagram campaign he shot earlier this year for <a href="https://www.hoteltonight.com/">Hotel Tonight</a>, the hotel booking app. The brief called for images of people in unpleasant settings—a leaky basement, an office cubicle—who were already prepared for their vacation getaways. The client wanted the ad to increase brand awareness and, Keatley recalls, “grab people’s attention and be bold.” He noted, however, that the people in the sketches weren’t looking at the camera. Keatley says he told the creatives, “I love the concepts, but I feel they’d be more engaging if people were looking at the camera.” He suggested shooting straight-on portraits of each subject in small, shallow sets built in a studio. Keatley says, “The concept was the same but the approach changed.” (It helped, he adds, that building sets eliminated the need for location scouting, and allowed him to shoot six portraits faster.) </p>
<p><strong>Separating the Money Conversation</strong></p>
<p>The creative call is a chance to learn “the overarching creative direction,” says Kolenko. She leaves the discussion of budget to her rep, <a href="http://www.sharpeonline.com/">John Sharpe</a>, who directs questions to the art buyer, either during the call or in a follow-up email.</p>
<p>Photographers who don’t have reps also need to learn what the budget is in order to prepare an estimate. Keatley’s advice to them is: “Talk about the creative first: ‘What’s your dream? What’s your goal?’ Then come back saying, ‘Based on what we discussed, let’s talk about numbers.” He, too, says the production and budget issues are best discussed with the art buyer alone. </p>
<p>Even during the creative discussion, he says, there are ways to glean how the creatives perceive the scale of the production. He notes, “One question we ask is: ‘Is this your first time working with this client and are you interested in impressing them, or is everyone being budget conscious?’ That’s a clue.”   </p>
<p><strong>Tips for a Good Call</strong></p>
<p>Scott says, “Call in from a land line, don’t breathe heavily into the phone—and make sure your crew follows the same protocol.” If you’re sick, jet lagged or tired, he says, “Reschedule. Be rested and prepared to talk with energy.”</p>
<p>Black notes that, though he works from his home studio, he wears business attire for the conference call. He explains, “It puts me in a different mindset” than wearing a t-shirt.  </p>
<p><strong>Writing the Treatment</strong></p>
<p>“There’s no quick way to write a treatment letter,” says Kolenko. “I’ve tried methods where I cut and paste from older treatments, but every job is so specific, it doesn’t work that way. Every job has its own challenges.”</p>
<p>After the creative call, she says, “I like to sit with my notes and then I can really visualize what my process will be, and what the production will be like from start to finish. Then I offer those solutions in a lot more detail in my treatment.”</p>
<p>The treatment should reiterate the client’s goals. Black says for one assignment, the agency had sent him concept boards designed with a bright color palette; he mimicked those colors in the PDF of his treatment. “They were trying to say they were going for a certain vibe, and in my treatment I was trying to say: I am taking that in and running with it.”</p>
<p>Black recently wrote a 12-page treatment that began with a thank-you page, and ended with his bio. He devoted several pages to showing the work of wardrobe and makeup stylists he liked for the job, because the creatives had stressed the importance of those to the success of the ad. “I also discussed managing our time well,” he says. The shoot called for a large cast, and lots of time spent on hair and makeup. He addressed the challenge in his treatment, noting, “Preparation is key. I said I’m always aware of the schedule, but it’s important that the models not be aware of the time pressure.” </p>
<p>When he’s illustrating how he would shoot the ad, he says, “I always use my own photography in the treatment, in order to say: I’ve done this already.”</p>
<p>Kolenko, who shoots many lifestyle and pharmaceutical ads, says casting is often an important part of her jobs. In an estimate, she might list line items such as casting days or a baby wrangler; in her treatment, she would explain her methods for eliciting emotion from her subjects—who might be kids or actors portraying disease sufferers. She then submits her treatment and her estimate together.  </p>
<p>“The treatment is a great way to justify the cost,” she says. “If you ask why the casting cost is six grand, you can go to my treatment and see what will happen in pre-pro, and that it will guarantee that much more success in the shoot.”</p>
<p>A treatment is more than a selling tool, Kolenko adds. “It’s also a great way for me to envision what every day of the shoot will be, and what has to happen in pre-production to make it work.” She shares her treatment with her producer and assistants, “so they can understand what has to happen.” </p>
<p>Writing treatments and estimates is time consuming, and offers no guarantee for success. Scott counsels photographers to stay enthusiastic. “This is an opportunity to show the ad agency what it’s like to work with you.  If the art buyer enjoys the bid process with you and your team, they’ll call again.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[When we started asking videographers about the challenges of shooting 4K video, we were sure we’d hear things like, “you need a supercomputer to edit it.” But as videographer <a href="http://www.provideocoalition.com/bhallett">Brian Hallett</a> says, the computer horsepower in his 2011 MacBook Pro has handled many 4K video editing projects just fine. Instead, there are other, often subtle, challenges with jumping into 4K. 
<p><strong>Consider the Codec</strong></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the filmmakers we spoke with always opt to record RAW video as their first choice among video file options for the same reason still photographers shoot RAW: It provides greater latitude to recover details in highlights and shadows, and delivers a file that’s more easily color graded during post production. But there are times when shooting a 4K RAW file isn’t necessarily the best choice. For Hallett, codec choice is often determined by deadlines as much as quality considerations. For short turnarounds, he will sometimes forgo RAW files and instead opt for a 10-bit ProRes file since it can be processed in near real-time while still retaining enough quality to satisfy clients. Adding effects and color grades to ProRes files will tack on extra processing time, but it will still be a shorter workflow than wrestling RAW files, Hallett says. </p>
<p>While RAW files offer the most flexibility for post-process color grading and exposure adjustments, shooting a compressed format doesn’t mean you completely surrender those options. Many cameras—including a growing number of DSLRs and mirrorless cameras—support recording a Log format. A Log file isn’t a RAW file since it has exposure information like white balance and ISO baked in, but a Log file does produce a de-saturated image that allows for effective color grading during post-processing, Hallett says. Log formats go by a variety of (mostly unimaginative) names depending on the camera you use—Sony’s is S-Log, Canon’s is Canon Log, Arri dubs theirs LogC, etc.—but the effect is the same. When RAW is too time-consuming, a 10-bit ProRes Log file gives you second, color-gradable option.</p>
<p><strong>Easy On The ISO</strong></p>
<p>Many video cameras—not just 4K models—can’t cope with low light as well as DSLRs can. And, unlike DSLRs, video cameras have limited native ISO ranges. That means that ISO isn’t as effective a tool to recover details in a scene that is shrouded in darkness or shadows. When shooting with a cinema camera, you have to think a bit counter-intuitively, says photographer and cinematographer <a href="http://www.jaredmoossy.com/">Jared Moossy</a>. “With motion you have to bring up the light to show low light,” he says. In other words, it means adding artificial light, not cranking the camera above its base ISO, which for many video cameras is 400 or 800. “I’ve pushed it one or two stops but never pushed it more than that,” Moossy says. In 4K, where details resolve more sharply than in HD, ISO-induced grain looks all the worse.</p>
<p><strong>Budget (Both Money and Time)</strong></p>
<p>The high resolution of 4K imposes high costs that impact every line in a budget—more memory, more time in post production, higher-end optics, etc.—but since it’s fast become a buzzword many commercial clients will ask for it before fully understanding what that implies for their budgets. “Everyone wants to get the biggest and best just to say they have the biggest and best,” Moossy observes. Knowing how to budget a 4K production, and especially what to cut if the budget is too high, is a skill that Moossy finds he’s increasingly called on to exercise. </p>
<p>“Usually accessories are the first to go,” Moossy says. He’ll cut the number of monitors, group shots that need a certain tool, like a jib, into a single day to shorten rental durations and then, only then, will he consider compromising on camera or lenses. </p>
<p>“I’ll compromise on the camera before the lenses, but usually, when it’s that tight of a budget, you end up compromising on both.” </p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[In order to have more control of her productions, photographer and director <a href="http://candykennedy.com/">Candy Kennedy</a> formed a production company—which includes a producer, director of photography, stylists, casting directors and other team members—that together creates test images, storyboards, videos, creative concepts and other materials that she pitches directly to clients. Kennedy, who shoots lifestyle, kids and sports, formed Motion Camera Company Inc. earlier this year after signing with reps <a href="http://www.jkand.com/">JK&amp;</a>.
<p>“If you just stick to [photography or directing] and you don’t have your whole team working with you, you’re limited,” she says. Clients are “going to go to another production company” for needs you can’t fill, and you’ll just be the photographer or director, she explains. In that scenario, you’ll be at the mercy of producers you don’t know, who might “end up losing a job because they over quote,” or may botch the production, leaving you to deal with—and produce work from—a mess. The latter scenario happened recently to Kennedy on a shoot for a sportswear brand. It was “the worst production I’ve ever been on,” she says, and she knew that if her producer had been there things would have gone much differently. </p>
<p>“As a photographer, I think you need to be in control of everything; you need to know who you’re working with; you need to have a brilliant team to rely on and know that they have your back when things get tough,” Kennedy says.</p>
<p>Having a production team also means being able to work together to create pitches for clients that an individual would struggle to produce on her own. Kennedy’s team does this by testing for specific clients. “I know a lot of photographers aren’t big on testing,” she says, “but we do it, and when we test, we focus on going after a [specific] client. Together, we conceptualize for clients we want to work with.” The producer, stylists, casting directors and other team members Kennedy works with contribute to the tests with the understanding that they’ll be hired if her production company wins the work they’re after.</p>
<p>This year, for example, Kennedy learned that <a href="http://www.sandals.com/">Sandals</a>, the company that owns all-inclusive resorts on several Caribbean islands, wanted to create “love stories” for each of their resorts. Kennedy’s rep, John Kenney, got in touch with the company and got them to agree to hear a pitch for the love story concept. Kennedy and her partner in her production company, <a href="http://markshermanfilm.com/">Mark Sherman</a>, then created storyboards and edited together video pulled from stock libraries online. Kennedy also went out and shot new beach images to supplement the small amount of beach work she had in her portfolio. She edited the stills work into a custom digital book created on <a href="http://issuu.com/">Issuu</a>, the digital publishing app, and sent the whole package to the client.</p>
<p>Sandals ended up hiring Kennedy and her team to produce stills and a two-minute video in Antigua, which the company used to launch a social media contest soliciting love stories from past customers. Sandals liked the work Kennedy and her team did so much, they’ve hired them to produce another video and stills campaign. </p>
<p>In August, Kennedy brought her team together to create a pitch to <a href="http://www.converse.com/us/en/go">Converse</a> for their kids shoes advertising. JK&amp; had contacted Converse, and they’d requested Kennedy’s kids portfolio. “Instead of just sending what I had, I wanted to really impress them, so we pulled together a team and did a Converse-inspired shoot,” she says. At press time she was using the photos to design an editorial-style piece for Converse that she hoped would win she and her team work with the brand.</p>
<p>“We’re putting a lot of effort into [these pitches], but it’s not just for the one client,” Kennedy explains. “If you get this stuff done and you get the job, it’s just going to lead to more jobs. So I find that even if I’m testing and I’m spending days working on visual boards and creative concepts for these clients, it’s totally worth it because they’re huge clients and it’s not just one job you’re going to get from them. It’s going to be a couple of jobs.” Even if a brand doesn’t bite on a custom pitch from Kennedy, the work she and her team does on it will lead to opportunities with other brands that might be a fit for the work they create, she believes.</p>
<p>Pitching for new business from clients makes collaborating with a team even more essential. “You’ve got to have the resources, you’ve got to have a team,” Kennedy says. “Obviously they’re working for free, which no one really likes, but they’re working towards an end goal, which is winning over the client.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.tobysmith.com/">Toby Smith</a> has been pitching his work directly to companies in industries that are rarely photographed, such as energy and satellite technology, because of his desire to produce “over ambitious” personal projects that require financial resources beyond his means and access he can’t get on his own. By building relationships with a few key companies, he’s been able to complete projects that he licenses to editorial and commercial clients. Smith creates stories about industry, science and the environment through images of landscapes, people and facilities that the general public rarely sees. His clients include <em>National Geographic, TIME, The New York Times, The Guardian</em>, Scottish and Southern Energy and O2, among many others.
<p>In exchange for access to a company’s facilities and help with some of his travel expenses, Smith gives the company images that they can use in their “below the line” branding, which can include their corporate Web site and annual reports. These arrangements include a few conditions: Smith is first and foremost interested in publishing his stories editorially, and many publications require at least regional exclusivity, so the companies Smith partners with can’t have access to his photographs for a period of up to a year and a half. “There’s a real understanding with whoever grants me access that, if they are going to get any usage down the line, there’s a big period of exclusivity to myself and <a href="http://infocus.gettyimages.com/profile/patrick-di-nola">Patrick Di Nola at Getty Images Reportage</a> [Smith’s agent] to sell the project editorially as journalism,” Smith notes. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the company has to be all right with the publicity. “If they’re not interested in seeing themselves in the press, then it’s a cold start,” Smith says. He also insists that companies give him freedom to photograph what he wants. That way, he says, “there’s integrity in what I’m shooting, and I’m building my own story and building my own pathways.” He says he tries to convey to his partners that “the less they get involved in guiding the creative and the more they concentrate on helping me out by introductions within companies, the more they’ll get out of it.”</p>
<p>Also, Smith stipulates that for any “above the line” usage of his images, “to advertise their services or actually use it to aid their commercial income… Getty Images would expect to start charging them the relevant licensing fees [for that usage].”</p>
<p>When they pitch his stories to editorial clients, Smith and his rep disclose his partnerships up front—explaining to editors that Smith shot the work either in partnership with, or with financial assistance from, the company. They also offer a list of contacts that will help a publication report their own story on a given subject. </p>
<p>Smith begins his projects by researching industries and mapping out the story he wants to tell. When he has a question “I can’t answer from my desk,” he says, he knows it’s time to start exploring the subject with his camera. His research also helps him when it’s time to approach prospective partners within an industry. “When I do get someone on the phone, or when I bump into someone at a trade conference, or start to try and do some targeted networking to get access, I’m familiar with their language, their concerns and their subject matter—and that immediately helps the dialogue flow a lot more naturally.”</p>
<p>Finding the right person to contact within a company is a challenge, Smith says. “There’s no one in these companies whose job remit includes ‘helping contemporary photographer get into everything,’” he notes. “You have to find someone who is interested on top of their existing workload to give you that time and energy, and help build the relationships and sell it into the wider company as well.” Recently he’s been approaching upper management, “rather than trying to go through the communications door and getting stuck in their branding agency.” A communications agency working for a corporation often has its own agenda, and it doesn’t include “a photographer coming in and doing a personal photo project efficiently when they’re trying to sell a big communications package over two years,” Smith explains.</p>
<p>Smith says he’s often licensed his images not to the companies he’s partnered with, but to their “downstream partners,” who are responsible for selling energy or products Smith’s partners produce. For instance, a Scottish energy company he partnered with used his images for trade shows and communications. Later, “their retail arm came back and licensed a few images that were used by advertising agencies to sell their electricity products back to consumers,” he explains.</p>
<p>Other opportunities have grown out of his partnerships. “One of the things I’ve really liked about having a closer dialogue with the different industries while doing a project is that you have a really nice long-tail relationship afterwards and other opportunities come out of it,” Smith says. For instance, he worked with a Hong Kong-based energy company to document renewable energy facilities in China in which they’d invested. After Smith showed an edit of that work to the company’s CEO, “he immediately commissioned me to spend five weeks in India looking at what his company was doing there,” Smith says. Another company Smith worked with commissioned him to create a video about a non-governmental organization they support.</p>
<p>He’s also licensed images to other companies working in industries he’s covered, but he’s careful not to put his work into stock libraries. That’s in gratitude to the people who facilitate the access, because once it’s in stock, potentially their competitors or people who are less professional about where the images could get used could get hold of them,” he explains.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[What do you do when your documentary project has grown from a single concept to a sprawling, complex narrative with multiple points of view? For <a href="http://www.jongsmaoneill.com/">Eline Jongsma and Kel O’Neill</a>, the award-winning filmmaking team, technology is the answer. Through collaborations with programmers and other experts, they’ve produced projects in which multiple stories coexist and give viewers a choice of which narratives they follow. The duo have also expanded the audience for their work by creating innovative, Web-based presentations.
<p>They are currently in production on <em><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jongsmaoneill/the-ark-a-vr-film-about-the-worlds-most-endangered">The Ark</a></em>, a documentary they conceived to be displayed on virtual reality platforms such as Google Cardboard and Samsung Gear VR. It will give viewers the experience of following the parallel stories of scientists in San Diego and park rangers in Kenya who are trying to save the world’s last northern white rhinoceroses. This year, their proposal for the project won the first <a href="http://www.timhetheringtontrust.org/news-and-calendar/2015/02/visionary-award-tim-hetherington-trust">Visionary Award from the Tim Hetherington Trust</a>, named for the late photojournalist and filmmaker who created innovative video presentations from the work he made in conflict zones. Also this year, Jongsma and O’Neill were nominated for a 2015 News &amp; Documentary Emmy for their most ambitious project to date, <a href="http://www.jongsmaoneill.com/new-gallery-5/">the interactive documentary</a> <em><a href="http://www.jongsmaoneill.com/new-gallery-5/">Empire</a></em>, a look at the legacy of Dutch colonialism. </p>
<p>They have continually evolved their documentary storytelling methods since Jongsma, a photographer, and O’Neill, a former copywriter, began combining their talents. “I have always flirted with video, but I never knew how to merge the power of still photography with the documentary form until I started working with Kel,” Jongsma says. “Video and photography always felt constricted, because I wanted to bend the frame somehow. Now we’re doing a live-action VR project and it’s blowing my mind.”</p>
<p>Their company, Jongsma + O’Neill, has produced branded content and videos for such clients as Red Bull Media Group, Siemens and <em>Vice</em>. The process of creating their own interactive, multilayered projects begins, O’Neill says, with the question: How should the story be told? “There’s no reason to make a project interactive unless the interactivity in some way arises from, and reinforces, the themes of the story,” he says. Jongsma agrees, noting, “We chose this type of ‘fractured narrative’ because, early on in the production of <em>Empire</em>, we realized that we wanted to highlight the multiple perspectives and multiple layers of the subject matter.”</p>
<p>They began working on <em>Empire </em>in 2010. After giving away most of their possessions and putting the rest in storage, Jongsma and O’Neill traveled to ten countries over the next three years, chasing stories of the impact of the world’s first multinational corporations: the Dutch East and West India Companies.   </p>
<p>They met white-supremacist farmers in South Africa, gold miners in Suriname and Freemasons in Ghana. Initially, their plan was to make a more traditional documentary film. But as they got further into the project, they realized that the multiple stories and perspectives would be better served with a less linear storyline. “There’s a huge amount of diversity in<em> Empire</em>, not just in terms of the ethnicity of the subjects, but in terms of beliefs and lifestyles,” explains O’Neill, “Despite their differences, all of these people and communities share space on the same planet, and are shaped by a shared historical past. So at a certain point, we started looking at organizational systems that could respectfully bring together all of these contradictory, co-existing perspectives into a shared space.” The result was a documentary in four chapters, shown on split screens to display connected but independent stories. </p>
<p>Initially, Jongsma and O’Neill displayed <em>Empire</em> at film festivals and art shows as an installation, with multiple screens showing the stories simultaneously. While successful, they quickly realized that to reach more people, they would need to step out of what O’Neill calls “the art/film echo chamber.” They felt that a Web-based presentation would be the best way to make the project more accessible without compromising the multi-screen format. </p>
<p>In 2013, Jongsma and O’Neill were chosen to be part of <a href="http://www.pbs.org/pov/hackathon/">PBS.org’s POV Hackathon</a>, a two-day event where filmmakers team up with designers and developers to create interactive, Web-based stories. “At the POV Hackathon, we had two days to execute. There was no leeway,” O’Neill explains. At some hackathons, creators are only required to produce wire-frame prototypes for future projects. But O’Neill says that Adnaan Wasey, the head of POV Digital, insists participants produce something that can be posted online the day after the event. “It’s a fantastic challenge.” O’Neill says. “Hackathons are a perfect opportunity for photographers who want to dip their toes into interactive filmmaking.”</p>
<p>By the end of the POV Hackathon, they had a Web-based version of the first chapter of <em>Empire</em>. They used two screens to simultaneously tell two different stories, but with a single soundtrack tying the two together. While in the gallery installation, viewers could turn their heads from one story to another, the web-based version uses JavaScript to allow the viewer to flip between videos. <em><a href="http://www.pbs.org/pov/empire/">Empire: Cradle</a></em>, was the winning project at POV Hackathon.</p>
<p>Jongsma and O’Neill went on to create online versions of each of the remaining three chapters of <em>Empire</em>, each using slightly different designs to display parallel stories. <em>The Empire: Periphery</em> chapter, for example, features videos of two men on opposite sides of the world: One in Australia who may be descended from shipwrecked Dutch sailors believed to have fathered children with indigenous people; and one in California, who is living in a community of Dutch-Indonesians. The two videos are stacked on top of one another, with the bottom video playing upside-down. While the top video’s audio can be heard clearly, the bottom video’s audio is faint. Using the computer cursor, the viewer can spin the videos around, but the video on the bottom of the screen and its faint audio are an ever-present, constant temptation.  </p>
<p>Once Jongsma and O’Neill decide to add interactive elements to a project, their planning and production proceeds as they do on any other documentary. “We take pictures to find the best angles on the spaces where we’re shooting, and take a lot of notes,” Jongsma says. “From there, we storyboard and figure out how to enhance the story structurally and technically.” Rather than shaping a narrative with a beginning, middle and end, they are looking for parts that work together, creating complements and contrasts. She says, “It’s like you’re building the story not just horizontally but also vertically.” </p>
<p>The next challenge is to take the pieces and fit them all together while bearing in mind what they want the viewer to do. In an interview for PBS.org after their Hackathon win, Jongsma said, “The word ‘interactive’ in the context of online media shouldn’t just mean that you can press a button on a screen.” She explains that it’s not just about giving the viewer a path to follow, but thinking about how viewers might relate to a wealth of sometimes-complex information packed into the project. They ask themselves: “Do we want the viewer to be able to connect the dots him/herself? What level of participation makes sense?,” she explains, adding, “We try to make technology work for us, not the other way around.”</p>
<p>To use the best technology available, they’ve relied on collaboration. O’Neill notes, “When we started making <em>Empire</em>, I knew nothing about coding. Now I know very little about coding. That’s what we call progress.” They’ve turned to programmers with knowledge of programming languages such as JavaScript, Ruby, or C++, and collaborators familiar with programs and graphics engines such as Unreal Engine 4, Unity and Kolor AVP. These collaborations have been fruitful as well as encouraging, Jongsma says. “It’s thrilling to see your ideas take hold on the people you are collaborating with. It’s a snowball effect: You expand on each other’s creativity.”</p>
<p>Like <em>Empire</em>, <em>The Ark</em> will tell stories of people on different sides of the globe. It presents the perspectives of two groups, both involved in trying to save the last four northern white rhinos alive. “In San Diego, there’s a group of research scientists using stem cell technology to ‘genetically rescue’ the rhinos; and then, in the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, there’s a team of rangers who guard the last herd of rhinos from poachers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,” O’Neill explains. “There’s something beautiful about the juxtaposition of these two stories: Conservation by laboratory and gun.” He and Jongsma are currently raising funds to complete the project. </p>
<p>Looking beyond <em>The Ark</em>, Jongsma and O’Neill have recently announced a new project, <em>EXIT</em>, an interactive documentary for smartphones made in collaboration with PBS’s POV and Submarine Channel. “<em>EXIT</em> is a project about conquering your fear of the apocalypse. Can you think of a more apocalyptic platform than the smartphone, destroyer of relationships, wrecker of thumbs?” says O’Neill.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<em><a href="http://documentarystudies.duke.edu/books/new-releases/aunties">Aunties: The Seven Summers of Alevtina and Ludmila</a></em> is an 88-page photo book by Russian-born, Brooklyn-based photographer <a href="http://www.nadiasablin.com/">Nadia Sablin</a> published by the <a href="http://documentarystudies.duke.edu/">Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University</a> and <a href="http://www.honickmanfoundation.org/">The Honickman Foundation</a>. The book follows Sablin’s two elderly aunts as they go about their lives on a rustic farm—sewing clothes, sawing wood and tending their gardens.
<p>Sablin was born and raised in St. Petersburg, Russia. She remembers the modest apartment where four generations of her family resided under one roof, before her family emigrated to the United States amidst the collapse of the former Soviet Union. But it was the home her grandfather had built in a small village called Alekhovshchina, several hours north of St. Petersburg, that captured her childhood imagination.</p>
<p>“In the summers I would always spend at least a month in the village with my grandfather and one of my aunts and uncles,” Sablin recalls. All that came to an end when her family moved to Cleveland, Ohio, in 1992, when she was 12. She would not return to Russia until she was 28. The inspiration for the book first came during a trip to Ukraine when, trekking in the Carpathian Mountains with a friend, she came upon a small, bucolic settlement nestled in the hills. As she watched the villagers make cheese, Sablin remembered those summers spent in Alekhovshchina and knew she had to go back. </p>
<p>Although her grandfather had died, Sablin learned that her aunts, Ludmila and Alevtina, were still spending their summers together in the village. She visited them in 2008 and was enthralled the moment she entered the cabin. “When I walked in as a photographer, stooping to fit through the front door, I saw a place straight out of my childhood, as if I had traveled in time,” Sablin says. “It smelled the same, like pine cones burning in the samovar. The late-night setting sun slanted onto the same tablecloth that was there decades ago.” </p>
<p>For seven years Sablin returned to Alekhovshchina every summer, staying roughly two weeks each time. Early on, she tried to direct shots and pose scenes, but that way of working quickly proved untenable. “My aunts have a very regimented way of living; everything has to be done at a certain time,” Sablin explains. “I had to find a quicker way of working, something that wouldn’t interfere with their daily lives as much.” She gave up her “workhorse” Pentax 67II in favor of a Canon 5D Mark II. She learned to ignore her urge to “shoot everything,” and put the camera away more often. And while there were still some directed photographs, for the most part she tried to simply document their activities, anticipating where her shots might come, what angles to take, where her light would be. </p>
<p>And what light it was. During the summer months the sun does not set in Alekhovshchina until after midnight, due to the village’s northern location. “It’s the same light I remember as a child, and that’s something that sparks me,” Sablin says. It also helped that her grandfather, before electricity was available, built the house to maximize sunlight in each room throughout the day. Sablin followed Ludmila and Alevtina through their daily routines, as they followed the sun from room to room or worked outdoors.</p>
<p>In addition to posed portraits and photographs of her aunts doing things like gathering berries, working together on a crossword puzzle and ironing, Sablin made photographs of the landscape and home, and the small, often colorful details she noticed: spools of thread on a windowsill; worn garden tools; sheets hung out to dry.</p>
<p>Sablin stresses that this work is not intended to be an objective representation—it is as much about her memories, and fragments of a remembered past, as it is about the two women. </p>
<p>“I see only what I want to see and record only what touches me emotionally,” she explains. “That world is colored for me with childhood dreaming, reams of books read in the attic and light straight out of a fairy tale.”</p>
<p>By 2013, Sablin felt that she had enough material on Ludmila and Alevtina for a book. She put together a proposal, entered several photography contests and reached out to some of her favorite publishers, hoping something would stick. Her hustle paid off when she won <a href="http://firstbookprizephoto.com/about/">the 2014 CDS/Honickman First Book Prize in Photography</a>. The prestigious honor includes, along with a cash prize and exhibition, an opportunity for the winner to publish a book in conjunction with the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University and the Honickman Foundation. </p>
<p>Sandra S. Phillips, senior curator of photography at the <a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/">San Francisco Museum of Modern Art</a>, was the juror for the prize, and wrote the essay that appears in <em>Aunties</em>, which was designed by <a href="http://www.yocuomo.com/">Yolanda Cuomo</a>.</p>
<p>“I printed tiny prints and sequenced and re-sequenced for months before meeting with the editor, Alexa Dilworth from CDS, and Yolanda Cuomo, who also had their own preliminary edits,” Sablin says. She brought in quilts and lace made by her aunts for design inspiration. </p>
<p>“All the materials are based in some way on their creations,” she says. Sablin was impressed both by the efficiency with which the book was put together, and the respect Dilworth and Cuomo paid to her ideas and input. </p>
<p>Sablin considers <em>Aunties </em>her most complete work and attributes the attention it has garnered to the fact that “everyone has had a childhood.” When she took Ludmila and Alevtina early copies of the book, she hid some money inside each one. The two sisters accepted the gifts politely, but made no mention of the work for the rest of her two-week visit. But no sooner had she boarded a bus to St. Petersburg than her cell phone rang: Her aunts were decrying her gift, insisting they should be giving her money. “They were playing it cool, but as soon as I was out the door they ran for the books,” she laughs.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Over the past year, Brooklyn-based photographer <a href="http://www.francesfdenny.com/">Frances F. Denny</a> has launched a multi-track career in fine-art, editorial and commercial work. Radius Books will publish her first monograph, <em><a href="http://radiusbooks.org/books/frances-denny-let-virtue-be-your-guide/">Let Virtue Be Your Guide</a></em>, in early December. Meanwhile, she has been busy shooting for commercial clients including Chipotle Mexican Grill, online fashion retailer MM.LaFleur, and digital communications agency Logic &amp; Grace. Denny has also shot editorial assignments for <em>ArtReview, Architectural Digest, The Boston Globe</em>, and other publications. 
<p>“I realized that one practice could feed the other,” Denny says of pursuing both fine-art and commercial work. Commercial work supports her fine-art projects, she explains, and the different types of work satisfy different sides of her personality. “I’m an introvert at heart. I can be alone for days on end, working in the studio. But I also love collaboration” with clients. </p>
<p>The key to her success can be summed up in one word: networking. Nearly all of her assignments, as well as her book deal, have landed in her lap through her personal and professional connections. </p>
<p>She graduated from New York University in 2007 with a BA in a self-designed major that included a lot of feminist theory and women’s studies. Her liberal arts education informs her work creatively, but also taught her invaluable communication skills. “It’s essential to have strong writing skills. You have to be professional, and write in a way that’s clear, organized and expressive,” she says. </p>
<p>Immediately after college, she worked as an intern at a New York art gallery. When offered a job there as a receptionist, she quit. “I felt: I want to make work that’s hanging on these walls,” not answer the phones, she says. </p>
<p>Denny had always been interested in photography, and through her cousin Mary Blair Hansen (editor of the book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dash-Snow-Love-You-Stupid/dp/193892214X">Dash Snow: I Love You, Stupid</a></em>), Denny landed an internship in 2008 with photographer <a href="http://kavagorna.com/">Kava Gorna</a>, whose career balances fine-art and commercial photography. </p>
<p>After the internship, Denny took a summer course at <a href="http://www.mainemedia.edu/">Maine Media Workshops</a> that convinced her to devote herself to photography. </p>
<p>Back in New York, she began working as a darkroom assistant at the International Center of Photo and started meeting photographers. She also started studying the Web sites of photographers whose work she admired. She noticed that many had gone to art school, or had an MFA, or both. And many were able to teach because they had MFAs. “I liked the idea of doing commercial work. They were doing that. I liked the idea of teaching, too. But I had no technical experience, so I wasn’t getting assisting jobs beyond internships.” </p>
<p>She enrolled in <a href="http://www.icp.org/school/programs/general-studies-in-photography">ICP’s General Studies</a> program to get technical training. Just before graduation, she cast about for jobs. Through ICP she was introduced to a photographer she admired, <a href="http://hwhitaker.com/">Hannah Whitaker</a>, who had earned her MFA at ICP. Whitaker, an in-house photographer, hired Denny as her assistant at <em>W</em> magazine. In six months, Denny says, she learned from Whitaker most of what she knows about lighting and composition. She also observed how Whitaker— like Gorna—balanced assignments and fine-art work. </p>
<p>Denny enrolled at the Rhode Island School of Design in 2012. While there, she periodically assisted wedding photographer <a href="http://lucybrownarmstrong.com/">Lucy Brown Armstrong</a>, a family friend. By watching Armstrong work, Denny says, she learned valuable networking skills. For instance, Armstrong was good at meeting people at weddings, which often led to future gigs. </p>
<p>While at RISD, Denny was also starting to get assignments. “Some of them were big shoots for me at the time,” she says.</p>
<p>All of them were through personal connections. <em>ArtReview</em> hired her on a recommendation from a writer friend (and PDN contributor) Brienne Walsh to shoot a feature story about the New York art gallery scene. That led to another assignment for the magazine.</p>
<p><em>Architectural Digest</em> also called with an assignment. “They were doing a travel piece about Providence. A good friend of mine is a senior writer there. He pitched me as a photographer.” That assignment led to another for the magazine, shooting a portrait of a RISD textile artist.</p>
<p>Last summer, after she graduated, she got a small assignment from <a href="https://mmlafleur.com/">MM.LaFleur</a>, the online retailer specializing in business attire for women. The first assignment led to another, shooting a portrait of MM.LaFleur’s founder. “We got along. I met the whole team, and now I shoot for them all the time.”</p>
<p>MM.LaFleur was a start-up at that time. It has since grown rapidly, and Denny says she’s grown with it. Most of her assignments are for MM.LaFleur’s social media accounts and its online magazine called <a href="https://mmlafleur.com/mdash">The M Dash</a>. It features “interesting women doing interesting work,” Denny explains. “They hire me to shoot a lot of the profile [portraits] for them.”</p>
<p>MM.LaFleur editor-in-chief Tory Hoen says the company hires Denny frequently because of her style, her ability to make subjects comfortable in front of the camera, and her “ability to roll with the punches. We have to improvise as we go, and she’s up for that. She contributes at every level, including styling and scouting, and goes above and beyond her role as a photographer to help a shoot come together,” Hoen says.</p>
<p>Denny says she likes working with repeat clients. “They’re the best kind because you have a better sense of what works, what they expect, and they know what your strengths are.”</p>
<p>She has done some email promotions to expand her client base. But most of her work comes through word-of-mouth recommendations and networking, including people she meets on jobs.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot to be said for jobs leading to other jobs. If you do the job well, and get along with the client, that can lead to another job with them, and that’s great for both of you,” she says, noting that subsequent jobs may also require “a well-timed follow-up email or two.”</p>
<p>For instance, a subject she photographed for MM.LaFleur ended up going to work for <a href="http://www.logicandgrace.com/">Logic &amp; Grace</a>, giving Denny her “in” with that client. Last summer, she took an assignment to shoot promotional photos for the NoMad Bar in New York. The photos ended up on various food blogs, and architects <a href="http://www.stonehilltaylor.com/">Stonehill &amp; Taylor</a>, the designers of the bar, called Denny to shoot other projects they had done.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, her fine-art career has also been propelled by her networking. Denny started “Let Virtue Be Your Guide”—a project about her family—in 2010. She completed it while she was attending RISD, where she took a class about photo books from Thomas Palmer.</p>
<p>He invited Todd Bradway, formerly director of title acquisitions at D.A.P and now director of publishing at <a href="https://davidzwirnerbooks.com/">David Zwirner Books</a>, to talk to the class. Bradway liked Denny’s project, and asked her to keep in touch. She emailed him once the project was finished.</p>
<p>“He said, ‘This is a book,’” Denny recounts. Bradway put her in touch with David Chickey, the publisher, designer and editorial director of Radius Books, which will release <a href="http://radiusbooks.org/books/frances-denny-let-virtue-be-your-guide/">Denny’s first monograph this fall</a>. In the meantime, she’s contacting galleries for exhibitions and, she hopes, long-term representation.</p>
<p>Asked what advice she has for others trying to establish photography careers, Denny reeled off a list. First, she says, “Take any job that comes along, within reason. Just say yes to the job, and figure out how to shoot it later.”</p>
<p>Second, “Go to as many shoots as possible, and observe. You’ll learn a lot.”</p>
<p>Third, “Be good at pleasing clients. Write short, polite emails. Have clever ideas, and get ahead of problems,” by anticipating them and coming up with solutions.</p>
<p>Fourth, she says, “Outsource the things you need help with. You can’t do everything.”</p>
<p>And finally, “Never work for free. People will often ask you to work for free. I turn them down politely. [Doing that] is beneficial to you, and the rest of us” trying to make a living as photographers.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<strong>CLIENT:</strong> <a href="http://www.reebok.com/us/">Reebok</a>
<p>Viktoria Wallner, Head of Global Communications; Tori Scott, Art Buyer</p>
<p><strong>AGENCY: </strong><a href="http://www.mcgarrybowen.com/">McGarryBowen</a></p>
<p>Jeremy Lamin and Frauke Tiemann, Creative Directors</p>
<p>Commercial photographer <a href="http://www.ewanburns.com/">Ewan Burns</a> says he loves “filling the frame with information.” He explains, “To do that you have to be surrounded by activity,” and then seek out whatever activity or arrangement piques you attention. It’s a process that typically requires some preparation, but once he begins shooting, Burns works intuitively and spontaneously. An assignment that exemplifies his style is a shoot he did in 2011 for <a href="https://toughmudder.com/events/what-is-tough-mudder?gclid=CPiAkv-e8sgCFdePHwodumQARg">Tough Mudder,</a> which organizes competitive races over 10- to 12-mile obstacle courses. While other photographers were on the sidelines, using long lenses to photograph the competitors swinging on ropes or racing through muddy ditches, “I pretty much participated in the race,” the New York City-based photographer recalls. “I was getting into the mud, shooting really low so the lens was hovering over the mud.” Anywhere he turned, he could capture the action going on around him. </p>
<p>Burns compares his way of capturing moments in the midst of activity to “war photography without the war.” He has some familiarity with the genre. After serving in the British Army, Burns was looking for a new career. At the time, conflict and ethnic cleansing were raging in the former Yugoslavia, “and I thought it would be a good idea if I hitchhiked my way into the war.” After hitching rides across Europe, he talked his way onto a humanitarian flight heading into the midst of the conflict by claiming to be a photographer. On the ground, however, he quickly realized he didn’t have the mettle for conflict photography. “I have absolute respect for war photographers, and what it takes for a person to do that. I’m not that person.” He went back to school to study photography, then assisted commercial photographers in London and then Los Angeles, honing his skills at lighting, directing and meeting the needs of advertising clients. </p>
<p>Creatives at McGarry Bowen liked Burns’ Tough Mudder work, which he had licensed for stock usage and posted on his website. </p>
<p>The work convinced the agency he was the right photographer to shoot a Reebok campaign featuring Reebok-sponsored athletes during training sessions. Burns explains, “They liked the look of the caught moments I got, and the action all around.” Burns was given instructions not to use a tripod. “The athletes were always moving and I needed to be able to follow them like a social documentarian.” Burns warned the creatives that by relying on a run-and-gun shooting technique, “There would be a lot of failure” as well as a few shots that delivered the authentic intensity the client wanted.   </p>
<p><strong>Logistics</strong></p>
<p>During location scouting, Burns wanted to find a space that “looks interesting and artistic” and was big enough to accommodate the athletes’ training. The warehouse that was selected for the Los Angeles leg of the shoot had windows, but Burns was primarily shooting in the middle of the wide-open floor, so the natural light was insufficient to help him capture fast-moving action. “If you’re shooting live action you are shooting at a high shutter speed to cover action,” he explains. “The lights had to be enormous.”  </p>
<p>During the shoot, the athletes, who had been chosen by Reebok, were taking their cues from their trainer, not from the photographer. “I guess the trickiest part of the shoot was when I realized I couldn’t direct anybody,” Burns recalls. He enjoys directing, and typically starts a shoot by building camaraderie and getting members of his crew and his subjects to work as a team. On the Reebok shoot, however, the athletes were absorbed in carrying out their training, and ignored Burns. “They were separate from me because they had their own trainer, so I felt like I was on the outside,” he says. </p>
<p>He also had little chance to set up shots. At one point, when the athletes were taking a break from training, he had a group of them fan out in a hallway lit by sun from a skylight. He lay down on a dolly and, as the athletes ran towards him, his assistants pulled him backwards, allowing him to photograph from the middle of the running pack. During the rest of the shoot, however, he was moving around the gym, trying to anticipate what action the trainer would have the athletes move to next: “I’d get on the floor to get a photo and the person would jump up to move away.” </p>
<p>Energies he might have put into directing went instead into keeping up with his subjects. Says Burns, “I trained for this job because I knew it would be exhausting physically.”</p>
<p>At one point, Burns managed to get close to an athlete as he was lifting weights, and capture his concentration. Burns notes, “He’s working his butt off, but I captured him at a moment when he’s almost dropping the bar.”</p>
<p><strong>Lighting</strong></p>
<p>Burns made the shot of the weightlifter at high noon, so the Los Angeles sun is visible through the windows in the background. “What you can’t see is that there are HMIs behind me,” he says. Burns chose to use continuous lights to illuminate the entire floor at once: “I wanted to just be able to move and have light that always worked.” </p>
<p>He hired <a href="http://www.otmfc.com/front-page">OTMFC</a>, a lighting crew that brought a grip truck with a 500 amp generator and a variety of stands and lights. He set up a total of four Arri M18, 1800-watt HMIs on high rollers, so they could be easily moved as the action shifted. The lights were placed about eight feet off the floor, directed at a slight downward angle. He bounced the HMIs into 12-foot-wide square silks “to pour light into the area,” Burns says. He used a silver lame silk, “which gives a crisp, white light.”  </p>
<p>He notes that another, more time-consuming option would have been to light the space from above, by affixing HMIs to the ceiling of the training area. “But that would have given us less flexibility.” By clamping the lights and silks to high rollers, his crew was able to turn or move the lights if needed when the athletes moved to new training stations. </p>
<p><strong>Camera </strong></p>
<p>Burns shot with a Canon EOS-1D X and a 24-70 mm EF series f/2.8 lens, shooting 1/500th of a second at f/5.6, ISO 3200 for most of the shots in the gym. </p>
<p>Unable to shoot tethered, he shot to card, and he let clients preview shots on the back of his camera and on his digital tech’s monitor. He notes, “I think I’m oblivious that there are 16 people on the set behind me, and music blaring.” </p>
<p><strong>Post Production</strong></p>
<p>Burns estimates that from the eight-day shoot, he processed, color corrected and delivered roughly 4,000 images to the client, who then handled post-production.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[For photographers whose goal is to reach as many people as possible with their artwork, communication is key. In our feature <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/How-to-Pitch-Your-Photo-Book-to-Trade-Publishers-Susan-Middleton-s-Spineless-14681.shtml">“How and Why Photo Books Sell to a Wide Audience,"</a> artist Susan Middleton talks about her desire to reach a wide audience with her book <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1OSSbpx">Spineless: Portraits of Marine Invertebrates, the Backbone of Life</a></em>. An artist whose work focuses on animals and nature and frequently carries a conservation message, Middleton learned the importance of balancing artistry and accessibility while working for Richard Avedon. “He was a great portraitist but also a great advertising photographer,” she explains.
<p>During his career, Avedon worked in fashion, balancing esthetics and the need to highlight fashion designers’ latest offerings—and sell magazines—for <em>Harper’s Bazaar</em> and <em>Vogue</em>, where he was a staff photographer and shot every cover for more than two decades. As an advertising photographer, he created ads for Calvin Klein, Revlon and Levi’s, among many other commercial clients. But he also turned to serious subjects both on editorial assignments and in his personal work. He’s perhaps best-known for his straightforward portraits of people from all walks of life—the moneyed elite, counter-culture leaders, politicians, waitresses, slaughterhouse workers and drifters—using the same stark lighting and white seamless backdrop. The images invited viewers to meet face-to-face with Avedon’s subjects and examine them.</p>
<p>Middleton also wants to invite readers to engage with her subjects. “Not every artist creates work that is as accessible as mine,” she notes. Ambiguity is an important component of “a lot of really great art,” she points out, but it makes art more challenging and can limit an audience. Her more direct approach of isolating her subjects on seamless backgrounds helps her achieve her goals as an artist who also wants to educate and inform the public. “I like a very direct, literal approach to my subjects, though I do visually isolate them—so that’s somewhat non-traditional [in animal photography], although more people are doing that now,” she observes.</p>
<p>Middleton began developing her strategy when she and photographer <a href="http://www.liittschwager.com/">David Liittschwager</a>, another alum of Avedon’s studio, began working on <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1GTSolK">Here Today: Portraits of Our Vanishing Species</a></em>, their 1991 book of photographs of endangered animals. Avedon’s ability as both an artist and communicator influenced their work. “We were trying to make art, but we were also trying to make something that could communicate, with a strong impact, a conservations message about endangered species,” she recalls. “We learned from one of the advertising greats.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<strong>Client: </strong><a href="http://jasonmarkk.com/">Jason Markk</a>
<p><strong>Creatives: </strong>Anthony Cao, senior art director/head of marketing; Millie Rosas, special projects manager; Joe Le, art director</p>
<p>When creatives at Jason Markk, maker of high-end shoe-care products, wanted to advertise the company’s new stain repellent, they turned to photographer <a href="http://www.willdeleon.com/">Will Deleon</a> for ideas. Deleon, who is based in Los Angeles, has been shooting for the company since 2010, three years before he graduated from Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. Deleon started out shooting product shots for the company’s e-commerce site. “I established a good relationship with them, then the company started growing as my skills were growing,” says Deleon. After department stores began stocking Jason Markk products and the company opened its own flagship store, its marketing efforts expanded, and Deleon began shooting print, online and social media advertising. </p>
<p>Deleon describes the target demographic for Jason Markk products as “the sneaker head who spends hundreds or even thousands of dollars on their shoe collections.” Loyal customers provided the concept for the new campaign for <a href="http://jasonmarkk.com/shop/jason-markk-repel/">Repel</a>, a water and stain repellent. On <a href="https://instagram.com/jasonmarkk/">the brand’s Instagram feed</a>, fans described Repel as a “force field” protecting their sneakers. Deleon and the creatives began brainstorming ways to illustrate an invisible barrier around the spray canister, protecting it from splashing liquid. After he took several test shots of splashes made with paint, soda, and even caramel syrup, Deleon says, “The team decided to use water, to keep the classic, clean esthetic of the brand.” </p>
<p>Deleon’s still lifes are typically graphic, colorful and precisely lit, but the client wanted to showcase the clean, minimal design of the white Jason Markk canister. “They didn’t want to over-stylize it,” Deleon says. The creatives referenced images from his portfolio of white objects made of paper, including a paper airplane. “I defined the shape of the plane using gradients and light control, and the team wanted that same esthetic.” </p>
<p>To achieve the effect, he used a small number of diffused light sources. But as in all his still lifes, he used cards and reflectors to flag and direct light with precision. Clients may come to a shoot expecting more lights on the set, he says, “but it’s all about light control. I feel that if you bring in more lights, it just crowds things, especially when you’re shooting something small.” The technique is, Deleon says, efficient as well as effective. “Deadlines have gotten much shorter. Clients say, ‘Thanks for not spending eight hours on one shot.’”</p>
<p><strong>Logistics</strong></p>
<p>Deleon had made several test shots of splashes and pours. “Messing around with Plexiglas and water one day, I realized that when water meets Plexi, the Plexi disappears and the water takes the shape of the Plexi.” He went to a local plastics manufacturer and had them fashion a Plexiglas cylinder big enough to hold the Repel canister. “So, when we splashed the cylinder with the water, the Plexiglass would disappear and it would look like there was a force field around the canister.”</p>
<p>He suspended the cylinder vertically by clamping it to stands. To create his backdrop, he placed 4 x 8-foot piece of white acrylic about seven feet away from the cylinder. He put an inflatable kiddie pool under the product to catch the splashing water, and also covered the pool and his studio floor with a black tarp, so there were no colored reflections in the shiny white can or the acrylic. </p>
<p>Though he had planned to shoot as much as he could in camera, he discovered that when he hit the Plexiglas cylinder with a strobe, there was a yellowish tinge along one seam. He chose to photograph first the product alone, and then the cylinder as it was being splashed. In post, he removed the yellow seam, adjusted the color, and composited the product shot and the splash. </p>
<p>Before the shoot, Deleon and his assistant tried different ways of making splashes—adjusting the speed and the volume of the splash—before he decided that having his assistant hurl plastic cups of water worked best. He notes, “I made sure the same assistant who made the test was there for the shoot, because he had developed a feel for it: His arm was calibrated.” </p>
<p><strong>Lighting</strong></p>
<p>Deleon lit his set from back to front. Behind the acrylic backdrop, he placed two strobe heads. Positioned about five feet from the backdrop, the heads had 7-inch reflectors covered with diffusion material from Lee Filters, “because we wanted an even light spread on the background, with no hot spots.” These lights provided most of the illumination visible through the water splash. </p>
<p>To make sure spill from the background lights didn’t hit the product, he placed V-flats in front of the backdrop. “The only light we wanted on the product was the light we intended to have on it,” he says. To adjust his exposure, he put a stand-in product in front of the backdrop, he recalls, and checked: “How are my edges? Are they sharp?”</p>
<p>Once the cylinder was clamped to the stands, he set up his key lights. To camera right, he set up a Broncolor strobe, which he chose for its fast flash duration, with a medium-sized Broncolor strip box attached. He placed it behind a Lee Filter 250 Half White Diffusion material that he hung vertically, “to create a big, diffused light source and create the softness we were looking for.” At camera left, pointing down, he added a spot with a six-degree grid reflector, also shooting through a diffusion panel. Deleon explains, “That gave it that highlight near the top of the can” and added highlights to droplets of water. He had his strobes running on two Broncolor Scoro S 3200 packs, and dialed the power down to the lowest settings, “because the lower the intensity of power, the faster the flash duration.”  Setting the strobes to 1/6000 sec, he was able to freeze the splash.  </p>
<p>To throw some light back onto the bottom rim of the can, he says, he held a shiny bounce card just below the can. </p>
<p><strong>Camera</strong></p>
<p>Deleon used a Phase One 645DF camera with an IQ180 digital back and a 120mm f/4 macro lens. He exposed at 1/200 sec at f/11, ISO 100. Positioning himself four to five feet from the cylinder and product, he shot tethered while his digital tech, Yves Huy Trong, previewed the shots in Capture One for the clients. After Deleon and the creatives chose the best combination of product and splash, the photographer recalls, “We had a rough comp already by the time they left.”</p>
<p><strong>Postproduction</strong></p>
<p>“I do my own retouching whenever I can,” he says. “I guess I cling to my work, and feel like I should be the one retouching it.”</p>
<p>In addition to compositing the splash and the product, he color-corrected everything, making sure the purple logo on the can matched the brand’s specifications. His client liked one particular splash shape and decided to have him clone and mirror it on the other side of the canister. “With the water the only other tweaking I did was to warp the splash a bit and give it a little more contrast in post.”</p>
<p>The client planned to use the shot online, on Instagram, in out-of-home and in other print advertising, so Deleon delivered a 16-bit, 300-layered TIFF. The files he provided, Deleon says, “gave the client the latitude to move the splash and add type.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<a href="http://carolynrusso.com/">Carolyn Russo</a> has worked with the <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/">Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum</a> since she graduated from the Massachusetts College of Art and Design in 1988. In her current job as a photographer and museum specialist, she acquires new art for the museum and curates exhibits. The unique position has also given her a platform for publishing and exhibiting her own work, while the demands of her job mean that her personal projects take years to realize. Russo wouldn’t have it any other way. “I think my projects need that time. It’s kind of like cooking, where something needs to simmer to absorb all the flavors,” she muses.
<p>Russo’s newest project is <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1GT6GDr">Art of the Airport Tower</a></em>, a 176-page hardcover monograph being published by Smithsonian Books this month. The book coincides with <a href="http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/airport-towers/">an exhibition at the National Air and Space Museum</a> that runs from November 2015 to November 2016. </p>
<p>The project was born in a moment aboard a 2006 flight into New York City, when Russo noticed something for the first time. “I was coming through LaGuardia and when the airport tower came into view, I thought, ‘Holy crap, that tower looks like Swiss cheese,’” Russo recalls. “At that time I was seeing and photographing aircraft as abstractions, so it was a natural transition into the airport tower project.” Another inspiration, Russo says, was <a href="http://hirshhorn.si.edu/collection/sugimoto/#collection=sugimoto&amp;detail=http%3A//hirshhorn.si.edu/bio/hiroshi-sugimoto/">a Hiroshi Sugimoto exhibit</a> of blurry and ethereal photographs of skyscrapers she saw at the Hirshhorn Museum.</p>
<p>Russo put the idea on the back burner as she finished up other projects, until a serendipitous encounter at a Smithsonian function set the project in motion. She was seated next to someone who had “FAA” written on his nametag. “I asked him if he knew who I could speak with for permission to photograph towers and he said with a smile, ‘Aaaahhh, that would be me,’” she remembers. “It turned out I was talking to the Acting Administrator at the FAA.”</p>
<p>Through the FAA, Russo gained access to all of the commercial towers in the United States. She started locally, photographing towers on the eastern seaboard that she could easily reach from her home in Washington D.C. When traveling for personal vacations or professional speaking engagements, Russo would plan ahead and find a way to shoot some towers. She also traveled to 23 countries and, by her own estimate, photographed at least 100 air traffic control towers for the project. Each country had its own permissions process, some more byzantine than others. Dubai, for instance, would not consider any permission requests until she actually arrived in the country. Certain airports required a life insurance certificate worth $20 million for her to shoot on the tarmac. In one nation, Russo was required to show all her images to wary local authorities before leaving the airport. But even that encounter ended with the kind of jovial camaraderie that, in her experience, is typical of flight culture. </p>
<p>Logistics were just one part of the puzzle; financing the project was its own winding odyssey. She received some funds from the Smithsonian raised from her department’s book royalties, honorariums, and a traveling exhibition of a previous body of work. (Federal tax dollars were not used to fund the project, she notes.) </p>
<p>Russo’s search for her subjects was exhaustive; she spent countless hours researching prospective towers online and in the Smithsonian library. She attended Air Traffic Control Association conferences, and followed up on any leads that came her way. She soon settled on two different criteria: For the contemporary towers Russo focused on esthetics and architecture, but with the older towers, like the Ford Island Control Tower at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, she looked for historical significance. </p>
<p>Russo approached photographing the towers the same way she might approach a series of portraits, trying to highlight the building’s individual traits and capture its physical presence. “I was interested in their beauty and tried to capture their power. I saw them as the choreographer/conductor for the dance of the aircraft at the airport. Of course I was focusing on the architecture, but I wanted more than that out of them,” she says. </p>
<p>When shooting the contemporary towers, she pushed towards abstraction, isolating and decontextualizing design elements. Thus the LaGuardia tower is transfigured into an alien craft, and she rendered the facility at Stockholm Arlanda as twinned cylinders, without beginning or end. But with the historical towers, Russo wanted to present them in a more straightforward, documentary style, as “eyewitnesses to history,” as she puts it.</p>
<p>Initially, Russo worked with a variety of cameras: An analogue Hasselblad, a digital Hasselblad and a DSLR. She found the back-and-forth inefficient and decided to stick with her digital cameras. “Sometimes you had 15 minutes [to shoot], sometimes you had an hour, and I didn’t want to spend that time juggling cameras instead of focusing on the tower,” she explains. She shot most of the project with a Nikon D3 and Nikon D4, often using her smartphone’s camera to “sketch things out” before she started.</p>
<p>In addition to the book, <a href="http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/airport-towers/">“Art of the Airport Tower” will also open as a traveling Smithsonian exhibit in November 2015</a>. The exhibit consists of 50 images, selected from the 100 that make up the book. Russo curated it with a focus on the contemporary towers, grouping the historical towers together, as she does in the book.  </p>
<p>The last towers Russo shot were part of the world’s first remotely operated air-traffic control system in Sweden. The unmanned tower located at &Ouml;rnsk&ouml;ldsvik Airport is linked to the LFV Remote Tower Centre 76 miles away in Sundsvall, where human controllers are able to monitor all traffic on a 360-degree LCD screen. Part of Russo’s motivation in shooting historical towers was to call for their preservation, so there is a certain symmetry to this glimpse of the future of air traffic control. </p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[For many DSLR filmmakers, the phrase “8K” may seem more than a wee bit premature. But it’s a testament to how fast video technology is changing that at least one of the video editing programs in our roundup is supporting the resolution, even as other products are adding compatibility with 4K formats. 
<p><strong>Apple Final Cut Pro X</strong></p>
<p>Among people who care about such things, the introduction of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12">Final Cut Pro X</a> several years ago was deeply polarizing, with key features being dropped in favor of delivering a simpler, more consumer-friendly program. Now on version 10.2 (or is that X.2?) Apple hasn’t done a complete about-face, but continues to build upon the reconceived video editor with new features that will appeal to pros and enthusiasts alike. Among the new features is 3D titling with drag-and-drop functionality, along with 3D title templates with built-in backgrounds and animations. For color-grading and effects work, Apple improved Final Cut’s masking features, allowing users to save shape masks as presets for later use. You can now view up to four video scopes simultaneously in Final Cut to guide color grading and corrections. Several new video formats are supported in the program as well, including Panasonic’s AVC-Ultra and Sony’s XAVC-S. RED camera users will also enjoy GPU-accelerated transcoding, playback and rendering for RAW files  from RED cameras.</p>
<p><strong>PRICE: </strong><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12">$300</a></p>

<p><strong>Blackmagic Design DaVinci Resolve STUDIO 12</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://adorama.evyy.net/c/124294/51926/1036?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fbmdvrs.html">Resolve 12</a> packs in more than 80 new features, tackling everything from media management to color grading. Moving deeper into editing, the updated Resolve Studio can now cut programs from multiple video sources in real time, syncing camera angles based on time code, audio waveforms or in/out points. The audio engine has also been revamped to offer higher sampling rates and better real time playback (including reverse playback and slow motion scrubbing). Media management tools now include a “smart bin” function that displays footage based on metadata tags for easier retrieval. DaVinci’s core strength, color grading, wasn’t neglected. There’s a new curves interface plus automatic color matching between two or more clips in addition to new tools for creating smart filters. To speed things along, Resolve Studio supports Intel Iris and Pro GPUs and can create customizable media proxies for RAW and high-resolution video files.</p>

<p><strong>Red Giant Magic Bullet Suite 12</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1M6piY3">Red Giant’s Magic Bullet Suite 12</a> updates most of the company’s color-correction and color-grading tools. Among the major enhancements is GPU acceleration for several of the suite’s plug-ins to deliver real-time color correction without leaving a smoldering ruin where your CPU used to be. Magic Bullet Looks, the suite’s film looks and color-correction tools, gains 198 presets derived from popular films and TV shows. Suite 12 marks the introduction of Magic Bullet Film, a film emulator that the company says mimics “the entire photochemical process” from film negative to grading, grain and print stock. Magic Bullet Film includes 22 negative stocks and four print stocks to choose from. The color-grading tool Colorista III also gets a new user interface plus the ability to leverage Adobe’s masking and tracking features. The Mojo 2.0 colorizer enjoys a 20-percent speed boost with GPU acceleration in Adobe Premiere and an 80 percent bump in Apple Final Cut Pro. It also gains the ability to render effects in near-real-time. Magic Bullet’s skin touch-up tool, Cosmo 2.0, joins the GPU acceleration parade, gaining a 20 percent speed bump in Adobe products and for the first time gets compatibility with Final Cut Pro X and Sony Vegas. Magic Bullet Suite 12’s tools are all fully compatible with Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro, while host support for Final Cut Pro X, Avid and other editors will vary depending on the plug-in in question.</p>

</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adobe Premiere CC</strong></p>
<p>As part of its 2015 Creative Cloud release, Adobe supercharged the color-grading capabilities of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html">its marquee video editor</a>. The so-called Lumetri Color panel blends the color-grading and correction capabilities that Adobe had earlier introduced in its SpeedGrade plug-in with Lightroom-style tools such as sliders for white balance, exposure, tone and tint. From the Lumetri panel, you can select presets (or “Looks”) to quickly apply an effect across your frame. If you need still more fine-tuning, you can send the project directly into SpeedGrade. Also new to Premiere is Morph Cut, which helps intelligently eliminate jump cuts between sound bites through a combination of facial tracking and frame interpolation. Premiere is now integrated into the Adobe Stock marketplace so you can add assets from the Stock portfolio into your work with just a few clicks. Adobe’s Mercury Engine, which boosts the performance of the editor on PCs and Macs, has been updated to improve Premiere’s playback on high-resolution external displays.</p>

<p><strong>NewBlue Stylizers 3 </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://adorama.evyy.net/c/124294/51926/1036?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2FNBSYLUL.html">Packed with 250 presets and up to 23 plug-ins</a>, NewBlue’s Stylizer lets you add effects to your video that run the gamut from subtle to cartoonish. You can create flicker, airbrush a scene, simulate motion or get more surreal with effects such as halovision and impressionist. You can separate your video into individual red, green and blue color channels for making more precise adjustments. Stylizers 3 is completely GPU-accelerated thanks to support for Native CUDA, OpenCL and OpenGL graphics engines. It’s also resolution-independent, so it can tackle files from standard definition to 4K and beyond. Stylizers 3 is compatible with all the major editors as well as DaVinci Resolve.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="http://adorama.evyy.net/c/124294/51926/1036?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2FNBSYL3.html">$94 (4 plug-ins)</a>; <a href="http://adorama.evyy.net/c/124294/51926/1036?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2FNBSYL3EL.html">$199 (Elite, 9 plug-ins)</a>; <a href="http://adorama.evyy.net/c/124294/51926/1036?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2FNBSYLUL.html">$284 (Ultimate, 23 plug-ins)</a> </p>

<p><strong>FilmConvert</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://filmconvert.com/">FilmConvert</a> capitalizes on our insatiable desire to imbue digital files with the grainy, textured look of film. The program contains well over a dozen film stock presets, including motion picture films such as Kodak Vision 3 250D and Fuji Vivid 8543, as well as still films such as Ilford Delta 400 and Kodak Tri-X 400. It supports cameras from GoPros to Alexas and delivers several slider-based tools for tweaking color, grain, and luminosity. Three color wheels are also on hand to tackle shadows, midtones and highlights. You can select negative sizes to increase or decrease grain—smaller negative sizes yield a larger grain, while larger negative sizes produce smaller grain. FilmConvert is available as a stand-alone program or as a plug-in for the major video editors, including Adobe Premiere, Final Cut Pro and Sony Vegas, as well as Photoshop. The Mac edition of the stand-alone software now compensates for color/gamma shifts when viewing files on different platforms. The Premiere plug-in was also recently updated to support Adobe’s Mercury Playback Engine as well as CUDA GPU processing when using supported NVIDIA graphics cards—a pair of improvements that should speed editing when working with FilmConvert in Premiere. </p>
<p><strong>PRICE: </strong><a href="http://filmconvert.com/download/default.aspx">Price: $99 (Photoshop); $199 (standalone or individual video plug-in); $299 (plug-ins for all video editors)</a></p>

<p><strong>Sony Vegas Pro 13</strong></p>
<p>With <a href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro">version 13</a>, Vegas Pro users can leverage the new Connect iPad app for remote collaboration. Using the app, remote users can jointly write comments on footage in tandem with a desktop user in real-time. They can also place frame-accurate markers and notes directly in the timeline as well as start/stop/pause video playback, all using a gesture-based interface. An offline mode lets creatives download proxy files to their tablet to mark up, with changes syncing to the project once the iPad is back online. Also new for version 13 is a multi-tool feature that collects frequently used editing tools into a pop-up box below the timeline for streamlined access. As with any new release, there’s been under-the-hood tweaks to improve performance, including the addition of an XAVC Intra Smart Render function that reduces rendering times when using templates. There are seven new video effects from FXHOME integrated into the program that leverage the OpenGL standard to accelerate rendering. </p>

<p><strong>Avid Media Composer </strong></p>
<p>While many videographers and filmmakers are easing into the 4K era, Avid is looking eagerly ahead to 8K with <a href="http://shop.avid.com/ccrz__ProductDetails?sku=%23DYNA12345">version 8.4 of Media Composer</a>. The newest version supports video resolutions up to a maximum of 8192x8192-pixels in frame rates up to 60 fps—specs that will have TV marketers licking their chops. These video project dimensions are customizable from 256x128 pixels on up to 8K, with an option to save your dimensions as presets for quicker retrieval. According to Avid, these super high-resolution files won’t grind your existing PC to dust provided you’ve met the minimum specs, such as 32GB of RAM for 4K editing. The newest version also adds native support for Sony’s XAVC-I codec as well as ProRes 2K, 4K and UltraHD formats. You can also mix-and-match these codecs with others from Canon, Panasonic and Avid’s own DNxHR codec in the editing timeline without impairing real-time playback. Version 8.4 delivers quicker timeline searching through a new Timeline Quick Find feature. You can use the Quick Find field to type in queries as well as access a drop-down menu to sort your search according to visible timeline text, resolution, clip name, comments and more.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[International coverage of Venezuela’s social and political breakdown has focused on street protests, and lays blame for the country’s problems on the policies of its left-wing government, says photographer <a href="http://nataliekeyssar.com/splash">Natalie Keyssar</a>. But after visiting the country in 2014, she says she found the narrative of the international media “way over-simplified,” and decided to spend time exploring the story herself.
<p>Keyssar eventually pitched a story to MSNBC.com, and landed a week-long assignment last February to return to Caracas. The resulting story, called <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/post-chavez-venezuela-one-country-divided-two#slide1">“Post-Chavez Venezuela: one country, divided in two,”</a> featured a number of diptychs juxtaposing scenes from rich and poor neighborhoods of the capital city. It was published in early March, to coincide with the second anniversary of the death of Hugo Chavez, Venezuela’s much loved (and hated) former president.</p>
<p>“It highlighted the inequality, which is a big issue for us,” says MSNBC.com senior photo editor Elissa Curtis, who gave Keyssar the assignment. “And it was a chance to look at how democracy is working in Venezuela” under the leadership of Chavez’s hand-picked successor, Nicol&aacute;s Maduro.</p>
<p>Keyssar said she got interested in the story after reading Spanish-language news accounts of the unrest. She was struck by how impassioned the government opposition seemed. “Ultimately, the protagonists are the upper class youth. What does it mean when the comfortable classes of a country are rising up against what’s supposed to be a leader who represents the poor?” she says. </p>
<p>Keyssar made the first trip on her own dime. She planned to stay a week, but ended up staying for several weeks. The more she saw, she says, “the more I realized how little I knew. No sentence could sum up the political situation. There are tons of overlapping realities, depending on who you speak to.”</p>
<p>The poor loved Chavez because of his policies of economic redistribution. They blamed the wealthy for their privations, accusing them of hoarding all the country’s wealth and resources. The wealthy hated Chavez, blaming him for ruining the Venezuelan economy. They also blamed the poor for runaway crime—including robbery, kidnapping and murder—that has forced the wealthy to live under guard behind fortified walls.</p>
<p>“This was a story with no heroes. I came quickly to fall in love with the Venezuelan character,” Keyssar says. “I couldn’t take a side. I was forced to be neutral by how complex all of the issues are. At the same time, I came to really care about so many of the individuals I interacted with, from hardcore government supporters to the hardcore opposition.”</p>
<p>She made a second trip to Venezuela last fall, and started spending time with people on both sides of the political divide to try to understand the roots of the strife. She found it easy to meet members of the opposition movement at street protests. A lot of them became close friends, she says.</p>
<p>Meeting government supporters was a bit more difficult, but not much, Keyssar says. “What I found again and again is that if you approach people with open hands and honesty about your intentions” they will welcome you and open up, she says. “I was super curious about Tupamaro”—an allegedly violent far-left pro-government group—“because there’s a lot of fear of them.”</p>
<p>Against the advice of her friends in Caracas, Keyssar went to a Tupamaro rally, found their spokesperson, and introduced herself. “I said, ‘Hi, I’m Natalie. I’m interested in your organization. I’m an American. I’m a freelancer. Can we talk?’ She gave me her phone number and we set up a meeting.”</p>
<p>Keyssar says the point was to meet and spend time with people across the political spectrum, including the most radical. The challenge was the street crime. Caracas, she says, “is another level of danger” compared to other places she’s worked. And the fear isn’t just theft of your cameras, but “the fear you might get killed over your gear,” she says.</p>
<p>“You can’t walk around with a camera out unless you’re very calculated and have someone watching your back. You have to shoot behind closed doors, or make sure people in power in a certain area are vouching for you. The biggest frustration is that you always need to be considering security in a way that can be sort of limiting.” </p>
<p>Keyssar relied on her network of local contacts to move around. Despite the social chaos, she says, Venezuelans are eager to help even strangers. Whenever she told someone she was interested in going to a new place, she’d eventually be introduced to someone who would offer to escort her by motorbike. “It’s part of the culture, and it’s what I love about [Venezuela].”</p>
<p>Keyssar shot with a Canon EOS 5D, two prime lenses (35- and 50mm) and a Canon Speedlite flash. “I wanted the work to have that hot white Caribbean sun feeling I associate with Caracas, and I used flash sometimes to make sure that [look] would be uniform throughout,” she says.</p>
<p>She avoided the most sensational images, which tend to be polarizing, she says. She also took advantage of her freedom to go beyond straight reportage. MSNBC, she explains, is “willing to combine literal, traditional photojournalism with something that’s more about a feeling.... This project was about a level of tension that you can’t necessarily take a literal picture of.”</p>
<p>Curtis’s suggestion to think in terms of diptychs was also freeing, Keyssar says. “I started to see the images as fragments of a phrase, as opposed to needing the photograph to always be a complete phrase. It gives you a few more notes to play. By mixing diptychs with single images, it gives me an opportunity to be more specific with what I want to say.”</p>
<p>The story opens with a tight shot of a crying eye on a billboard, juxtaposed with a photograph of a man standing halfway in shadow, halfway in light. “The pairing was Elissa’s, but it’s so evocative of the tension and darkness and sadness I feel in Caracas right now,” Keyssar says.</p>
<p>Another image, shot in a poor barrio where violence and murder are common, shows a young girl half-hiding behind a chair. It is juxtaposed with an image of a house in a wealthy neighborhood, behind a wall and barbed wire. “You look at these two photos together and it’s a real conversation about what protection and safety means and what money can buy,” Keyssar says.</p>
<p>Her concern while she was shooting the story was that one side or the other would feel unfairly portrayed in the end. “The purpose was to create questions and dialogue, not point fingers, and I felt my contacts from both sides of the equation got that and were comfortable with how they were portrayed,” she says.</p>
<p>“You’re highlighting these differences, but you’re trying to do it in a way that’s subtle and non-judgmental and honestly neutral because the idea is to make people on both sides see the other side as a little bit more human.”</p>
<p>Because the future of Venezuela remains so uncertain, Keyssar says she expects to return to continue telling the story. “There’s going to be a lot of change, hopefully for the good, and I want to see it.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[A little more than a year ago, <em>National Geographic</em> veterans Bill Douthitt and Beth Rakouskas joined <em><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/">Science</a></em> <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/">magazine</a>, a 135-year old publication that is half news magazine, half peer-reviewed science journal. Rakouskas, the design director, and Douthitt, the senior photo editor, were brought on as part of an initiative to improve the magazine’s visuals and more thoroughly integrate the art department into the process of telling compelling stories to readers. <em>PDN</em> spoke with Douthitt and Rakouskas about the magazine’s new look and their goals for the magazine’s photography. 
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: You two are both relatively new to <em>Science</em>. What brought you here, and where is it going?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bill Douthitt: </strong>Coming in, the organization, about a year prior, had made a pretty serious commitment of resources to becoming more of a multi-platform, multimedia type of publication, not just a print magazine and a website. They hired a couple of folks whom Beth and I had worked with previously at <em>National Geographic</em>: Tim Appenzeller, the head of the news writing department, and Rob Covey, who is the chief digital media officer.</p>
<p>We talked with both of them about the desire to transform things. Speaking just for myself, I was brought in to bring in higher quality photography, whether it was from existing sources such as agencies like Corbis or Alamy or whomever, or from individual photographers, or doing something that hadn’t been done too much here: to assign people. My brief was to improve the look of the covers, the features and the special sections.</p>
<p><strong>Beth Rakouskas: </strong>There was a big push, and it was all the way from the top, where they were willing to put the money and the resources, the energy, everything, towards really transforming not only the look of the magazine and the website, but just the way that we operate so that it was going digital first. They created this position—prior to me having this job there was an art director, rather than a design director, and it was only print. My role is both print and digital media. They completely reorganized many groups within <em>Science</em>, taking people from all different areas and creating this digital media team to best re-focus our efforts. And when I heard that Bill had been hired, I knew that they were serious about making a change. They wouldn’t bring on a top-tier photo editor to a place that didn’t care about the photography.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What’s different now about the photography in the magazine?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BD: </strong>We did a special issue on the 100th anniversary of [the theory of] general relativity two months ago, and one of the things that involved was a gigantic gravity-wave detector in Louisiana. We really couldn’t do the kind of picture I wanted to do from the ground or from a helicopter, because I wanted something that was about 50–75 feet off the ground. So I hired a drone company to do the picture. Once we got that I sat down with the head of our multimedia group, we talked about what could we do with the drone, and how could we have some fun with that on a video scale as well. It’s just a matter of coordination, but we were able to produce a point of view of that gravity wave detector that had not been done before, a low, wide-angle shot of this thing that has these two gigantic arms that go off at 90 degrees at the end of the forest. </p>
<p>There was <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/latin-america/2015/06/feature-deep-peru-s-rainforests-isolated-people-emerge">a story about one of the recently contacted tribes found in the Amazon</a>, so in that case the writer got some support from the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting to go down and look at some of the issues with recently contacted indigenous people. So we were able to send a photographer <a href="http://www.jasonhouston.com/about-jason-houston">Jason Houston</a>, to go along. This is stuff that hadn’t happened before. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: You’re a weekly. How many assignments in each week are you doling out? Is it a mix between pickup and assignments?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BD:</strong> It really varies. There are weeks when I won’t assign anything because the nature of the features is either more graphically driven or it just makes more sense to rely on existing imagery for whatever reason. On the other hand, for the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6246.toc">July 24, 2015 issue on ancient DNA</a>, I think we did either four assignments or five, but there was quite a bit of assigned work in that because I was after a certain kind of look to make what was really a story about bones as interesting as possible.  If we’re doing a profile of someone, more often than not we will assign those, because we want a fresh picture that has some personality to it. We want something that is storytelling in its own right.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What ethos or esthetic are you trying to achieve? What informs the visual esthetic of the book?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BR: </strong>Accuracy. </p>
<p><strong>BD: </strong>Beth is saying that light-heartedly, but I think that’s really true. This is a very well-educated, scientifically well-versed audience, and accuracy becomes a really big deal. What you’re showing is really relevant to whatever the thrust of the text is. </p>
<p>I think it’s just about achieving a great deal of clarity and impact in the visual side of communication. We were looking at some of the earlier presentations from a year or so back and what strikes me is how much cleaner and clearer and more immediate everything has become. You can navigate your way through information more readily with the kinds of visuals and display that we’re putting into effect here.</p>
<p><strong>BR:</strong> Now we’re adding to the story, rather than just doing point pictures that are completely the same as the text. We try to sell that way of thinking to the editorial side, that we’re bringing more to the table than just saying “This is the first thing you’re talking about, and this is what they look like.” When we do a profile, like <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/people-events/2015/05/king-pills">“The King of Pills,” Ray Schinazi, shot by Michael Schwarz</a>, it’s not just a straight portrait, or something that we took from an annual report. It’s giving the feeling of who this guy is. It has personality to it.</p>
<p><strong>BD: </strong>We did a piece on ancient DNA, and the opening spread shows a human leg bone. That was actually found in a river in Siberia in 2008, and it has the oldest human DNA that has yet been found. That didn’t actually get into the text, but it was a terrific visual, so I talked to the text editor and said it could be a wonderful way to start it. It was back in Siberia, and I was able to get Alexander Maklakov, a photographer in that area who could photograph it with the right sort of light to give it a nice sheen and make it an attractive opening piece.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you find photographers to assign work to?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BD: </strong>We rarely have the budget as you would with <em>National Geographic</em>, where you just send somebody somewhere. I tend to work very location-based, and sometimes I’ll get a reference from a friend of mine who’s a picture editor, but more often than not I’m looking at the various aggregated sites for photographers or simply looking at websites of local photographers. I’ve been using <a href="https://blink.la/">Blink</a> and things like <a href="https://wonderfulmachine.com/">Wonderful Machine</a>. </p>
<p>Quite often I’m hiring someone I’ve never worked with before, but they have the right set of skills for whatever it is that we’re doing, and they’re reasonably close to wherever the assignment is. That’s more the typical route than hiring someone like <a href="http://portfolio.joemcnally.com/">Joe McNally</a>. I was Joe’s picture editor for virtually all of his stuff at <em>Geographic</em>, so we know each other rather well, and I will bring him in when I need something that is technically demanding, like the “Building a Better Mouse” cover from the October 3, 2014 issue.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What kind of skills are you looking for?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BD: </strong>Generally, I’m looking for a journalistically skilled photographer, because most of our assignments have a journalistic component to them and I want someone who’s used to working in a situation that is sometimes full of surprises, can work quickly and has the necessary technical skills for lighting. But it’s very location-driven. We’re also doing things that are outside the U.S. We had a cover on Cuba, and Maggie Steber, a friend of mine who’s worked in Cuba a lot recommended <a href="http://www.lisettepoole.com/">Lisette Poole</a>, an American photographer working in Cuba right now. She did some really beautiful portraits of Cuban scientists the writer had interviewed. A lot of times, it’s reaching out and finding someone that I don’t know, but who is in the right place and has the right skills.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How can a photographer get your attention?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BD: </strong>Send me a link. That’s the way it goes. It’s really dependent on if I have something going on where you are. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Your website is undergoing a redesign. What will that entail, and how will it affect the photography you publish?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BR:</strong> It has not launched yet. We’re hoping by early fall. It will definitely be a visual refresh, but the goal is that we will have more functionality, more capability, in terms of better use of slideshows and video and getting interactive graphics and other sorts of visual storytelling components in there. It doesn’t always go exactly how you plan right off the bat, so it’s going to be an evolution. But that is definitely the goal. </p>
<p>One thing that we did with our multimedia team: They took a researcher’s video of a process of 3D printing, three months after we published the research paper [<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6228/1349.abstract">“Continuous liquid interface production of 3D objects,” March 20, 2015</a>] in the magazine. They did a voiceover and put some branding on it, reposted it and posted it on social. It reached more than 10 million people and pushed over 100,000 people back to the paper. That’s just one of the models our video team is pursuing. With that success, each week we’re trying to find researcher-driven video, or if possible, commission the video, give a little context for how it is applicable to the paper and then have it link back and drive traffic to the research.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Is an active website the secret to landing a photography book deal? Publishers see thousands of book proposals each year. Convincing them to take a chance on an unknown photographer or a unique topic is a challenge that many fail. Spending time cultivating your social media presence and connecting with viewers interested in your work can draw a publisher’s attention, show proof of interest in your style and subjects, and assist with the marketing and sales of your book after publication. Here are two examples of photographers who found success turning the work they showcased online into photo books.
<p><strong>Matthew Christopher</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Abandoned America: The Age of Consequences</strong></em></p>
<p>Commercial photographer <a href="http://matthewchristopherphotography.com/">Matthew Christopher</a> started documenting the various derelict buildings that exist across America more than a decade ago. Initially drawn to abandoned medical facilities while researching the decline of the state hospital system, Christopher soon turned to photographing factories, churches, prisons and schools. “There is something magical and mysterious about spaces that are no longer in use, where nature and time and man’s presence have combined to create something absolutely unique,” explains Christopher. He created his website, <a href="http://www.abandonedamerica.us/">abandonedamerica.us</a>, in 2006, and he began sharing his work on Facebook and other social networks in 2009. In addition to posting new photos, he talks about each  location and his process, and answers viewers’ questions. Thanks to a fascination with urban archaeology and to the usefulness of his tips and information, the website sees more than 700,000 pageviews each month, and he has close to 230,000 followers on various social networks.</p>
<p>Christopher wasn’t initially successful in pitching Abandoned America to book publishers. But his active Facebook presence caught the eye of French imprint <a href="http://www.jonglezpublishing.com/en/">Jonglez Publishing</a>. Once he had the publisher’s attention, the quality of his work shone through. “I discovered Matthew’s work on Facebook. We had already published books on the same subject with Belgian photographers and I was looking for other photographers on the same subject,” recalls publisher Thomas Jonglez. “His work stood out due to the quality of his pictures but also, which I discovered later on, due to the quality of his analysis and of his texts. His social media presence was a positive factor (especially for promotion/marketing) but the real positive was the quality of his work.”</p>
<p>Jonglez Publishing issued <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Abandoned-America-The-Age-Consequences/dp/2361950944">Abandoned America: The Age of Consequences</a></em> in October 2014. Like Christopher’s website, the book includes historical information on each site. The mix of visuals and historical detail attracted press coverage in <em>The Telegraph, Los Angeles Times</em>, the websites of ABC News and NBC News and in travel and design publications. </p>
<p>Like Smith, Christopher strongly believes that the size and loyalty of his online audience was crucial to getting his book published. “Absolutely, who knows whether that would have happened otherwise. There are a lot of smaller publishers out there these days who are calculating the risk they are taking in publishing an author or photographer by the amount of marketing that author will do for them and their established audience.” </p>
<p>Having an engaged online audience was a boon for Christopher in promoting the book, not just in selling it to a publisher. “Much of the push in marketing now falls on an author. If someone is really motivated to go out there and connect their work with people, then they are going to do much better than an author who doesn’t understand that the success or failure of their publication rests on how creative they are in getting people to look at it,” Christopher says. </p>
<p>The photographer is currently working on a second book, which he hopes to publish in 2016.</p>

<div><strong>Victoria Smith</strong></div>
<div><em><strong>See San Francisco: Through the Lens of SFGirlbyBay </strong></em></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Photographer, photo stylist, former art buyer and journalist <a href="http://www.sfgirlbybay.com/about/">Victoria Smith</a> started posting photos and thoughts on decorating on <a href="http://www.sfgirlbybay.com/">sfgirlbybay.com</a> in 2006 as a fun hobby. “I didn’t really decide to start a blog—it kind of chose me, so there were really no goals involved and certainly not [thoughts of] a book.” Smith explains, “It was never meant to be my ‘day job.’” Showcasing her “bohemian modern style,” with photos of her decorating and entertaining ideas, favorite stores and, eventually, work by up-and-coming interior designers, she soon averaged two to three posts a day. The site quickly grew in popularity. Eventually, taking advantage of the rise of social media platforms, Smith worked to build up her following and expand sfgirlbybay.com’s reach. Today, in addition to 520,000 monthly visitors to her blog, sfgirlbybay.com has more than <a href="https://instagram.com/sfgirlbybay/">140,000 Instagram followers</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sfgirlbybay?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">43,000 Twitter followers</a>, 46,000 Facebook fans, and an impressive 583,000-plus Pinterest followers (including influencers such as Oprah and Martha Stewart).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Her photography itself did not go unnoticed. Laura Lee Mattingly, an editor at <a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/">Chronicle Books</a>, became a fan. “Victoria’s blog caught my attention years ago,” she says. “Her design sense is distinctive and has a great laid-back, sunny California feel. Her images drew me in—I actually purchased one of her prints right around the time I first reached out to her around 2010. It’s still hanging in my living room.” Beyond that, it was very clear that Smith’s Web presence was more than just numbers on a stat sheet to the publisher. Says Mattingly, “She interacts with her audience, keeps readers engaged, and her fans clearly adore her. This built-in platform, combined with her visual and editorial sense, made her very appealing as an author.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Chronicle Books published <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/See-San-Francisco-Through-SFGirlbyBay/dp/1452138206">See San Francisco: Through the Lens of SFGirlbyBay</a></em> in April 2015. A guide to San Francisco for visitors and locals, the book is an extension of Smith’s “Sunday in the City” column on sfgirlbybay.com. It is, in Mattingly’s words, “a love letter to the city.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Smith says, “I don’t think I would have been approached by a publisher without a blog or social media following.” Beyond having potential book buyers among her fans were the marketing and promotion opportunities her following provided. “It’s really been beneficial to have a social media following. People who have purchased the book have been taking Instagrams of it, styled in their homes and tagging me. So it’s been great to see my readers firsthand. And I was able to promote the book via social, too, although I tried not to oversell it. Not everyone wants to see that in my feed.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>She also organized events for her followers that generated book sales. “I was able to host a photowalk through San Francisco where we selected attendees via their Instagram photos tagged #SeeSanFrancisco. About 30 of us walked through the city one Saturday taking Instagrams. The was a fun way to promote the book and have a good time.”</div>

    <article_text><![CDATA[As the cost of producing and printing illustrated books has increased, trade publishers require higher sales figures and larger print runs in order to recoup their costs. “The numbers publishers now need are higher than ever,” says book packager <a href="http://www.robertmortonbooks.com/">Robert Morton</a>. A former editor at Abrams, Morton notes that a few years ago, a photo book that sold 7,000 copies was considered a success; now a publisher would be reluctant to take on a book unless it had the potential to sell many more copies. 
<p>To convince a publisher to take a chance on a book, photographers without notoriety or proven sales have to have an appealing subject, and evidence that the pool of potential buyers of their book “is beyond the photographer, their collectors, their grandmother and grandfather,” Morton says.</p>
<p>We asked Morton and other packagers of published photo books for advice on the key ingredients of a book proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Identify Your Audience</strong></p>
<p>“Sales and marketing departments are making more decisions than editors now about what is going to get published,” says book packager Wendy Burton, who worked in the sales and editorial departments of large book publishers, including Penguin and Abrams imprint Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang, before she launched her own business. </p>
<p>Sales and marketing people want to know the size of the audience who might be interested in the subject of your book, and where to find them. If your book appeals to fans of a certain subject, Morton suggests finding out if there’s a magazine or website that already reaches them. “What’s the circulation of the magazine? Are there clubs [devoted to] the subject? Do they have conventions or trips?”</p>
<p>Research on comparable books provides valuable information for a publisher. <a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/blog/author/alan-rapp/">Alan Rapp</a>, a consultant and editor at Monacelli says providing “comps” helps your proposal in two ways. “It shows that you know your field and your place in it,” he says. “It also shows you have a viable subject matter.”</p>
<p><strong>Make Your Book Appealing to Your Potential Audience</strong></p>
<p>Burton recommends creating a “layered” proposal. Consider how to add content to the book that provides context for the work and makes the book a richer, more valuable investment for people interested in your subject. For one book proposal she helped package, she found vintage, stereoscopic views of similar subjects to illuminate the history of the topic. </p>
<p>An introductory essay can also help explain and contextualize the photos, and having a recognized expert provide text adds authority. Morton notes, “You can have a statement from a photographic historian or curator,” to vouch for the value of the images, “and another person who writes about the subject. Both help.”</p>
<p><strong>Offer Marketing Ideas</strong></p>
<p>As more bookstores shutter, it’s important to find other venues where books can be sold, Morton notes. Photographers and authors are usually expected to help market the book through events or gallery openings. Through the process of researching and shooting the book, the photographer may already have developed contacts at organizations relevant to the book’s topic that may provide venues for book signings, slide shows, or public lectures where the audience has the chance to buy copies of the book. Finding contacts and possible venues before pitching the book can help strengthen a proposal.  </p>
<p>In writing proposals, Burton has at times provided information about the photographer’s expertise and experience giving interviews either on camera or off. This can help in pitching stories about the book or the photographer to press contacts. </p>
<p>The more potential sales and marketing ideas the photographer can offer, the easier the job is for the publisher. Says Burton, “When photographers are crafting their proposals, they have to think like a sales and marketing person.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[When we first meet Sister Lauren, she has just begun her new life as a nun. She is in her early twenties, but without makeup or other worldly trappings, she could easily pass for a college freshman. Her youthful fragility seems at odds with the solemn habit she wears and the stateliness of her surroundings: the columns of the monastery, the looming vault of the chapel. As we travel with her through <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1WRJrCS">Radical Love</a></em>, the new book by photographer <a href="http://tonigreaves.com/">Toni Greaves</a>, we see laughter and music; games, laundry and gardening; and meals taken in a cozy dining room, all the nuns seated together in a circle. Years pass—of snow angels, and chores and bible study in wood paneled libraries—as we follow Sister Lauren through her higher education of a different kind.
<p><em>Radical Love</em>, Greaves’s first book, is a stirring meditation on the journey of a young nun living in a cloistered community. The Australian-born, Portland, Oregon-based editorial and commercial photographer began the project early in her photography career, after 15 successful years working as a designer. That career change, and <em>Radical Love</em> itself, were both born from the tragic loss of Greaves’s mother in December, 2004. </p>
<p>As she writes in the book, “To be with her when she died, and to see the shift of her being there and then not there, marked the beginning of a deeply personal path of spiritual exploration and discovery that continues to this day.” On the two-year anniversary of her mother’s death, Greaves left her design job, determined to pursue her love of photography in earnest. Fittingly, almost ten years later, she’s publishing her photographic exploration of spirituality as a monograph.</p>
<p>Greaves first came to the Dominican Monastery of Our Lady of the Rosary in Summit, New Jersey, on February 22, 2008. She was living in New York City at the time and accompanying a writer on a freelance assignment—an article about several young women who had recently joined the monastery after finding it online. </p>
<p>“We went for a morning and I made some pictures while she did her interviews,” Greaves recalls, “then she left and I was having an amazing time, so I just decided to hang out and make more photos. I spent the day there and really had a lovely connection with the nuns.”</p>
<p>The experience stayed with her: The following week she approached the nuns and asked if she could return. </p>
<p>For the next sixth months, Greaves continued to visit the monastery, photographing the nuns in their daily lives without any particular focus. It was only after she was able to collect some strong images that Greaves realized that she wanted to center her project on one young nun in particular. She was captivated by Sister Lauren’s energy and was interested in exploring how this woman’s journey deep into her faith could exemplify something common to all the nuns. In this regard, the fact that Greaves had begun the project when Sister Lauren had only been at the monastery for three weeks was an added bonus. </p>
<p>Over the years Greaves returned to the monastery again and again, especially at important moments in Sister Lauren’s stages of formation (the process by which a would-be nun moves from Aspirant to Novitiate to full member of the monastery). Even after she moved across the country, Greaves would find a way to come calling, but not without actually calling first. “Although I have a very wonderful relationship with them, which I’m very grateful for, every single time I go there I need to get permission. It’s not assumed,” Greaves explains. “After all, they’re cloistered nuns, and their purpose in life doesn’t usually include having a photographer around.” Greaves takes a minimalist approach when it comes to gear, favoring one camera and a couple lenses. She wanders the monastery in her socks, camera in hand, using whatever natural light is available. </p>
<p>When describing time spent in the monastery, Greaves is effusive in discussing the joyful, vibrant, positive atmosphere that the women have created. “You know when you have a friend and they are in love with a new person, they have that little sparkle to them? That’s what I saw there,” she says. That love is what Greaves set out to capture in this work: the intensity of these women’s relationships with God. </p>
<p>It wasn’t until around 2012 that Greaves began to think about turning the project into a book. She went to a portfolio review at the 2012 Palm Springs Photo Festival with the intention of meeting representatives of two publishers. One was <a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/">Chronicle Books</a>, and as it turned out, she ended up having a meeting with the company’s owner and founder, Nion McEvoy. Although there was no commitment at the time, a couple of weeks after the review McEvoy let Greaves know that they were interested in publishing the book. </p>
<p>Even now, seven years after she first encountered the Dominican Nuns of Summit, New Jersey, Greaves intends to keep going back to the monastery for as long as they will have her. “People have this idea that by them closing themselves away, they are giving up all these things that make life rewarding, but I see it as the opposite,” Greaves explains. “They have figured out what they care about, what they love in life, and that is what they are going to do. So whereas out in the world many of us are floundering, looking for a sense of purpose, they have that already.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.gf.org/about/fellowship/">Guggenheim fellowships</a> are expressly for accomplished mid-career artists, not precocious new talent or particular projects.  Among the 11 photographers who won Guggenheim fellowships earlier this year were <a href="http://www.renaldi.com/">Richard Renaldi</a>, who is 47, and <a href="http://www.garybriechle.com/">Gary Briechle</a>, who is 59. Both say the key to their success was showing bodies of strong, mature work and being able to explain it in clear, concise terms.
<p>Renaldi, who won his Guggenheim Fellowship on his first try, hadn’t thought his work was mature enough to put him in the running after Aperture published his book <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1WRA8D2">Figure and Ground</a></em> in 2005. But last spring, he published <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1WRAfhJ">Touching Strangers</a></em><a href="http://amzn.to/1WRAfhJ">,</a> his acclaimed book of street photos of strangers he asked to interact with each other. “Now I have more of a sense of who I am, and what my work is about,” he says.</p>
<p>Briechle had applied unsuccessfully for a Guggenheim years ago. Four days before applications for the 2015 fellowships were due last fall, he says, he suddenly decided it was time to try again. He has been widely recognized in the art photography world for his alternative process photographs of his circle of friends, neighbors and relatives, all made near his home in Midcoast Maine. </p>
<p>“I was able to cobble it together in a few days,” he says of his application, which rivals Robert Frank’s legendary Guggenheim application for brevity, clarity and directness. </p>
<p>“Most of the photographs I’ve taken over the last 12 years since moving to Maine have been made within a few miles of my home,” Briechle’s application begins. “I am known in the community and have long-term photographic relationships with many people.” He goes on to explain that the fellowship would give him the opportunity to travel and photograph beyond the local community.</p>
<p>“More and more I’ve noticed that I’m seeing the socio-economic aspects [of my subject’s lives] present in the background of my work. I’d like to look beyond my community in Maine and use a wider lens to connect foreground and background.”</p>
<p>He listed who he’d like to photograph, where he’d have to travel to photograph them, and when he would do it. And that was the extent of it. </p>
<p>“Basically I said, ‘Business as usual, and maybe a little traveling to see my kids and family,’” Briechle says. “I kept it simple. Photography is a visual language, and I don’t think words equal it. If I wrote more than I did, I would be trying to talk to someone in art talk. It should be described simply.”</p>
<p>He took the same less-is-more approach to his portfolio, submitting 20 4 x 6-inch prints. “I figured, if they [jurors] were smart people, and of course they are, they would know I was using a good camera. I could have made big prints, but who am I impressing by making a big print?”</p>
<p>Briechle had help editing the selection of images from Jack Woody of <a href="https://twinpalms.com/books-artists/">Twin Palms Publishers</a>, which published <a href="https://twinpalms.com/books-artists/gary-briechle/">Briechle’s eponymous 2010 book</a>. He also included a copy of the book with his application, and when he put it all in the mail, he says, “I thought: I’m an idiot for what I just did. But I felt like I did the right thing for me. I wanted to say simple stuff about what I do.”</p>
<p>The most difficult part of the application, he says, was getting the four required recommendations. He approached Duane Michals, who had selected Briechle’s work for a portfolio feature in <em>Camera</em> magazine. “[Michals] said, ‘Yeah, I’ll do it, but I’ve written 20 recommendations over the years, and not one of them has gotten it [a Guggenheim fellowship],” Briechle says.</p>
<p>Briechle also solicited a recommendation from the owner of a Camden, <a href="http://www.zootcoffee.com/">Maine cafe called Zoot</a>, where Briechle shows his work once a year. The cafe owner, a graduate of Princeton University, “doesn’t have art credentials,” Briechle says, but he adds, “Some regular people might be artistic. I like that perspective, and she’s smart. She knew me as a person, and even though she doesn’t have credentials, she knows my work.”</p>
<p>For his part, Renaldi says he’d never applied for the Guggenheim previously because he was busy with commercial and editorial work, and didn’t really need the support. But the prestige and affirmation of the Guggenheim Fellowship appealed to him. “I felt like I really made a pretty important and valuable body of work and contribution [with <em>Touching Strangers</em>], and it was maybe my time” to apply, he says.</p>
<p>But Renaldi didn’t focus on <em>Touching Strangers</em> in the application, because that project has had so much press, he figured he didn’t need to talk about it. Instead, he focused his application on his latest project called <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/manhattan-sunday">“Manhattan Sunday,”</a> for which he photographs people making their way home from nightclubs early on Sunday mornings. </p>
<p>Renaldi approached his statement of his plans for the fellowship as an essay. “I kind of told my story, delved into my experience, and related it to the work,” he says. “I thought that would be a better route to go, than saying these are the kind of pictures I want to take, and this is how I want them to be exhibited.” </p>
<p>He explained that his “Manhattan Sunday” project is intertwined with his own history and experience as a gay person who came out as a young man, and found a community in the club scene “where there’s a sense of freedom, and being accepted for who you were.”</p>
<p>He went on to describe how he’s trying to capture, through photography, the feeling of staying out all night, then coming out of a club at the break of day “at a magical moment when the city is totally at rest. I was there, I saw the beauty [of it], so I was motivated to photograph it.”</p>
<p>Unlike Briechle, Renaldi labored over his essay for a couple of months. “You have to sit on things a while, to make sure you’re not missing things. And cutting is really important for sure. Being concise is really important, and [being] on point.” In all, his statement of purpose was three pages long, he says. (The career narrative, another required part of the Guggenheim application, was straightforward, and took much less time than his statement of plans, Renaldi says.)</p>
<p>He also submitted a more elaborate portfolio than Briechle did: a box of 20 archival pigment prints, each 16 x 20-inches on 17 x 22-inch paper—“so the images were really prominent”—with tissue paper between each print. </p>
<p>Renaldi’s advice to other photographers thinking of applying for a Guggenheim is to “know when you’re ready, when there’s a maturity to your work [and] a self-awareness” of what you’re doing as an artist. “I think that’s an important question to ask yourself: Am I ready for this?”</p>
<p>He also says it is important to be able to talk and write about your work in a clear, intelligent way—something he learned to do with his <em>Touching Strangers</em> work. “A lot of artists don’t want to [talk about their work], and think it should be able to stand on its own. But the fact is, you’re going be asked to do that.” </p>
<p>You’ll certainly be asked on most grant applications. For the Guggenheim and many other grants, what you say, and how you say it, can be as important as the quality of the work you submit.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<em><a href="http://amzn.to/1N3wtx7">Inside Chefs’ Fridges</a></em> features photos by American-born, Paris-based photographer <a href="http://www.carriesolomon.com/">Carrie Solomon</a> showing the contents of the home refrigerators of 40 of Europe’s most acclaimed chefs. The book also includes her portraits of each chef, and images of dishes they make at home. Her collaborator <a href="http://adrianmoore.blogspot.com/">Adrian Moore</a>, a concierge at the Mandarin Oriental in Paris who writes regularly about restaurants and culinary trends, wrote profiles on each chef. The book is a revealing look at the chefs’ personalities, lives and tastes, as reflected in staples they stock in their fridges, from exotic condiments they brought home from their travels to their kids’ favorite foods. “Some chefs made sure the fridge really reflected their image, and others didn’t care at all,” Solomon says. Peeking inside their fridges, she says, “explains how they spend their free time: If they entertain friends or hardly eat at home at all.”
<p>Due out this fall from TASCHEN,<em> <a href="http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/lifestyle/all/04619/facts.inside_chefs_fridges_europe_top_chefs_open_their_home_refrigerators.htm">Inside Chefs’ Fridges</a> </em>also includes addresses of each chef’s restaurant and recipes for each homemade dish, making it a guidebook for food tourists and a useful tool for home cooks. It’s one of the few cookbooks TASCHEN has published, but managing editor Florian Kobler says it has the “global appeal” the company looks for. TASCHEN is publishing the book in five languages. </p>
<p>“We were hoping we would attract people who want to try chefs’ recipes, and who follow celebrity chefs,” Solomon says. Solomon says that she and Moore have tried to “simplify and demystify” haute cuisine and make it accessible. Seeing that three-star Michelin chefs have plastic-wrapped vegetables or their kids’ favorite treats in their refrigerators is reassuring, Solomon notes: “Chefs are just like us.”</p>
<p>Solomon and Moore first met ten years ago on an assignment for a Paris guidebook. Over the years, Solomon published several books, and she and Moore had talked about collaborating on a project. They were looking for something that would feel “personal” and accessible, Solomon says. One evening, chatting at a culinary event that had attracted many of the top chefs in Paris, Moore suggested asking some of the chefs to let them see how they cook at home. Several agreed and, after some follow-up phone calls, Solomon had her first test subjects. </p>
<p>Though they came up with the concept quickly, Moore and Solomon continued to refine the idea, expanding the geographical scope from first Paris to France and then all of Europe. In 2013 they created a book proposal in PDF form to submit to publishers. It included photos Solomon had made in five chefs’ homes, sample profiles, and the list of celebrated chefs they hoped to cover. “We wanted to show that we had a unique project and the gumption to pull it off,” says Solomon.</p>
<p>They also provided their resumes, and Solomon wrote a detailed statement about the money they would need to travel to Copenhagen, Madrid, London, Modena, Italy and other cities. Kobler says the authors’ credentials and their detailed planning helped sell the proposal. “Of course, it has to have a great idea and popular potential, but at the end of the day there are many other factors. Can they actually pull it off? It’s one thing to do a one-sheet that displays an idea, but profiles of 40 chefs over the whole continent? It’s more tricky than you think.” Solomon emphasized to Kobler that she had managed other book projects from initial idea to completion, and also worked on cookbooks for which she gained the cooperation of multiple chefs. These included <em><a href="http://www.amazon.fr/Saveurs-sauvages-Carrie-Solomon/dp/2812602503">Sauveurs Sauvages</a></em>, the award-winning book on wild game for which Solomon made posed, formal portraits of 28 chefs. “I really learned a few things about how to approach chefs,” she says. “I knew to expect delays and cancellations, that I would have to call them over and over because they’re busy and much solicited.” Thanks to her track record, Kobler says, “We weren’t worried they couldn’t pull it off.” </p>
<p>TASCHEN still had other criteria to consider. “The sophistication and simplicity of the visual language is of course a key requirement for our books,” says Kobler. Solomon’s lighting gave a similar look to all her photos, no matter where she made them or at what time of day. “The fridge was meant to be the equalizer,” she says. “You wouldn’t know if you were in a luxurious kitchen or a short-term rental apartment.” Wanting to pack light for her travels while also compensating for disparate lighting conditions, she chose to shoot with on-camera flash, and used the same technique for her portraits. </p>
<p>Before each shoot, she texted the chef a production list, specifying details that would ensure consistency: Simple clothing for the portrait, plain tableware for the food shots, and dishes that could be made in about an hour during Moore and Solomon’s visit. “Sometimes I’d get there, and they hadn’t read it,” Solomon says, so the chef had to think of a new dish on the spot. “That was really interesting because it had to be something made with whatever they had on hand.”</p>
<p>In evaluating the book proposal, Kobler says, the biggest concern was whether Solomon and Moore had selected the right chefs. TASCHEN produces many “best of” compilations. “It’s all about the curation,” Kobler says. “Because we’re not cookbook experts,” Kobler notes, company founder Benedikt Taschen asked friends who are chefs in Los Angeles to review the list. “They basically gave it their thumbs up,” Solomon says. </p>
<p>When the TASCHEN sales team reviewed the proposal, they discussed comparable books and their prices. “We know that cookbooks are more in the affordable range than high-end books,” Kobler notes. “This is a book that people will want to use as a cookbook, so we can’t go double the price range for cookbooks.” </p>
<p>While TASCHEN deliberated, Solomon and Moore were also negotiating a deal with a French publisher. Then, a year and a half ago, TASCHEN offered them a deal, including an advance to cover their travel. <a href="http://amzn.to/1N3wtx7">The book, 328 pages long, will sell for $50</a>: more than some cookbooks but, says Kobler, “well-designed and carefully put together.”</p>
<p>More modifications followed. TASCHEN’s sales representative for Latin America said including a chef from Portugal would help sales, so Solomon and Moore went to Lisbon to profile <a href="http://www.joseavillez.pt/en/">Jose Avillez,</a> whose restaurant Belcanto earned two Michelin stars. </p>
<p>Nathan Myhrvold, author of <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1LlSmIQ">Modernist Cuisine: The Art and Science of Cooking</a></em>, also published by TASCHEN, agreed to write a foreword. “We wanted him to geek out,” says Solomon. His essay on the history of refrigeration inspired Solomon to add a photo of the back of a fridge, showing its mechanics. </p>
<p>As publication nears, Solomon and Moore are helping market the book through their connections in the food world. Solomon explains, “We both know a lot of these chefs, so we’re asking their help in putting together events and we’re hoping that a lot of them will sell the books in their restaurants.”</p>
<p>Bringing the book to market has been a long process. When Solomon shot the first photos for the project, she was pregnant with her first child. “She’s now four,” the photographer says. She’s shot several cookbooks on commission from publishers, but says working on a book like Inside Chefs’ Fridges is more satisfying. “I really enjoy the books that come from an idea that I’ve had.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[A hundred photographs of the same secluded beach in Portugal, made from roughly the same perspective over the course of eight years: It may not sound like a photo book that would interest a major illustrated book publisher like Chronicle Books, or that would find success with a general audience, but that is exactly what French photographer <a href="http://www.christianchaize.com/">Christian Chaize’s</a> book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Time-Tide-Photographs-Praia-Piquinia/dp/1452114080">Time &amp; Tide: Photographs from Praia Piquinia</a></em>, accomplished.
<p><a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/blog/2014/11/10/yes-i-am-the-art-book-editor-and-yes-i-want-to-hear-from-you/">Bridget Watson Payne</a>, Chronicle Books’ senior editor for art publishing, was drawn to Chaize’s images when she received his proposal, but photography that is merely “technically very accomplished” won’t lead to success with a general audience, she notes. “The single biggest determiner of success in the trade is whether or not a photobook has a strong secondary audience, beyond a fine-art photography audience,” Watson Payne explains. In Chaize’s case, his book can also appeal to a person who loves beaches or travel, “someone longing nostalgically for the sea or summer,” she told <em>PDN</em> via email. Chaize’s photographs “worked in both of those ways, and I saw a lot of potential in that, both esthetically and commercially,” Watson Payne notes.</p>
<p>“I never imagined that one day so many people would be interested in my study of a single beach,” he told <em>PDN </em>via through his agent and translator, Jenni Holder. “Aside from the individual appeal of any single image, the series is easily subject to—and informed by—the act of contrast and comparison from one image, or day, or year, to the next.”</p>
<p>From image to image in Chaize’s book, the tide comes in and out, the sky shifts from hazy to crystal clear, and the colors of the beach umbrellas change, as do the beachgoers and their activities and interactions. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Time-Tide-Photographs-Praia-Piquinia/dp/1452114080">The $35 book</a>, which was released in Spring 2013, is 156 pages, includes 100 images, and was printed at a generous 11 x 13-inch trim size. </p>
<p>Chaize’s book has something other books of beach scenery don’t: A reason to linger over the pages. He chose to include details of certain images in the book, an idea he specified in his proposal. “Full bleeds of details, and alternate cropping, would offer [readers] an opportunity to experience and examine the work in a way that might only be duplicated by living with a large collection of my actual photographs over a long period time,” he wrote.</p>
<p>To illustrate the idea, he worked with a designer he knew to mock up pages that showed book spreads featuring both the full-size photographs and close-ups of details. (He also envisioned using gatefolds, but had to abandon that idea due to budget concerns.) The images, Watson Payne notes, are still the most important element of a photography book proposal. “Sometimes prospective authors get caught up in publisher’s submission guidelines and find themselves crafting a wonderfully detailed, meticulous and long, text-based book proposal.” She recommends leading with at least one photograph, and then illustrating the rest of the proposal with more images.</p>
<p>Chaize’s proposal included a biography and artist’s statement, in addition to his description of how he envisioned the design and overall experience of the book. Other elements in a proposal might include competitive title research, descriptions of the potential audience and marketing ideas. Watson Payne believes “the more of this kind of work the photographer is willing to do, the better.” She says it’s “not the end of the world” if the photographer doesn’t address these topics in their proposal, but it does make it easier for the editor to evaluate the project’s potential. Watson Payne suggests photographers ask themselves this: “Do you really want to saddle the person who is about to consider your book proposal with a bunch of work?” Plus, she points out, “photographers have been living and breathing their subject matter for ages—no one is likely to know what the other books out there on their subjects are, [or] know who the audience for their work is, nearly as well as they do. They are the experts and I want to learn from their expertise.”</p>
<p>Another factor that helped Chaize land a book deal is that he has gallery representation. <a href="http://jenbekman.com/">Jen Bekman</a>, who represents his work at her gallery and on <a href="http://20x200.com/">her affordable art site 20x200</a>, has what she calls a “constant dialogue” with Chronicle, and introduced Chaize’s work to Watson Payne. Chaize’s success selling his work with Bekman and 20x200—Bekman says she’s sold “thousands of Christian’s prints”—demonstrated the work’s ability to reach a more general audience. “I know a lot about who responds to Christian’s work because I’ve been working with him for such a long time,” Bekman says. “It was meaningful to [Chronicle] that Christian already had an audience,” she adds. “Because most photographers don’t have literary agents, I do often see gallerists acting as something like book agents for some of their artists,” Watson Payne notes. </p>
<p>She adds, however, that working with a gallery or an agent isn’t essential to her. “Other factors—like having a strong social media platform—can end up having a much bigger impact on book sales,” she says. And while some publishers won’t accept proposals unless they come through an agent, that isn’t the case at Chronicle. But, as Watson Payne notes, “If someone is trying to break into a very crowded and competitive field (children’s books, for instance, or food photography); or just wants to focus on creative work and not spend time dealing with business matters like negotiations and contracts; or is really struggling developing their book pitch, then an agent can be a great help.”</p>
<p>In retrospect, Chaize says, he wonders if he could have done more “to promote the book in this social-media-rich environment,” or if he should have tried to schedule more book signings “to have the chance to meet more of the people who appreciate my work.” But he is also delighted by the experience of working with Watson Payne and finding a trade audience for his book.</p>
<p>Other photographers with projects that can reach beyond the specialized photo-book audience should be encouraged by his experience, and by the market for art books in general, Watson Payne notes. “Books by individual photographers can do very well in the trade—in fact art books as a whole are one of the most robust categories in trade publishing right now, because they are almost entirely immune to sales erosion from ebook sales—if their subject matter appeals to a broad secondary audience.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[The most effective way to protect your images against rampant theft is to register your copyrights. “If you don’t register your copyrights, you’re perpetually a victim” because you have no leverage to make infringers pay, says photographer <a href="http://www.michaelgrecco.com/">Michael Grecco</a>.
<p>Registration before an infringement occurs gives you leverage, he explains, because it makes you eligible for statutory damages (ranging up to $150,000) for each image, plus attorney’s fees. Those numbers scare infringers, so showing proof of your copyright registration will typically make them willing to negotiate with you.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when unregistered images are stolen, infringers may be less intimidated, because you are eligible only for actual damages, which are difficult to prove in court. The most they’ll pay in most cases is a normal licensing fee, but you’ll spend many times that amount suing them.</p>
<p>Despite the legal protection provided by timely registration of every image, many photographers don’t bother because they figure registration is more trouble than it is worth. Grecco insists otherwise. “It’s been part of my regular workflow since 1998. I routinely register every image, all the time,” he says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the effort more than pays for itself, he adds. “My collections for infringement far surpass revenues I was getting ten years ago for my syndication and creative stock, when that market was a viable market,” he says. (He uses a service, <a href="https://www.imagerights.com/">imagerights.com,</a> to troll the Internet for unauthorized uses of his images.) Grecco’s goal is to register all of his images before they are published, and he’s built a system into his workflow to accomplish that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s easier and less expensive to register unpublished images,” he says. That’s because unpublished images can be registered in bulk: For one fee ($65), and with one form (called <a href="http://copyright.gov/forms/formva.pdf">Form VA</a>), you can register online an unlimited number of unpublished images. (Once an image is published, it has to be registered individually for $35, or with other published images for a $65 fee. Published and unpublished images cannot be registered together on the same form.)</p>
<p>Grecco’s system for registering images is the same system he uses to archive his work. First, he collects in a single folder all of his unpublished images as he shoots them. The folder is identified by a date range, beginning with the day after his last bulk registration, and ending with the date he submits the entire folder to the US Copyright Office with a form to register all of the images in the folder. For instance, unpublished images shot between July 30, 2012 and November 26, 2012, resided in a fold titled 20120730_to_20121126_Grecco_Unpublished.</p>
<p>Within each folder of unpublished images are sub-folders for every job Grecco shoots, with a date, subject name, and Grecco’s initials. For instance, a folder titled 20120820_Bucknell_MPG contains images he shot August 20, 2012 for a capital campaign for Bucknell University.</p>
<p>Inside each of the job folders are image files that carry the job folder name, plus a unique three-digit image number. For instance, images in the Bucknell job folder are titled 20120820_Bucknell_MPG_005.jpg, 20120820_Bucknell_MPG_006.jpg, etc.</p>
<p>Grecco’s digital tech names the image files according to that protocol as the files are copied on set from camera to hard drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grecco stresses, “You want to name an image file one time, and register the image with that same file name.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>He keeps track of pending publication dates for the images in the Unpublished Images folder. When any image in the folder is about to be published, he registers every image in the folder in bulk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grecco filed his first copyright registration form with the help of an attorney, to make sure he was filling out the form correctly. Then he set up a template for future registration submissions. “The template enables me to easily [register images]. All I have to do is change the date range” on the registration form, he explains.</p>
<p>Because Grecco begins his image file names with the date they are shot, he ends up registering all of his images chronologically. That way, the registration form associated with each image is easy to find, if and when an image is infringed and he needs to produce a copy of the registration form to get the attention of the infringer.</p>
<p>Grecco emphasizes the importance of leaving image file names unchanged as they go to and from the retoucher, or to and from clients. (The files may be different formats--JPEGs when shown to clients, DNG files when archived.) If the names of images are changed, and versions of the same image end up with different names, you might never be able to match an infringed image with the copyright registration records.</p>
<p>The US Copyright Office requires digital copies of every image listed on a registration form. Grecco says he limits the size of the image files he submits to 450 pixels by 450 pixels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I want them large enough to be recognized, but not large enough for someone to go to the Copyright Office and steal them,” &nbsp;he says.</p>
<p>With a registration system built into his workflow, Grecco insists that it is much easier to register copyrights than most photographers assume it is. And more photographers need to make registration part of their workflow for their own good— and everyone else’s, he says. “People are systematically stealing, and we need to systematically defend ourselves.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[In 2006, <a href="http://www.susanmiddleton.com/Susan_Middleton/Home.html">Susan Middleton</a> began her work photographing marine invertebrates while aboard a research vessel that was exploring the French Frigate Shoals, 500 miles west of Honolulu, Hawaii. Even then, bobbing in the Pacific with scientists from around the world, she knew she was working on a book. With several previous titles to her credit, Middleton tends to be “book-oriented,” she says. 
<p>Middleton also knew she wanted the book, which she’d eventually publish with Abrams in October 2014, to reach as many people as possible. “I really wanted to reach out to a general audience,” she remembers. “I wanted kids to be engaged by the images. I wanted to reach out to people who are passionate about photography; [to] artists, designers, fashion designers. I wanted to reach out to people who were in the sciences and were passionate about biology, and also [to] the conservation community.”</p>
<p>All of that is easier said than done. A number of factors helped Middleton place her book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Spineless-Susan-Middleton/dp/1419710079">Spineless: Portraits of Marine Invertebrates, the Backbone of Life</a></em>, with Abrams and create a package that could appeal to a wide range of viewers. Her esthetic approach of isolating the odd, beautiful and lesser-known animals on seamless backgrounds appealed to Eric Himmel, her editor at Abrams. “You see that [Susan is] photographing animals that are unusual, and she’s doing it in a way that’s very difficult.”</p>
<p>Middleton consciously “rides the line between art and science,” in her work, she explains, attracting people through esthetics and then engaging them in the content of her images. “I’m fundamentally an artist, but I attach myself to scientists to guide what I do. I think Eric has always appreciated that sweet spot between art and science.”</p>
<p>Himmel says the science and nature category is “a little bit underserved” by publishers. “I don’t think [they] take it as seriously as they should.” With a greater portion of the public interested in conservation and the environment, Himmel recognizes the market for books that look in a unique way at the natural world. “Work in [science and nature] is really being done on a very high level now because of interest, because of technology; I think an urgent sense that the world is going to hell plays a role,” he explains. Artists like Middleton and <a href="http://timflach.com/">Tim Flach</a>, another Abrams author, are “operating on a pretty high level of thought,” he says, and their work “[is] an attempt to do something new, an attempt to incorporate some esthetic values that are not simply from the realm of traditional nature photography.”</p>
<p>Middleton submitted her proposal in 2012, after six years working sporadically on the series and thinking about how to shape it. She’d co-authored a previous book with Abrams and that contract gave them first refusal rights for her next book, but she says she prepared her proposal the same way she would have for any publisher. The most important piece was a set of 50 5 x 7-inch prints “that I felt were really strong and that represented the diversity that I intended for the book to contain,” she says. “My feeling was I wanted it to be a nice little package where the prints were big enough to be able to convey the work, but small enough that they could go in somebody’s briefcase or be shuffled like a big deck of cards on a conference table.”</p>
<p>She also included a CV and “several pages of how I envisioned the book.” Having spent years “eavesdropping on really intensive marine invertebrate classes” on research vessels and at the University of Washington’s marine laboratory on San Juan Island, Middleton wanted to write the text herself and had ideas about how the book could be chaptered. She also envisioned a page count and trim size. “That’s not saying that’s what’s going to end up happening,” she counsels, “and in fact in my case the page count and trim size increased once we actually got down to the final production decisions, but I did have an idea of how I thought the book could be and I expressed that.”</p>
<p>Himmel says he’s seen proposals of all shapes and sizes in his 35 years as an editor, and he “doesn’t have a prescriptive format.” But, he adds, “a good proposal should be clear and lucid about the purpose of the book and its main focus, and convey the writer’s understanding or belief of why people would be interested.” Photographers should include “a reasonable amount of visual material.” He doesn’t want to see finished layouts unless they’re done professionally. “We work with good book designers and we have a lot of experience making books, so when faced with images and text, we can imagine what a book could look like,” he says.</p>
<p>The author’s name recognition, exhibition and/or publication histories, and marketing hooks are all important. “We need to get some sense not just of what the material is, but who the person presenting it is,” he says.</p>
<p>Middleton’s affiliations with science museums and conservation groups “that you could look to to help promote the book when it was published” factored into Himmel’s evaluation of her proposal. He also had in the back of his mind another book about deep-sea creatures that he’d passed on, which sold tens of thousands of copies for another publisher. “In an editor’s life, when you pass on something that then goes on to show that you made a big mistake, your antennae are up,” he explains.</p>
<p>Himmel says he doesn’t expect authors to submit comparative title research with their proposals, but “comps” are key to demonstrating “to colleagues who are not in the editorial department why you think a book will sell.” (This is part of the reason it’s difficult to publish photographic monographs, he adds: “It’s very hard to point to comps.”) “The old joke is that the perfect book is the book that’s completely original that’s really like something else that was very successful,” he laughs. Spineless can be seen as that perfect combination of unique photographs in a category that has been successful.</p>
<p>When <em>PDN</em> spoke with Middleton in late July, she was on San Juan Island for an artist’s residency. A new museum was showing her marine invertebrates work, much of which was made at the research lab nearby. Though the world of marine invertebrates is little-known, they are essential to ocean and terrestrial ecosystems, and they are also very sensitive to climate change and ocean acidification, she says, so her work “ends up having a resonance that goes beyond just pictures of a little-known realm of life.” As a longtime conservation photographer, reaching a general audience means exposing people to an essential category of animals.</p>
<p>“In the end, I think what really grabs people is just how bizarre they are, how interesting they are, how beautiful a lot of them are, and how unexpected they are,” she says. “One woman [at] the exhibit the other day—she didn’t know I was the artist; I was being incognito—she looked at me and she said, ‘These pictures make humans seem really boring.’ And I said, ‘I know, that’s the way I feel.’”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Despite a series of legal victories for photographers over the right to photograph police doing their jobs, harassment and arrests have continued all over the country. Which raises the question: When will police stop viewing photographers with suspicion and hostility?
<p>“I still hear about photographers being interfered with and/or arrested on almost a daily basis,” says <a href="http://buffalo-law.com/">Mickey Osterreicher</a>, attorney for the <a href="https://nppa.org/">National Press Photographers Association (NPPA)</a>. </p>
<p>And yet, there are signs that at least some police departments are getting the message. Osterreicher has traveled to Ft. Lauderdale, Dallas, Indianapolis, San Diego, Los Angeles and other cities to lead workshops about photographers’ rights with various police departments. “Initially they’re skeptical, but by the end of the session, they get it. But taking the message to 150 officers at a time might take me three or four lifetimes” to change police/photographer dynamics nationally, he says.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aclusocal.org/about/bios/peter-bibring/">American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) attorney Peter Bibring</a> is cautiously optimistic about signs of change, at least in some places. “Anecdotally, it is a mixed bag. We know it [arrests and harassment] still happens,” he says. He recently helped San Diego photographers Shawn Nee, Greggory Moore and Shane Quentin win a $50,000 settlement against the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department for unlawful detention while they were photographing in public places. Bibring adds that some ACLU offices around the country still report getting complaints “all the time. But others say, ‘No, things are better.’”</p>
<p>Los Angeles photographer <a href="http://halbergman.com/">Hal Bergman</a>, a Getty contributor who specializes in images of industrial sites and infrastructure—a specialty that arouses the suspicions of law enforcement practically every time he goes out to shoot—says, “Things have improved dramatically” since he started shooting around 2007. The default response of police back then was to handcuff him and throw him in the back of a cruiser. But it has been a few years since that has happened, he says. “The tone now seems to be: Let’s have a nice conversation, and see what [the photographer] is doing.”</p>
<p>Bergman surmises that police respond more rationally to him at least in part because he’s changed his own behavior. He doesn’t answer suspicious officers by immediately asserting his rights. He notifies police in advance when he’s going to be photographing in areas like the port of Los Angeles. And he carries his portfolio on an iPad so he can show any suspicious police officers what he does. </p>
<p>But Bergman says there’s also a lot more awareness on the part of police “that you’re allowed to be there. I think they realize [that to] investigate anyone with a camera is not an appropriate response.”</p>
<p>Court rulings over the past few years in favor of photographers have almost certainly had an effect. The message the courts are sending is that it may cost taxpayers a lot of money if police violate citizens’ civil rights by interfering with photographers. </p>
<p>For instance, the City of Baltimore agreed in April 2014 to pay $250,000 to settle a claim of unlawful seizure and destruction of cellphone videos belonging to Christopher Sharp, who allegedly recorded police arresting and beating another person. The Baltimore Police Department also agreed to adopt a comprehensive written policy intended to protect the rights of citizens to photograph and record police activity from anywhere those citizens have a legal right to be.</p>
<p>Suffolk County, New York agreed in June 2014 to pay $200,000 to settle civil rights claims stemming from freelance news videographer Philip Datz’s unlawful arrest for recording police activity in 2011. Suffolk County Police Department also instituted a training program for its officers to safeguard “the constitutional right of the public and press to observe, photograph and record police activity in locations open to the public,” according to the settlement terms.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the town of Weare, New Hampshire and the City of New Haven, Connecticut, agreed last year to pay $57,000 and $18,500, respectively, to settle civil rights claims of unlawful arrests of citizens taking photographs of police.</p>
<p>In Austin, Texas, a federal court judge rejected an argument last July that the right to photograph or videotape police officers “is not recognized as a constitutional right,” clearing the way for a citizen’s civil rights claim against the City of Austin, its police chief, and various Austin police officers. The plaintiff, Antonio Buehler, was first arrested in January 2012 for photographing a traffic stop. </p>
<p>The NPPA’s Osterreicher has described the arrests of photographers in one jurisdiction after another as “a game of whack-a-mole.” But the court rulings in photographers’ favor are having an impact, he explained, because they are slowly but surely eroding the “qualified immunity” defense of police officers around the country.</p>
<p>The doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages unless they violate laws or statutes that are clearly established. Osterreicher says the right to record police activity is now clearly established by court rulings in the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth and Eleventh circuits. (The aforementioned Texas case was a rejection of the qualified immunity defense. Texas is in the Fifth Circuit.)</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice has also helped photographers’ cause by weighing in for citizens’ rights to record police activity, most recently in a scathing report about the operations of the Ferguson, Missouri police department. The DOJ report said Ferguson police  officers “frequently infringe on residents’ First Amendment rights, interfering with their right to record police activities and making enforcement decisions based on the content of individuals’ expression.”</p>
<p>The DOJ report cited several examples, and went on to recommend a series of police department reforms. One of the DOJ recommendations called for the Ferguson police department to “develop and implement policy and training regarding appropriate police response to activities protected by the First Amendment, including the right to observe, record, and protest police action.”</p>
<p>Previously, the DOJ had urged various courts and police departments to safeguard the free speech and due process rights of photographers, as well as their rights to protection against unlawful search and seizure. For instance, the DOJ intervened in the case of Sharp v. Baltimore Police Department by issuing a blueprint for police department reforms.</p>
<p>The Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department adopted that DOJ blueprint in 2012, to settle a right-to-photograph lawsuit filed by an aspiring photojournalist and the ACLU. In adopting the DOJ recommendations, the D.C. police department issued a general order stating that “a bystander has the right under the First Amendment to observe and record [District police officers] in the public discharge of their duties.”</p>
<p>Despite all those signs of progress, photographers’ advocates expect the conflict between police and photographers to continue. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.wileyrein.com/professionals-MaryBorja.html">Attorney Mary Borja</a>, who represented Sharp in his claim against Baltimore police, says: “In a post-9/11 world, there’s a lot of, ‘Well, it’s the Patriot Act,’ which is the crutch [police] use to justify improper activities that interfere with journalists doing their jobs.”</p>
<p>The ACLU’s Bibring also says police interference with photographers “flowed clearly from counter-terrorism training.” The message of the training has been that photography should be treated as suspicious activity, because photographers could be terrorists surveying targets. </p>
<p>“We’re still seeing [photographers] getting stopped,” so the problem isn’t solved, he adds. “I don’t know what the problem is. I think it is that police really don’t like to be photographed.”</p>
<p>Bibring notes that even if police do get the message that citizens have a First Amendment right to photograph police activity, that right isn’t absolute. It is subject to time, manner and place restrictions that are open to interpretation by police officers. </p>
<p>Specifically, police officers can order bystanders out of the way so they aren’t interfering with police activity. “There’s going to be a tension between officers asserting obstruction” and photographers asserting their rights to photograph, Bibring says. “If an officer tells a photographer, ‘Turn it off,’ that’s a clear violation of the law. But if an officer says a photographer was arrested for being too close [i.e., interfering with police activity], it becomes a he-said, she-said situation.”</p>
<p>Which means, of course, that tensions between police and photographers may diminish, but never completely disappear, forcing photographers to periodically defend their civil rights in court. </p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Photographers and video makers have shared their techniques for lighting moving subjects. Their advice covers not only how to choose lighting that can freeze a splash or capture action on location, but also advice for getting believable, consistent and cinematic lighting when working on a video production. Full interviews with these photographers, and other step-by-step details on lighting still and video productions, can be found at <a href="http://pdnonline.com/features/lighting.shtml">PDNOnline.com/features/lighting.shtml</a>.
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/How-I-Got-That-Shot-9744.shtml">How I Got That Shot: Capturing Perfect Scoops of Ice Cream</a></strong></p>
<p>Beauty and still-life photographer <a href="http://www.andersonhopkins.com/artists/69/lisa-shin/images/262/NEW-WORK">Lisa Shin</a> frequently lights luxury items and cosmetics in a way that creates “sexy, dramatic shadows and glowing highlights.” For a campaign for Haagen-Dazs, creatives at Team One hired Shin to apply the same technique to shooting ice cream. The job required her to capture a pour of chocolate syrup and bring out its sheen, shooting at 1/7500 of a second. “It’s very much like photographing a shiny, metallic mascara bottle,” says Shin, who explains all the steps she took to freeze each flavor of ice cream at the proper temperature, and make sure her products didn’t melt on set. </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://pdnonline.com/features/5-Lighting-Design-Ti-10830.shtml">5 Lighting Design Tips for Video Productions</a> </strong></p>
<p>Photographer and filmmaker <a href="http://www.eduardoangel.com/">Eduardo Angel</a> shares his tips for lighting videos, including his favorite methods to maintain consistency when shooting over extended periods of time. That typically requires him to minimize the effect of the ambient, natural light on the scene; he explains how he and his crew do that.  </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/Frames-Per-Second-H-10336.shtml">How Storyboarding Can Make Your Video More Cinematic</a></strong></p>
<p>Cinematographer <a href="http://www.ryanewalters.com/">Ryan E. Walters</a> says that one of the most important steps in the pre-production process leading up to a video shoot is creating a storyboard based on a careful location scout. He explains how he evaluates the light available in the location and how it might shift, and the apps he uses to map the sun at any location. This information goes into a detailed, frame-by-frame map of all the shots he needs to fully tell a story with video.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/How-I-Got-That-Shot-11024.shtml">Photographing a Shiny New Ferrari</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.timdamon.net/">Tim Damon</a> has been an automotive photographer for 25 years, but he says being given the keys to a new Ferrari for two days with instructions from the client to take “cool pictures” was “a dream job.” In addition to making shots outdoors and in his own shooting bay, he also photographed the car in a dark parking garage that he transformed into a studio. Using multiple lights and a camera rig of his own design, he shot a long exposure that showed the contours of the car in detail, but showed the dark walls around it as a blur. That required adjusting the lighting to accommodate the car’s movement. “When you’re doing a rig shot you don’t put a light here and there,” he explains. “The only way you’re going to get it is to start doing your exposure, and then moving your lights. It sounds tedious but it’s fun.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bill-cahill.com/">Bill Cahill</a> has extensive experience shooting liquids and splashes. Creature in Seattle hired him to shoot an ad for the Champagne Bureau, the trade association, that required him to sculpt the effervescent liquid into the shape of a question mark. He worked with a prop maker who crafted tubing, and tested different splashes as well as lights and cards. He was most concerned with lighting the outline of the model and bringing out highlights in the droplets on the edges. He notes, “Champagne is a fairly pale color liquid. It generally just looks like bubbly water against black if you don’t light it properly.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Due out this month is photographer <a href="http://www.mehringphoto.com/">Jonathan Mehring’s</a> first book, called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Skate-World-Photographing-One-Skateboarding/dp/1426213964">Skate the World</a></em>, featuring images he’s made over a period of 15 years of skateboarding in unexpected places all over the globe. The book, published by National Geographic Books with sponsorship from Levi’s, is a case study in the challenges of shaping, pitching and funding a book, as well as the importance of personal relationships—and luck.
<p>Mehring and Susan Hitchcock, the senior editor at National Geographic Books who championed Mehring’s work, hit one obstacle after another over the five years they tried to get the book published. “I can’t believe it’s actually coming out,” Mehring says. “It’s all about relationships. It’s who you know. And a lot of it has to do with timing.”</p>
<p>Publication finally turned on a chance meeting Mehring had last year with Erik Wolsky, Levi’s senior global marketing manager, in La Paz, Bolivia. Trying to earn goodwill within the skater community, Levi’s was building skateparks for underprivileged skaters in places around the world. The company had hired Mehring to document a construction project in La Paz.</p>
<p>“Erik was there, and we were hanging out a lot,” says Mehring. “I was like, ‘This is a perfect fit. You’re trying to promote the sport. My book takes a global view, and Levi’s is taking a global view. And he was like, ‘Yeah, cool. I think it will work.’”</p>
<p>“That meeting between Jonathan and Erik flipped the switch in National Geographic’s book division,” Hitchcock says, “because once we know we have even a small contribution for a book, we can move forward.” </p>
<p>But what a long, circuitous road it was. The idea for the book came to life in 2009, when Mehring and Hitchcock ran into each other at a party. A long-time friend of Mehring’s parents, Hitchcock says, “I’ve been watching his career develop, and he started telling me about the trips he’d been taking.”</p>
<p>At the time, Mehring was a staff photographer for <em>Skateboarder</em> magazine. He was traveling the world with pro skaters, looking for ever more out-of-the-way skating venues as backdrops for his shoots. One trip was along the Trans-Siberian Railway. Another was to Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, which has been rebuilt since the fall of the Soviet Union with some of the world’s most outlandish architecture.</p>
<p>“These former communist capitals are built with a lot of granite and marble, so they’re conducive to skating,” Mehring says.</p>
<p>Hitchcock says that as Mehring was describing those adventures, she thought: This is a book. “There was a theme, which was skateboarding around the world, and as we got to talking, there was a message there, which was that skateboarding ends up being a universal language,” she explains. And Mehring, she adds, was going beyond skateboard action photography. “He was getting interested in the local kids he would meet in Brazil and Thailand, and how they were figuring out how to skateboard without parks and equipment that American kids have.”</p>
<p>She pitched the book idea back at the office. Editors invited Mehring in to present his work. He showed up with a Kodak photo paper box full of about 50 prints. “I didn’t see it as a pitch. I was clueless,” says Mehring, who was 28 or 29 at the time. “They said, ‘We’ll get back to you.’”</p>
<p>Hitchcock says the book needed some shaping, as well as more photographs to represent the six most populous continents. Mehring continued traveling the world for Skateboarder magazine, filling the holes. (In the end, 30 percent of the photographs were sourced from other photographers, mostly to cover skateboarding across the continent of Africa.)</p>
<p>But Hitchcock was having trouble getting a green light for the book. “Skateboarders don’t buy books: That was one big message I got,” she says. She also says, “I don’t think they thought of skateboarding as a  National Geographic sport. We do mountain climbing and deep sea diving.”</p>
<p>But as editors came and went, she kept pitching the idea. “I definitely championed it because I knew Jonathan. I also thought it was a cool thing he’s been doing for the past ten years. I love pictures of kids from all over the world with skateboards built with pieces of lumber and roller-skate wheels,” she says.</p>
<p>Around 2011, the idea started to get some traction inside National Geographic. But the publisher didn’t want to assume all the risk, so Hitchcock told Mehring he might improve chances of publication if he found a sponsor to help defray costs.</p>
<p>Hitchcock says National Geographic occasionally asks author/photographers to find sponsors for their books, and typically seeks sponsorship contributions totaling $100,000 in those cases. That amounts to “a good half of the budget” for photography books, she estimates, explaining that the costs reflect the larger dimensions and higher paper quality of photo books, compared to non-photographic books.</p>
<p>Mehring wasn’t given a sponsorship dollar amount, or any promises the book would be published if he did find a sponsor. But he had nothing to lose by trying. “I reached out to a couple of brands I thought might have an interest”—shoe brands in particular, he says—“and I got no response.”</p>
<p>Then, in 2013, he had a chance encounter with Levi’s on a trip to India with some pro skaters. “I heard that Bangalore was an up-and-coming tech center. I figured there would be new architecture, and thought it might be conducive to skating,” he says. “While I was there, [<em>Skateboarder’s</em>] ad guy said, ‘Levis just hit us up about advertising. They’re in Bangalore right now working on a skatepark project.’”</p>
<p>Mehring contacted the production company Levi’s had hired to document the project, and got hired to shoot some photographs of it for advertising, PR and social media. While he was there, he met people from the Levi’s marketing team.</p>
<p>“They ended up hiring me for their next project. I was enthusiastic about what they were doing, and I was into documenting the local scene and local people,” he says. That second project was in La Paz, where he met Erik Wolsky, and made his successful pitch for help with his book.</p>
<p>Mehring says that as part of his pitch, he offered to include positive stories in the book about a couple of the Levi’s skatepark construction projects. “Each chapter has a local story about how skating is benefitting the community,” he explains. The Levi’s projects fit the narrative.</p>
<p>“For me, [the book sponsorship] just made a lot of sense because a big chunk of the book would have to do with projects” for skaters at the local level, Wolsky says. The benefit for Levi’s of sponsoring Mehring’s book, he explains, “is really to take stories we’ve told already and give them a chance to be told again through a different medium, to a wider audience.” </p>
<p>Levi’s didn’t ask for any editorial control over Mehring’s book, nor does National Geographic cede that to book sponsors, Hitchcock says. What Levi’s did get, however, was the reproduction of its logo on the cover of the book, a sponsor page inside, and a promise that National Geographic would mention the sponsorship in all of its promotions for the book. </p>
<p> “It really was an easy conversation [over terms],” says Wolsky. “Our brand would be there, with stories about it.”</p>
<p>In exchange, Levi’s committed an undisclosed sum to help defray production costs for an initial print run of 15,000 copies. Levi’s also agreed to buy several thousand of those copies for distribution in lots of 24 to more than 250 retail stores around the world that sell Levi’s skate jeans.</p>
<p>But there was a misunderstanding about who would pay the cost—amounting to tens of thousands of dollars—of mailing all those books to the stores, Hitchcock says. “Because shipping costs were prohibitive, that part of the deal was nixed.”</p>
<p>The print run was cut to 8,000 copies, and in the end, the Levi’s contribution amounted to about 10 percent of the overall production costs—”a relatively small amount of money” for sponsorship of a book, Hitchcock says.</p>
<p>She adds that National Geographic probably would not have published the book, had it known that Levi’s didn’t expect to covers the costs of selling the books through their retail stores. “But we still have faith in the book,” she says, noting that National Geographic’s target for book sales is 20,000 copies within two years of release.</p>
<p>National Geographic is handling promotion for the book, and distributing it to bookstores through an arrangement with Random House. Mehring is helping with the promotion by spreading the word by text and email to his extensive list of contacts in the skating industry. “I felt I should be involved because I personally know the people,” he says. </p>
<p>Now that his book is coming out, he says he has “a lot of ideas” for other projects, including another book. But for now, he’s celebrating the book that almost wasn’t, while focusing on editorial and commercial assignments that have him shooting portraits, lifestyle, and of course, skating. </p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[The local car dealership TV spot is a staple of American advertising. A salesman in a powdered wig promoting a President’s Day blowout; an athlete or hometown hero awkwardly reciting a pre-scripted pitch; an infectiously corny jingle and bellows of, “Zero percent APR and no money down!” They are big, loud, rife with gimmicks, and yet endearing—exhibitions of local flavor even a cynic can identify with.
<p>But as the financial requirements for high production values continue to drop, local dealerships can now mimic the sleek, luxurious look of national car advertisements. Still, even with 4K aerial footage and the use of RED cameras, a spot is only as effective as the story being told—and for a local car dealership, the regional familiarity they convey. Kyle Doyle carefully considered both as he shot <em><a href="https://vimeo.com/127440795">The Grandmaster</a></em>, a short film assigned by a Long Island BMW dealership. The film and accompanying series of spots promoting <a href="http://www.competitionbmw.com/">the Competition BMW dealership in Smithtown, New York</a>, is a prime example of brand promotion through storytelling, and its success hinges on footage of Long Island’s serene North Fork. </p>
<p>Doyle produced, directed and wrote the eight-minute film and the spots for Long Island marketing agency <a href="http://www.moreypublishing.com/">Morey Publishing</a>, which counts Competition BMW as one of its accounts. Doyle’s short film centers on a father and daughter’s journey from the New York City borough of Queens to the edges of the rural North Fork in search of information about the father’s own father, who once beat a chess grandmaster in a local tournament.</p>
<p>Jon Sasala, Morey Publishing’s creative director, says the agency wasn’t interested in producing a typical spot touting prices and picturesque cars. “We wanted to generate leads through storytelling. We wanted to connect with Long Islanders and tell a story they would relate with, and hopefully get them to identify with Competition as a brand, as opposed to just thinking of them as another BMW dealer.”</p>
<p><em>The Grandmaster</em> was Doyle’s most narrative-driven project to date. While chess — a symbol of competition — was always central to the project, Doyle retooled Morey Publishing’s initial idea (about a son skirting an awards ceremony in his honor to play chess with his father) into a road trip tale that more prominently featured the car. </p>
<p>The film has a classic, cinematic feel. Cinematographer <a href="https://vimeo.com/williamtracy">William Babcock</a> affixed re-housed P+S Technick Super Baltars to his RED Dragon, a concession he made after being unable to find any Lomo anamorphic glass (Super Baltars were used on the first two <em>Godfather </em>films, and more recently, the Ron Howard Formula One film <em>Rush</em>). Much of the footage between the father and daughter was handheld, Doyle says, with Babcock seated on an apple box. The look is gauzy and tranquil (several sequences are in slow motion), but the slight shake of the camera grounds <em>The Grandmaster</em> and reinforces the impromptu nature of the trip.</p>
<p>The footage of the car, however, is slick and grand. For a 3/4-angle shot of the BMW speeding forward, Babcock affixed a Ronin gimbal stabilizer to the back of a lead car using a DIY hitch mount built by key grip Keith Ferriera.</p>
<p>“We were able to have a remote head while doing these car shots,” says Babcock. “I was in a car trailing and was able to do this move where you could maneuver the camera while it was hitched up to a car, side-mounted, or on a hostess tray.” The hostess tray, too, was crucial in a standout shot of the car pulling into the lot of the vintage Silver Sands motel as the camera swerves out the window up towards its kitschy neon sign (“Everybody was Instagram-ing that,” Doyle jokes).</p>
<p>But <em>The Grandmaster’s</em> most stunning footage came from above. Until recently, a mammoth budget and a helicopter would have been required to film the BMW darting through the Pine Barrens, or out towards the tip of a peninsula, ocean surf crashing on either side of the road. Now there are drones. </p>
<p>Doyle hired <a href="http://www.jakesalyers.com">Jake Salyers</a> to operate his DJI Inspire 1. Neither Doyle nor Babcock had worked with drones before, and while Salyers had practiced all winter trailing the G and F subway trains from the roof of his Brooklyn apartment, this was his first serious gig as an operator. They planned the drone’s route and shooting angles during test shots without the car near the Pine Barrens and Orient Point, but they did not have a specific starting point or speed for the driver when they actually filmed.</p>
<p>“It was more, ‘Come along this stretch and I’ll catch you,’” Salyers says. The crew also battled cold and strong winds, and the Inspire 1’s batteries lasted about 20 minutes. (DJI batteries were backordered, and Salyers only had two). Luck, Salyers admits, contributed to the ultimate success of the aerial shots, but his rooftop practice came in handy during the run-and-gun shoot.</p>
<p>“It’s like maintaining composition on a landscape photograph, while you’re moving through it,” Salyers says of flying the Inspire 1. “There’s not such a tight, specific place that you’re trying to keep on the left third, you’re trying to maintain an elegant landscape photograph for a period of time.”</p>
<p>The stretches of road filmed from above were also relatively deserted, something Doyle—a native Long Islander who’s often explored the North Fork on drives with his wife—knew. Using his own familiarity with the area, and with the help of Google, Doyle was able to track down a number of quaint, quintessential Long Island locales.</p>
<p>“Long Island has a lot of beautiful scenery, but I think sometimes it can be overwhelming because it’s so big,” Doyle says. “And it’s not one thing. I wanted to highlight one area, not get overwhelmed with having them stop at multiple places along the entire length of Long Island, but focus it on one spot so that it felt like it was geographically centered.”</p>
<p>That specificity and familiarity has helped <em>The Grandmaster</em>, and especially its shorter spin-off spots, gain traction amongst Long Islanders. The film was also a component of Morey Publishing’s larger campaign with Competition BMW, which includes a bi-annual magazine, <em>Checkpoint</em>, and a website, <a href="http://checkmate.competitionbmw.com./">Checkmate.CompetitionBMW.com.</a> Jon Sasala praises the film’s high-production values, and notes the film grabbed the attention of the higher-ups at BMW, impressed with the branch’s initiative.</p>
<p>“I wanted to make sure that it was familiar enough to say, ‘Oh I’ve been there,’ or ‘I’ve passed that place,’” Doyle says. “I wanted it to feel not too far away where the audience would feel, ‘Oh I’ve never been there,’ but not too close where it was overly familiar. I wanted it to be some place where they would aspire to take a road trip.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Photographers who publish a book need to market it. That’s true whether you decide to self-publish your book—acting as your own distribution and marketing team—or work with a book publisher. Many publishing contracts stipulate that the photographer has to purchase a certain number of copies, which means that unless you can actively promote your book, you’re likely to end up with a few hundred copies piled in your garage. Having a marketing plan is helpful in other ways: Book editors are more likely to publish a photobook if the photographer understands the potential audience for the book and can organize gallery shows, book signings or other events that will attract buyers. 
<p>A number of veterans of the book publishing business—including many photographers who have self-published books successfully—have shared their advice on how to effectively distribute and market photo books. <strong><a href="https://emeraldexpo.omeda.com/cgi-win/npdn.cgi?mode=gmpage&amp;p=712DIGED">The articles listed here are available at PDNOnline.com to subscribers.</a></strong> </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/bookstores-stmarks">WHAT BOOKSTORES BUY</a></strong></p>
<p><em>PDN </em>surveyed buyers for five independent bookstores around the country—including stores that specialize in art and photography books, and some with large and respected photography sections. They explain the many factors that influence what they stock and how they display books within their stores. These include the idiosyncrasies of their customer base, the reputation of the photographer, positive reviews, gift appeal and even the color of the book’s cover. Bob Contant, co-owner of New York’s <a href="http://www.stmarksbookshop.com/">St. Mark’s Bookshop</a>, describes the books that have turned into perennial favorites, while Cathy Langer, buyer at <a href="http://www.tatteredcover.com/">Tattered Cover</a> in Seattle, names some unexpected bestsellers that she wishes she’d purchased in higher volume. </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/hand-make-book">HOW (AND WHY) TO HAND-MAKE YOUR PHOTO BOOK</a></strong></p>
<p>Fine artists like <a href="http://www.laurenhenkin.com/">Lauren Henkin</a> have found that turning bodies of work into hand-crafted artist’s books has helped them expand the audience for their work by reaching a new base of collectors. “Producing handmade books gives photographers the ability to quickly build and extend their audience beyond the photographic community—to university libraries and rare book and art collectors interested in handmade objects. It can also increase a photographer’s exhibition opportunities,” Henkin writes. In this article, she explains the steps she took to publicize and distribute her book, Displaced, through book festivals and portfolio reviews. </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/what-publicist">WHAT CAN A PUBLICIST DO FOR YOU?</a></strong></p>
<p>Photographers are hiring publicists to perform the tasks that small book publishers or photo galleries don’t have the staff or time to handle. “I’m often working with photographers who are working with smaller publishers,” says publicist <a href="http://www.stampcollaborations.com/">Kate Greenberg</a>. At independent publishing houses, Greenberg notes, “There isn’t a whole machine in place” to manage all contact with the press. To meet publications’ deadlines, publicists expect photographers to supply photos and captions as soon as possible, and then make themselves available for interviews. Photographer Janelle Lynch says working with a publicist helped generate “significantly more online press and announcements,” and adds, “I think that anything in that regard has a potential to help promote not just a book, but a career.” </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/be-your-publicist">HOW TO BE YOUR OWN PUBLICIST</a></strong></p>
<p>Photographers who want to save money on their publicity campaigns can often find freelance publicists willing to work on an hourly basis just to brainstorm ideas for organizing newsworthy events or to think of some publications to contact. But for those photographers willing to put considerable time, effort and energy into running a publicity campaign on their own, <em>PDN</em> asked professional publicists for suggestions on how to research press contacts, plan a calendar, write a press release and follow up with contacts. </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/book-deals">PHOTOGRAPHERS SHARE THE DETAILS OF THEIR RECENT BOOK DEALS</a></strong></p>
<p>How many books will you need to sell? That may depend on the deal you are able to negotiate with the publisher, as well as the size of your print run. Take a look at the arrangements photographers have made in the last two years with their book publishers, and see how many required that the photographers purchase between 30 and 400 copies of the book. </p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Of the many groups formed to support women photographers, one of the newest is Chicago Women in Photography (See <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/Women-Photographers-Find-Strength-in-Numbers-14419.shtml">“Women Photographers Find Strength In Numbers."</a>). It has attracted photographers with a variety of experience, from relative newcomers to established professionals. Among the latter is <a href="http://barbaracrane.desordre.net/">Barbara Crane</a>, described as “the matriarch of Chicago photography” by one of CWIP’s organizers.
<p>A winner of a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1979, Crane has exhibited internationally, and her work is in the permanent collections of the Amon Carter Museum, George Eastman House, the High Museum and other institutions. She says she attended CWIP’s first gathering for the fellowship it offered. “It was exhilarating to go to that meeting with so many women photographers,” says Crane. Making art requires time alone and can be isolating, she says. “I thought it was very reinforcing and invigorating to meet other women who are very involved in their work.” </p>
<p>Crane notes that women now outnumber men in MFA programs, a dramatic change from when she studied with Aaron Siskind at the Institute of Design at the Illinois Institute of Technology. “Aaron always talked about his ‘guys.’ I was not one of the guys,” she says. When she joined the faculty of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1967,  “it was pretty much an all-male department.” </p>
<p>At a speaking engagement years ago, an audience member asked Crane what it was like to work in a male-dominated field. “My answer was truthful but a bit guarded. I said I tried not to be preoccupied by that because I thought it would hurt my work.” Like many women in a workforce surrounded by men, she felt she had to conceal personal details as well as personal feelings. Crane, who raised three children, says, “You didn’t dare talk about your children.” Women were “scrutinized” more than their male colleagues. Crane describes herself as “pretty direct,” but adds, “You had better not be ‘a bitch,’ because that’s what women who were highly motivated were called.” When she brought her work to gallery owners, “I would wear the plainest, most severe suits to look businesslike. I would do anything to avoid giving mixed signals.” She explains, “It was all about having them deal with my work.” </p>
<p>With more women curators, gallery directors and faculty chairs, the culture has changed, Crane says: “You don’t have to worry about what you wear so much.”  However, most exhibitions still feature men, “or if they’re group shows, there are more men than women,” she says. “It’s discouraging that it still goes on, but things certainly have gotten better.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[The development of photography is intimately bound with the development of support gear (those camera obscura were back-breaking). And while tripod technology doesn’t advance at the pace of Moore’s Law, incremental improvements continue. What’s more, the era of DSLR and mirrorless filmmaking has ushered in a surge of innovation around camera gimbals, as sophisticated electronics bring formerly difficult—or downright impossible—handheld shots into the reach of first-time and independent filmmakers.

<p>The <a href="http://amzn.to/1iF4bPS">new aluminum-based 190 Go!</a> is the lightest and most compact member of Manfrotto’s 190 series—and judging by the punctuation, the most excitable too. It’s also the first with twist leg locks that let you open or close all sections of the tripod at once with a single turn of your wrist. The 190 Go! weighs 3.75 pounds, extends to 57.48 inches and collapses down to 17.7 inches when it’s time to pack up and go. It employs Manfrotto’s 90-degree center column, which can be lifted out of the tripod’s top casting and swung into the horizontal position without removing either the tripod head or camera. There are four leg angle options and an Easy Link attachment that lets you connect accessories, like LED lights, that have a 3/8-inch male adapter.</p>

<p><strong>Sirui W-2204 </strong></p>
<p>When the going gets tough, or wet, <a href="http://adorama.evyy.net/c/124294/51926/1036?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2FSIBSRW2204.html">Sirui’s W-2204</a> can keep you going. A series of waterproof rings keeps water from seeping into the tripod’s legs. According to Sirui, the tripod is built from many of the same waterproof and leak-proof materials used in the automotive industry. The tripod’s rubber feet can be swapped out for stainless steel spikes and one leg can be detached as a monopod. There’s a hook beneath the center column for a weight bag for extra stability and a bubble level on the tripod head to guide alignment. The W-2204 extends to 70.9 inches and folds down to 20.5 inches. It can keep up to 39.7 pounds of gear aloft but, thanks to its carbon fiber build, only weighs 3.7 pounds.</p>

<p><strong>MeFoto RoadTrip</strong></p>
<p>Tripods have many virtues, but a sharp sense of style isn’t usually one of them. <a href="http://adorama.evyy.net/c/124294/51926/1036?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2FBEA1350Q1T.html">MeFoto’s RoadTrip</a> injects a bit of panache into the category with a build-your-own option that lets you customize your model with interchangeable colored legs, heads, shoulders and center columns. You have 12 colors to choose from that can be used in up to 792 combinations—enough to satisfy even the most eclectic tastes. No matter your color, the RoadTrip extends up to 61.6 inches and can keep 17.6 pounds of camera and lens in the air. It has two leg angle positions and a recessed center column hook for adding stabilizing weights. The aluminum version weighs 3.6 pounds while the carbon fiber edition weighs 3.1 pounds. The RoadTrip has a removable leg that you can combine with the center column to form a monopod, and a colorful one at that. </p>

<p>The big challenge in using <a href="http://www.reallyrightstuff.com/TVC-34L-Versa-series-3-4-sections-leg-long.html">the TVC-34</a> isn’t carrying the 4.4-pound carbon fiber tripod around, but finding enough gear that can actually make it break a sweat. The TVC-34 can hold up to 50 pounds of gear and has the highest stiffness-to-load ratio of any of the company’s carbon fiber tripods. You can extend the TVC-34 to 58.4 inches tall or contract it down to 3.9 inches. It folds up into a carry-on friendly 21.2 inches.

<p>The B<a href="http://www.beeworksgear.com/shop/bw05-pro-stabilization">eeWorks BW05</a> is a lightweight, three-axis stabilizer that’s just as easily mounted to a wall or tabletop as it is placed in the hands of a camera operator. It features internal HDMI cabling so you can feed camera video to a separate monitor mounted to the handlebars. It’s light, too, at just over 4 pounds, and can mount mirrorless cameras like the Panasonic GH4 or Sony’s A7 series. The BW05 kit includes a stand, handlebar, mini ball head monitor mount, battery and charger. The optional $999 Kinetic remote lets you control the BW05 through gestures when the gimbal isn’t in your hands, wirelessly transmitting your motion to the BW05. You can even adjust the sensitivity of the BW05 gimbal to your Kinetic remote movements to mimic the impact of heavier or ?lighter cameras.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://amzn.to/1iF5AFS">Ronin M</a> is a slimmed down, less-expensive and more approachable version of the original Ronin. It weighs just 5 pounds—half the weight of the original—but can support cameras up to 8 pounds, thanks to a new magnesium frame. You mount your DSLR or video camera and the gimbal balances itself, ensuring that your camera stays steady even as you move about. The M offers three shooting positions—briefcase, upright and underslung—for framing a variety of shots plus a silent mode that reduces the sound of the motors when you need to go stealth. The M’s settings can be remotely adjusted via Bluetooth and a mobile device. The battery is good for up to six hours of use. When you’re done, you can twist off the top handles to shrink down the M for transport.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[When we asked photographer Maggie Steber if women photographers have more flexibility than they once did to have both a family and a career [<a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/Photographer-Maggie-Steber-on-Women-Minorities-and-How-to-Nurture-Talent-14470.shtml ">in our September issue</a>], she challenged us to ask that question of men. 
<p>“Men have a lot to say about it,” Steber said. So we asked several US-based photographers, and indeed they had much to say. Here’s what they told us. </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.alanschin.com/">ALAN CHIN</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Brooklyn, NY</strong></p>
<p><strong>One daughter, aged 18 months</strong></p>
<p>I would say that it would have been hard to be both the kind of father I want to be with the kind of photographer I used to be—and would still want to be: the constantly-on-the-road, bang-bang guy--but the work dried up before I ever had a child. So, these days, yes, [fatherhood and work are] compatible, because there's just less work.</p>
<p>I feel very lucky. I had a very good career for when I was very young. I had a hot 10 years between the ages of 25 and 35. I got to do a lot of the things that I always wanted to do. I got the tail end of the days when you could be a globe-trotting photographer. [Publications] would fly you business class on assignments. </p>
<p>The one thing I have given up, for the moment, is the ability to base myself somewhere where's there's both more work and a low cost of living, which I would be doing if it weren't for parenthood. For example, somewhere like Kiev, Cairo or Guangzhou, all places where there's actually more demand than supply of quality photojournalism and writing.</p>
<p>But I am a native New Yorker, and I want my daughter to have a good childhood. We have very good services here — great schools, great daycare, great parks. It would be hard to get this quality of services somewhere else for so little money. </p>
<p>If I didn’t have to make a living, and if I had an unlimited amount of money, I would be very happy to not work very much. I could do what a lot of traditionally higher income family mothers do. I’m not saying that there aren’t aspects of [stay-at-home parenting] that I find very troubling. But on a certain level, I really enjoy spending the day with my daughter. </p>
<p>In an ideal, fantasy world, I’d be with her all of the time.</p>
<p>One thing I’ve also learned is that for men, it’s a luxury to even think about becoming a full-time parent. Even if I did decide to stay home with my daughter, I’d know I was only doing it for a finite amount of time. Once they’re at school, they’re at school. For a man, it’s a lot easier to rejoin the workforce after three or four years. Women can’t necessarily do that.</p>
<p>My partner and I have our daughter in daycare 4 days a week. But sometimes she’s with me. For example, I have an assignment this weekend for the <em>New York Times</em> real estate section. I’ll probably take the baby with me.</p>
<p>Even though she can walk and scream, having her on set makes the shoot better. People are not threatened by a photographer with a child. When you represent the<em> New York Times</em> or <em>Time</em>, it can be intimidating. But with a child on set, people start laughing so much. The only problem is that you have to get them to stop being goofy. But that’s a good problem to have.</p>
<p>Most jobs, you can’t have your child on set. You’re on a deadline, or you’re traveling. But certainly for a small percentage where it’s local and relatively relaxed, it’s possible.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://matteichphoto.com/">MATT EICH</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Charlottesville, Virginia </strong></p>
<p><strong>Two daughters, aged 3 and 8</strong></p>
<p>It helps that my wife is not a photographer or an artist and holds a normal job with normal-ish hours. [She’s a speech pathologist in the public school system.] My world as a freelancer is relative chaos where I don't know month-to-month if I will have any work or too much work to handle.</p>
<p>I was [talking] with young “successful” photographers in a group earlier this year. Every single one of us had someone in our life with a stable job. This is kind of the reason that I can fuck around and make art. It’s very difficult for people when both folks are artists.</p>
<p>My wife and I end up bringing in about the same amount each year, though much of my income goes directly back into personal work. When I am home from assignments and MFA studies [at the University of Hartford], I do my best to be available to help out with everything I can, whether its picking up kids, doing dinner, bedtime, etc. so that Melissa can catch up on work. When I am gone she functions as a working single mother, so I have total admiration for her and feel the need to repay this to the best of my ability.</p>
<p>As the kids get older it becomes more painful to be away, and more taxing on my wife as she juggles their individual needs and her full-time job. This has necessitated a shift in my work and my life and is part of what led me to an MFA program. My hope is that I can begin teaching as a baseline income and accepting select assignments in order to be home more. In this scenario I would give up traveling and wandering the country on a whim in exchange for some semblance of stability.</p>
<p>That initial joy I derived from being a freelance photographer is no longer there. It’s counteracted by a sense of guilt. “I shouldn’t be here, I should be somewhere else.” Damned if you do, damned if you don’t. If I’m at home, I know I should be pitching so I can go make some money.</p>
<p>I’ve been putting everything I have into the work for 10 years – it’s not enough to sustain a family, or to justify such a sacrifice. A lot of the people I admire manage to balance careers as teachers and artists. It requires a specific kind of focus not to get too sucked into whatever system you’re a part of so that it detracts from the work.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.chiplitherland.com/">CHIP LITHERLAND</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sarasota, Florida </strong></p>
<p><strong>Two daughters, aged 7 and 13</strong></p>
<p>Right now I’m the primary breadwinner — my wife is a freelance photographer as well. We worked on the staff of the <em>Herald Tribune</em> in Sarasota, Florida, for about a decade together. I left the paper and went freelance about 5 years ago. She stayed on at the newspaper and kept the insurance while I got my business off the ground. Then, about a year and a half ago, she left the newspaper as well. She helps me run my business, and does the financials.</p>
<p>While she was still at the newspaper, I was the one watching our youngest daughter. She was a toddler. I pretty much had to be on the whole time. From 9-5 I was a stay-at-home dad and at night, I was a freelance photographer, trying to build a business. I took a lot of client phone calls while keeping my eye on my daughter through the window.</p>
<p>I’ve made a really conscious decision to take jobs that are really worth it. I don’t really go after low paying jobs anymore.  I don’t want to be away from my kid for a couple of hundred dollars. If that means I have to work fewer days per year, then I’m ok with that. Before I take a job, I usually have a conversation with my wife. We discuss: “Is it something that will push the business forward? Then yes, let’s do it.”</p>
<p>I usually travel three to four times a month. On average, five to ten nights, I’m in a hotel. A lot of the time the travel is just in Florida. In June, I was gone for three weeks. My wife and the kids took a vacation while I was gone. They went to visit grandma and grandpa. Sometimes my wife comes along with me on shoots to assist on lighting. We’ll connect in a city where my parents are so they can take care of the kids. It’s a group effort for my entire family. </p>
<p>I don’t see it as the man must go out and work. If my wife told me she wanted to go off for two months, I would be totally supportive. I would not accept work during that time. I absolutely feel like we’re both partners. We fully support each other’s craft. We have to kind of go with the punches.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.benjaminlowy.com/">BENJAMIN LOWY</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Northern New Jersey</strong></p>
<p><strong>Two sons, aged 4 and 6</strong></p>
<p>Is my career as a photojournalist compatible with fatherhood? It just depends. You have to decide, are you a responsible parent, or are you a photographer who also wants to be a responsible parent? </p>
<p>Some things have definitely changed. I am not running off to Syria anymore – or in general running after breaking news events in the same way as the past. I don’t have the kind of lifestyle where I’m sleeping on a couch. I have a house in New Jersey, a mortgage, and a gym membership. I take my kids to soccer practice.</p>
<p>When I met my wife, she was also working as a photojournalist. Her name is <a href="http://www.oneintwenty.org/marvi-lacar/">Marvi Lacar</a>. She doesn’t do as much travel editorial work anymore. She made a decision that she didn’t want to [pursue assignments] in the same way that I do. We came to the conclusion that if I was going to keep on working with the same high profile assignments, one of the things that I wouldn’t do are personal projects. If someone isn’t sending me to Libya, I’m not going there. </p>
<p>I take projects based on how much money they pay. I try to take the assignments I get, and make them my own. For example, I was sent by <em>Harper’s Magazine</em> to cover the Sochi Olympics. While I was there, I was able to produce work I'm happy with. </p>
<p>I’ve definitely also had to branch out into doing other things besides straight photojournalism.  </p>
<p>Marvi and I have started directing television commercials together. I find the joy is still there when I can use my ability to make an image speak. I can get that in many different ways. It’s the experience of doing it that I love. </p>
<p>I still want to cover the refugee crisis in Syria. It’s the drive in my soul. I’m sure if I went, I could pick up assignments from publications. But it’s a gamble I’ve sort of been unwilling to take.</p>
<p>I’ve definitely lost some opportunities. There was a client recently who wanted to send me to Afghanistan for a fairly dangerous assignment. It seemed dangerous for the sake of being dangerous. It wasn’t for me. They never called me again. I've been <span style="color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff;">doing a lot of adventure work as a way to get that </span><span style="color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff;">passion</span><span style="color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff;"> I used to get from conflict photography. That </span><span style="color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff;">adventure</span><span style="color: #222222; background-color: #ffffff;"> is the same, but it’s much safer. </span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.ruddyroye.com/">RUDDY ROYE</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Brooklyn, NY </strong></p>
<p><strong>Two sons, aged 7 and 10</strong></p>
<p>I see myself as a parent first. Photography is how I feed my family, and further down the road, how I feed my soul [<a href="http://pdnpulse.pdnonline.com/2015/03/pdn-video-ruddy-roye-instagram-storytelling-risking-angry-black-man-label.html">such as with projects on Instagram</a>], but first and foremost I am a dad.</p>
<p>I didn’t expect this at all. I thought I could take a couple of months off then run back to photography. But it has not been like that. If you tell yourself that you want to be a parent then there must be an opportunity cost [ie, a sacrifice]. </p>
<p>I think I might fit different criteria than some of my peers because I don’t get as many assignments. My sacrifice is making my sons [who are 10 and 7] feel like what their dad is going through does not need to be their story. I do that by being present for them. I support all their dreams and I tell them the truth. </p>
<p>My wife is an assistant principal. I spent the first three years of my eldest son’s life at home because we couldn’t afford daycare. That was difficult. But I prefer to miss assignments rather than moments in my children’s lives. What I have done recently is try to find work between dropping my boys off at 8am and picking them back up at 3pm.</p>
<p>I see a lot of fathers in the park at all hours of the day, which tells me more dads are staying home. I have no idea why this is, all I know is being a dad first has allowed me the distraction--or better yet, the space--where I can recoup my pride and maintain my sanity.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[The website of the TV network <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/">Al Jazeera America</a>, publishes breaking news, in-depth reporting, and photo-heavy features on a variety of national and international topics. <em>PDN</em> asked director of photography Mark Rykoff about how he and deputy photo editor Vaughn Wallace find, assign and showcase photo essays. 
<p>Rykoff has more than 25 years of experience in the photo industry. He worked at <em>TIME</em> magazine—putting in four years at its Moscow bureau—and oversaw the picture desk of the <em>TIME </em>website from 2007–2011.</p>
<p>He has worked in book publishing with Against All Odds Productions, managing the photography for the books <em><a href="http://thehumanfaceofbigdata.com/">The Human Face of Big Data</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Day-Life-China-David-Cohen/dp/0002153211">A Day in the Life of China.</a></em> He joined Al Jazeera America in 2013.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Who’s the audience for the website? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Rykoff: </strong>I think it’s a diverse set of people. We’ve written about a wide range of topics, and what we’ve learned about the Internet is that topics find their niche. For example, we’ve developed a big audience among Native Americans because we’ve written often about Native American communities. We did a story about the delta of Mississippi where the blues originated, and how that’s become tourist-ified and who’s making money from it. It got picked up by musician Buddy Guy, who posted it on Facebook, so we reached people who didn’t know we existed. We’re hoping to find audience members in places outside the media bubbles on the coasts. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How is the website related to the Al Jazeera America network?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MR: </strong>Al Jazeera came into the American market two years ago and bought Current TV, Al Gore’s old network, with the goal of bringing the Al Jazeera style of journalism to American soil. Like every TV station these days, they needed a website, but they quickly understood that in the American market a website that just mimics the TV station doesn’t help build an audience. From the beginning we were operating independently of the station. It’s a different medium, and they realized the needs of a Web story and the needs of a TV story are different.</p>
<p>We try to complement each other. We might say to the TV side: We are working on this story that might be interesting for you, and the photographer may be able to provide video, then the television side might use it. Or, they’ll say: We’re going out to pursue a story and we’ll provide written text that might go on the website.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: You run a lot of long photo essays on the site. How do they support the editorial mission?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MR:</strong> When we started here, they presented to us an editorial ethos, what we call the DNA of Al Jazeera: straightforward news journalism without a lot of celebrity coverage. They also wanted people to watch the network, so they said we don’t want a lot of videos available on the website. For visuals, that meant we were going to need a lot of photography. I was the lucky soul who was tasked with finding that. At first I was the only photo editor on an organization chart of 60 people working on the website. I pushed to provide photojournalism that matched that editorial ethos. </p>
<p>When I thought, “How do I do this?” I took inspiration from <em>LIFE</em> magazine from the 1950s: Straightforward storytelling photography, stories that have a beginning, a middle and an end, stories with a human interest at the center of them. I should add that the idea was to do that in color on a digital platform.</p>
<p>A phrase that’s used around here often is that the editorial content is giving voice to the voiceless, so the subjects of the stories would be people in America whose voices aren’t often heard in the media.</p>
<p>That ethos guided the look I described and the decisions about the photographers I hired. I’ve worked in photojournalism for a long time, both at <em>TIME</em> and working with Rick Smolan to photo edit the <em>Day in the Life of</em> books. I had a huge Rolodex of photographers who can work in that style. </p>
<p>I’m now joined at the photo desk by Vaughn Wallace, who came from <em>TIME</em>, and he has brought another, younger batch of photographers. We’ve developed what I think is a pretty distinctive look. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: The design of the website displays photo essays well.</strong></p>
<p><strong>MR: </strong>One of the nice things about working here is that we’re small and very nimble. When I first brought in some of the photo essays, the team here said that we need to make space for this. So they designed templates to display photography well. The photo-rich stories you’ve seen are on a layout that uses Tarbell, an open-source publishing tool designed by David Eads, who used to be at the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> and now builds news applications for NPR Visuals. We like working with Tarbell so much we have photos of Ida Tarbell around the newsroom. </p>
<p><a href="http://projects.aljazeera.com/2015/05/birmingham-bus/">Carolyn Drake’s story, “The Route of Division of a Birmingham Bus”</a> [about a bus line in Birmingham, Alabama that carries housekeepers from a poor black neighborhood to a wealthy white suburb] was displayed on a Tarbell template with some additional coding because the photographer shot medium-format and the Tarbell template was designed to accommodate 35mm.</p>
<p>Vaughn brought that story in, and when he first showed it to me, I liked meeting those ladies and I liked hearing their stories. It’s a very human story. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Do you think medium-format helped that story?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MR: </strong>When we first started we were trying for a traditional photojournalistic look, which is typically 35mm. But now that we’ve established our visual identity, Vaughn and I are trying to expand the vocabulary without losing the vision of storytelling. Vaughn recently worked with a photographer, <a href="http://www.daniellevillasana.com/">Danielle Villasana</a>, on <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/multimedia/2015/6/peru-arsenic.html">a piece about arsenic poisoning in wells in Peru</a>. We liked the story and thought if you go out to do a story in the Peruvian Andes, it’ll look interesting. While she was there, she also wanted to try some double-exposure portraits and we thought that was cool. You can’t see the poison in the water, so the portraits were a way of adding a narrative layer.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: A lot of documentary photographers are trying to expand the vocabulary of their medium, it seems. </strong></p>
<p><strong>MR: </strong>Many of them are doing all kinds of interesting things. We get pitches from photographers shooting in many different styles. As an editor at a news organization, I have to ask: Is this the best way to tell the story? Is it appropriate to the story we want to tell? We’re trying to stay true to a very straightforward newsgathering ethos.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How much of the photography you publish is assigned, and how much of it is from completed projects the photographer has submitted?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MR:</strong> There are a lot of day-to-day, breaking-news stories we’re working on, too. But in terms of the photo-rich stories, we find them in different ways. An interesting thing about working in this newsroom that’s been a great experience for me is that we do some things the traditional way: The editors send a writer to a place and say, “Do you want to send a photographer along?” </p>
<p>We’ve also had photographers bring us ideas. Many of the photo-heavy stories you see on the site originated with the photo desk. For example, <a href="http://projects.aljazeera.com/2015/01/underground-beijing/">“The Rat Tribe of Beijing,”</a> the story about Beijing basement dwellers: <a href="http://www.chiyinsim.com/">Sim Chi Yin</a> brought that to us, and we helped her find a writer she was comfortable working with. </p>
<p>About 25 percent of the stories come from a photographer saying, “I’ve been working on this project, I have a few pictures. Would you be interested in taking it to the next stage?” A smaller percentage are already completed, shot and captioned. I have called the photographer and said, “We’d like to run the story but we’d like the voice of the subjects: Can you put us in touch with them?” We would send a writer later to follow in the photographer’s footsteps.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you like to edit? </strong></p>
<p><strong>MR:</strong> I like to get as much material from the photographer as possible. If you want to send 1,000 photos, I’m happy to go through them. They give me a better sense of what the story is and the context in which it happened. And I’ve found that photographers are not the best editors of their own work; there are photos they haven’t sent because they have some personal issue with them but they work well with the story. I’ll pass back an edit of 50 or 60 images and say, “What do you think?”</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: I know many people who turn to Al Jazeera for international reporting, and you seem to run a lot of overseas stories. </strong></p>
<p><strong>MR:</strong> At Al Jazeera America we look for stories in America. We have a sister site based in Qatar that has [international] expertise and we can link to them. But quite frequently we get overseas stories that we think will interest the American audience. <a href="http://www.moniquejaques.com/">Monique Jaques</a> contacted me from her base in Istanbul and said, “There’s this Miss Muslimah pageant happening in a week in Indonesia.” We huddled the editors and they greenlighted it in a minute, then they scrambled to find a writer in Indonesia. That story found a huge audience, so that was the right instinct. </p>
<p><a href="http://glennagordon.com/">Glenna Gordon</a> is awesome. She pitched us a story about a 14-year-old Nigerian who had been forced into marriage and was accused of murdering her husband. She contacted us exactly when were discussing how to cover forced marriages of underage brides. She also did a story for us about the training of the Liberian army. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: You seem to have worked with a lot of women photographers. </strong></p>
<p><strong>MR: </strong><a href="http://www.taratw.com/">Tara Todras-Whitehill</a> did a story about how many women were elected mayor in their villages in Turkey during the country’s previous elections. She pitched and executed beautifully a story about a workshop to inspire tech startups in Gaza, and the winners of its competition. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.katebrooks.com/">Kate Brooks</a> did a story about the human toll of rhino poaching. A kind of mafia has formed in South Africa to provide protection for the poachers and get their goods out. She’s very interested in the poaching problem. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.katieorlinsky.com/">Katie Orlinsky</a> has done a few stories for us out of Alaska. And very early on, before the mass kidnapping of students in Guerrero, Mexico, she did a story about how villagers were forming militias to defend themselves against drug lords. She captures the spirit of people in a straightforward manner and she’s got a great storytelling sense. </p>
<p>I love <a href="http://tonigreaves.com/">Toni Greaves</a> in Portland, Oregon. She has a wonderful way with people. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: You seem to work repeatedly with certain photographers. Are you looking for new photographers?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MR: </strong>Always. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you look for them? </strong></p>
<p><strong>MR:</strong> We get agencies calling us. There are cases where I have a story in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, and I start digging around on Wonderful Machine, Blink, Photoshelter, even Lightstalkers. We get a lot of things over the transom, and I like to keep track of people in unusual locations. I get a lot of pitches from Bangkok and Istanbul, but if I’m contacted by someone in Burkina Faso, I’ll make a note of it.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How should photographers in Burkina Faso contact you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MR:</strong> “Hi, I’m in Burkina Faso.” They list the media outlets they’ve worked for or send a sample of their work. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What makes a good story pitch?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MR:</strong> First of all, it fits our editorial ethos. It’s about something in the news but under-reported. It has human interest and it has a beginning, middle and end. And it gives you a handle on what the photographer will see in the field. You get some pitches that are very theoretical and you think: What will you photograph? </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What makes a bad pitch? </strong></p>
<p><strong>MR:</strong> We get a lot of what we call typologies: “Ten portraits of homeless people.” They’re beautiful, but we need some way to contextualize them. A standalone portfolio like that doesn’t work for us. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Can you explain to our readers where you draw the line between keeping you up to date on new work, and stalking you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MR:</strong> I may not respond to an email right away, but I read every email that comes in my inbox, whether it’s “Here’s a shoot I did for Texas Monthly” or “I’ll be traveling to” a certain place.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[In her quirky, surrealist scenes depicting a female character, <a href="http://www.maiaflore.com/">Maia Flore</a> hints at entire worlds beyond the grasp of the naked eye. She uses photography’s association with the real and visible to ask the viewer to suspend their disbelief and consider that beyond or adjacent to what we see, there are alternate stories unfolding.
<p>“In my pictures I always try to think that there are other layers,” says the French-born artist. “Like in people; when you meet them, you always meet the surface and the shape.” Flore is more interested in the “different types of people” she believes we all have in us. “It’s much more this invisible part that I want to explore,” she explains.</p>
<p>In Flore’s images we see her central character, a red-haired girl, with masts growing out of her back, floating from a beach into the air under full sails. In another image she seems to dive from a stage into a set backdrop painted with rolling hills. She buries her head in a field of pristine, white snow. She sits wearing a white blindfold in front of a wall covered in Victorian painted portraits.</p>
<p>Flore uses herself as a model in her work, but she’s careful to obscure her face. “I don’t feel that I’m talking about me,” she explains. “If there is no face [the viewer] can enter into the picture more easily.” While she’s reaching for a more universal character, like any creator of fiction she incorporates elements of her personal life and experience in her images. Those autobiographical connections diminish through her lengthy creative process, she says, as does her memory of her original inspiration for an image.</p>
<p>Flore begins her process by sketching or creating collages, and it can be months or even years between the time she imagines an image and when she actually makes it. To make her composites, she gathers landscape photographs with a Canon EOS 5D Mark II during her travels, then later photographs herself and the props she needs to build the final composition. She often photographs the landscapes without knowing what she will use the images for. To create other images in camera, she’ll stage scenes in a landscape or interior.</p>
<p>When she does stage an image, she prefers to work alone, she says, because she feels more free to experiment. She did collaborate with her grandmother on a series depicting a girl in a red coat, asking her grandmother—who rarely left her home anymore—to scout locations in the countryside near where she lived.</p>
<p>Earlier this year Flore published her first monograph, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.fr/Rememories-Georgia-Frances-King/dp/2330050550">Rememories</a></em>, a result of winning <a href="http://prixhsbc.evenium.com/site/prix-hsbc-pour-la-photographie-development-module;jsessionid=hrywE3h!gQ-IsDhHeyRr3d8f.gl2">the Prix HSBC Pour La Photographie</a>. The book includes images from several series, but it was important to Flore that her book did not simply collect her work like a catalogue. Instead she edited the images together into a cohesive body of work with a subtle, emotional narrative. When she began creating photographs there was a lightness to the work, she says, but she’s begun exploring darker, more emotionally intense images, which she often makes using interiors rather than natural landscapes. “Beauty can also come from these hard moments or ugly times,” she explains. “I would like to be able to speak with many different kinds of feelings.”</p>
<p>A graphic artist and art director by training, Flore came to photography after studying retouching. “I wasn’t really into photography, because for me it was definitely something that was more documentary, more realistic,” she recalls, whereas she didn’t want to see “reality [just] as it is.” She was creating drawings and collages, but wasn’t happy with the result. “Then I studied photography and that’s the way I found that is was possible to make [my ideas] happen.”</p>
<p>Staged and composited photographs appealed to her because viewers might initially believe what they see, rather than noticing the intervention of the artist, as they would with other media. “When you look at a photograph, [especially one] in color, you think that it’s something that happened,” she explains. “It’s fun to play with this: It’s sometimes a quirky situation that could be possible but it’s in some way kind of surreal.”</p>
<p>Flore chose “Rememories” for the title of her book because, for her, it signifies “the idea that we are always playing our childhood memories” over and over again throughout our lives until “at some point you find the end” and move on. “I like this idea that we’re always going through the same path and situation until we find ourselves maybe more open, or we explore something” and move beyond that cycle.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[South African gays and lesbians continue to be subject to violent persecution, despite the country’s official policy of acceptance. Homophobes have beaten a number of gays and lesbians to death, and raped lesbians in order to “cure” them. Since 2006, <a href="http://www.stevenson.info/artists/muholi.html">Zanele Muholi</a> has chosen to confront the violence by making more than 250 portraits of queer black “participants” that humanize and empower them. The series, <a href="http://www.stevenson.info/exhibitions/muholi/index_faces2014.html">“Faces and Places,”</a> has earned her international acclaim not only for her photography, but for her courageous advocacy and activism on behalf of homosexuals and transgender people in South Africa.
<p>“We are at a period where there’s a high level of homophobia in [parts of Africa]. A lot of people have been killed, a lot of people have been displaced, simply because of who they are,” Muholi explained during a conversation about her work with Aperture executive director Chris Boot at the <a href="http://www.look3.org/">LOOK3 photo festival in June</a>. “So what I’m bring to do here is to bring about a kind of tool in which we speak about these atrocities…I just want to change visual history in ways that have never been done in Africa.”</p>
<p>Muholi, who was born in 1972, is propelled by her rage, but also by her optimistic belief in the power of her community to gain acceptance by telling their own stories. In 2002, she co-founded Forum for Empowerment of Women. In 2009, she started a media collective called <a href="http://inkanyiso.org/">Inkanyiso</a> as a platform for queer “born frees” (the term for South Africans born after the end of apartheid) to document their own history through writing, photography and video. Muholi provides cameras to some of the contributors. “One cannot do these projects alone which is why I invited people to come on board and work with me. And it means it’s not lonely anymore,” she says. </p>
<p>Most of the Inkanyiso team are black lesbians. Muholi says the project was inspired in part by a particularly brutal murder of a lesbian in Kwa Thema, a township near Johannesburg that has a significant gay population—but also a lot of hate crimes, despite South Africa’s official acceptance of gays. Posts on the Inkanyiso site include photos and stories about art, activism, queer politics, and personal essays. “People get to read about sex, people get to read about anything you will never see in the mainstream media,” she says. </p>
<p>An important mission of Inkanyiso is to document evidence of so-called “corrective” rape and other hate crimes against lesbians and gays. As she explained in a five-minute documentary film about her work screened before her talk at LOOK3, “Hate crimes have become a binding factor for the LGBTI communities. We come together to give support, or to confirm that somebody has been killed…Do we always go and attend [a] funeral and [then] go home and wait for another funeral? You have to document! You are forced to document!”</p>
<p>Besides documenting crimes against lesbians, though, Inkanyiso’s many contributors also portray themselves and their day-to-day lives in positive ways. Muholi observes in the film, “Projecting positivity can sometimes lead to change. Projecting violations and brutality could lead to further violence. So I think we need to find a balance in which to project these realities.”</p>
<p>Part and parcel of her activism is her ongoing “Faces and Phases” series. It has contributed significantly to her consciousness-raising efforts by drawing international attention. Steidl published <em><a href="https://steidl.de/flycms/Books/Faces-and-Phases-0220273133.html">Faces and Phases 2006–2014</a></em> last March. The book earned her a nomination for the 2015 Deutsche B&ouml;rse Photography Prize. The project also features prominently in <a href="https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/zanele_muholi">her first major solo exhibition in the U.S., called “Isibonelo/Evidence,” which is on display at the Brooklyn Museum through November.</a> </p>
<p>“Faces and Phases” is one of several projects undertaken by Muholi to challenge the portrayal of gays in South Africa since she took up photography more than a decade ago. She completed her studies in advanced photography at the Market Photo Workshop in Johannesburg in 2003. In 2009, three years after starting the “Faces and Phases” project, she earned her MFA in Documentary Media at Ryerson University in Toronto. In 2013, she won a slew of international prizes and honors, including Carnegie International’s Fine Prize for an emerging artist, the Prince Claus Award (sponsored by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs), and the Index on Censorship’s Freedom of Expression award. </p>
<p>The power of Muholi’s portraits lies in the intimacy of the individual images, as well as the collective force of the series. She photographs only people she knows personally, and presents none of them as icons or types, much less victims. Instead she emphasizes their individuality. </p>
<p>Muholi refers to them as “participants” rather than “subjects” as a way of acknowledging their agency and their role in her success, she says. “The minute you say ‘subjects,’ you are not allowed to connect with the person you photograph. I make sure I connect and try to relate to the people I photograph in my work,” she said at LOOK3. </p>
<p>She shoots in black and white for its sense of timelessness, and seeks out simple backgrounds and good natural light in the nooks and crannies of the neighborhoods where she photographs. Her participants come as they are, and look directly into her camera, showing everything from shy reserve to defiance.</p>
<p>Muholi takes her time. “I listen, which is what we need to do as photographers, is to listen to the people we photographer, and not rush to take images,” she says. “In an hour’s time, I take maybe ten shots, looking for one that speaks to me, [and I] give the rest to the participant.” She gives the participants the opportunity to write their own story to accompany the portraits, “so when you look at each and every face, you should think of that person’s story.”  The stories of several of the participants are included in the book <em>Faces and Phases 2006–2014</em>. </p>
<p>Muholi’s plan is to continue the project for life, photographing her participants at intervals to show their evolution as people—hence, the “phases” in the title of the project. But her work—and growing public profile—are not without risks. She is a target of homophobia not only for being a lesbian, but for her unflinching activism. In 2012, thieves stole five years’ worth of work—and nothing else—from her Cape Town apartment. Muholi is undeterred. She presses on urgently, and speaks fearlessly of using her work to “disrupt the perpetrator” and of “disorganizing the mindset of the homophobe.”</p>
<p>And she’s optimistic that she and her fellow activists will prevail. “I’m positive about the future. I was born in South Africa at the height of apartheid. But all the challenges does not mean we can slow down. We cannot delay in any way. But I have hope that hate crime will end, just the way apartheid ended.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[As the Syrian Civil War continues into its fifth year, the statistical measurements of human misery grow apace. According to the United Nations, 220,000 people had been killed as of January 2015, and 130,000 more were declared “missing/captured.” Nearly 4 million Syrians have fled the country, while an estimated 7.5 million citizens have been internally displaced. With the conflict showing no signs of abating, Syria’s situation is made even more troubling by the plight of its youth. UNESCO’s 2015 global report indicates that almost half of adolescents inside the country, and a staggering 90 percent of refugee children, are “out of school.” As Syria’s history is being bombed into rubble, and its present held hostage by war, the future of its people is in dire jeopardy. 
<p><a href="http://www.ushmm.org/confront-genocide/cases/syria/syrias-lost-generation">“Syria’s Lost Generation” is a multimedia installation</a> by Los Angeles-based photographer <a href="http://elenadorfman.com/">Elena Dorfman</a> on view at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum through January 2016. The exhibit uses intimate environmental portraits and audio recordings of teenage Syrian refugees to push beyond the grim statistics and bleak images emerging from the civil war. “There is extraordinary [photojournalistic] work being made in the region and about this crisis,” Dorfman explains. “My hope, in focusing on the teenagers, was to entice the viewer to look at the subject not as another staggering number, but as someone they might connect with and have empathy for.”</p>
<p>At first blush, this work seems like a departure for Dorfman, a successful fine-art photographer who has published several monographs and has shown her work at MoMA and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. On closer inspection, however, “Syria’s Lost Generation” follows a persistent thread in Dorfman’s work: marginalized communities.  </p>
<p>Dorfman’s opportunity to create the project arose in 2013, when she reconnected with a former employer from her days as a young photojournalist in the 1990s at the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>. Now a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, her former colleague said “they could use my eye” for the work they were doing around the Syrian refugee crisis, Dorfman remembers. “My first thought was no, I’m a fine-art photographer, that’s not the type of work I do.” </p>
<p>But the more Dorfman thought about the proposal over the next few days, the more she was drawn to it. The urgency of the Syrian situation, combined with her own desire to “get out of her studio and engage the world,” made the assignment difficult to pass up.</p>
<p>In March 2013, Dorfman arrived in Beirut, where she was based until September. The U.N. collaboration also took her to camps outside Lebanon, in Turkey, Iraqi Kurdistan and Jordan. Her assignments ranged from in-depth reporting, such as a three-month study of war widows, to straightforward coverage of specific U.N. projects, like refugee housing. Whether in Jordan’s sprawling, semi-permanent Za’atari refugee camp, replete with street names and bustling commercial hubs, or in a dank, rented basement in southern Turkey, Dorfman found Syrians tormented by the twin plights of unemployment and hopelessness. She was especially drawn to adolescents who, when they should be absorbing new experiences, found themselves marooned in a netherworld of idleness and deprivation. “In the beginning they all thought they could go home and I think now, in the fifth year of the war, they realize that where they are is where they are going to stay...for a very long time,” she sighs.</p>
<p>Dorfman quickly knew that she wanted to do something that would focus on these teenagers. In retrospect, she draws a line from her very first book (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-C-Word-Teenagers-Families/dp/0966553403">1999’s</a> <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-C-Word-Teenagers-Families/dp/0966553403">The C-Word</a></em>), about teen cancer survivors, to the refugee work. Both seek to illuminate the experiences of young people facing dire circumstances. She ran the idea by her contacts at the U.N. and got an enthusiastic response. From that point she worked on it in conjunction with her other U.N. assignments, applying her techniques for creating environmental portraits, honed over a decade of magazine work, to her subjects. “As much as possible, I wanted them to look into the camera so that a connection could be made,” Dorfman says.</p>
<p>Along the way Dorfman began making audio recordings of her subjects. While she found the youths eager to tell their stories, there were some hurdles; males of military age feared retaliation from the regime, and young girls had limited autonomy. “They often had to ask permission of fathers or brothers before they could be photographed,” Dorfman says, “and in one case we had to really rush to get them on audiotape, because they had to do it before the men came back.”</p>
<p>The unrelenting heat and dust of the camps was a constant challenge. Dorfman traveled light, using her iPhone as a recording device and abandoning the portable strobes she had brought from her studio. “Normally my craft is very precise, controlled, and being in a situation like this was almost the opposite,” Dorfman says.</p>
<p>In 2014, Dorfman reached out to the Holocaust Museum about her ongoing work in the Middle East. They showed interest and, in July of the same year, she went to Washington, D.C. Almost as an afterthought, she told the curators about the teen photos and audio. Several months later, the curators told her that they were interested in exhibiting that work. “I worked closely with the museum which included meetings on location in D.C, conference calls and, of course, many emails. Over the course of several months we honed the look, feel, and pacing of the piece,” Dorfman says. Her hope for the work is simple: to create something that allows the audience to connect on a human level with these young people, who yearn to be something more than statistics.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[New York-based photographer <a href="http://megangreenphotographer.com/">Megan Green</a> explains how she broke into the testosterone-driven world of auto racing, and started landing jobs from bloggers, magazines, racing teams and commercial clients. 
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How did you get started covering motorsports?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Megan Green:</strong> I started in 2010 on a personal project. When I was a kid, my family always went to a track up near Albany called <a href="http://www.lebanonvalley.com/">Lebanon Valley Speedway</a>. My sister and I loved it. I remember sitting there with my mom’s Instamatic, watching these cars go by, and thinking, I’m going to take a picture and it’s going to look just like those shots by professionals. I had in my head the picture I wanted to take. I went to art school, and was a fine art photographer for a while. In 2010 my family was going to the races, and I had my gear with me, and from that point on, I was hooked again. I love every minute, out there with these roaring engines.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Tell us more about why it appeals to you. </strong></p>
<p><strong>MG: </strong>The action is really exciting, and there’s a whole community around it. There’s action on the racetrack, but also in the paddock and in the pits. It’s fascinating watching the engineers and the mechanics. It’s camaraderie between people. Racing is about the race, but it’s also about the people.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What was the first job you got?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> I was in California with a team for <a href="http://www.autobytel.com/">Autobytel</a>, and we were covering the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance. That was the first time I shot a race professionally.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What’s the story behind your social media handle, <a href="https://twitter.com/ponycargirl">Ponycargirl</a>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG: </strong>When I first started shooting cars, I ripped a page from the PR book and thought, I need a name, I need to streamline a message, and define who I am in this industry. I love Ford Mustangs, and they’re called pony cars. So I took the name Pony Car Girl and started using it on social media.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How did you hone your skills at this type of photography?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> Trial and error, and a lot of practice. When I was working on it as a personal project, I would go home and look at everything, and go, I can’t believe I missed that shot, this is terrible. How do I make this better?” I went to YouTube and looked up videos on how to pan, and I read different photographers’ blogs about how they do things—settings, for example. I’d go back to read my camera manual, and see, ‘Oh, if I set it on image stabilization #2 I’ll get a better pan. So it was a combination of trial and error and looking everything up online to see what other photographers do. And asking other photographers questions.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Do you have photographers you consider mentors, whose images you learned the most from?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> I love <a href="https://twitter.com/marshallpruett?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Marshall Pruett’s photos</a>. He’s phenomenal. And then my friend <a href="http://www.thestar.com/authors.grant_gary.html">Gary Grant</a>, who is a motorsports photographer in Toronto, took me under his wing and taught me how to work a race.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What kinds of things did he teach you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG: </strong>He taught me the basics: Stand back here, don’t sit down, never have your back to the cars because they can crash in the blink of an eye, know the racetrack’s good angles. You want to be in certain places at a certain time of the day because the light is good.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Are there a lot of women in this niche? </strong></p>
<p><strong>MG: </strong>There aren’t many of us. You go to a race and see the photographers, and more often than not, they’re men. There are a lot of opportunities, but there aren’t a lot of women at the top levels.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Have you had trouble getting jobs because you’re a woman?</strong></p>
<p>MG: I haven’t felt that. On the one hand, because I’m a woman, I’m slightly more visible. Getting work is based on building relationships, and that can be more difficult because you’re a woman, because guys have friendships, and there’s camaraderie that might not be as accessible for a woman.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: So how do you compensate for that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG: </strong>I just try to be as visible as possible. I send out promos, I have an online presence, I do a lot of social media, I try to talk to people.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: You mean cold call them, or approach them at races?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG: </strong>You build relationships at races, shake hands with people. You don’t walk up to someone and say, “Hey, will you hire me?” but you have to open your mouth and build those relationships, so it’s easier the next time.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What are rates like for this niche?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> It’s generally a day rate, I would say $1,000 for a day.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: You mentioned that there’s a lot of opportunity for photographers. Like what?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> It’s not just publications. For every logo on a race car, there’s a company sponsoring that team, and running marketing programs off of that, so they need photos. And then the team itself needs photos. There aren’t as many magazines, but [everyone] needs photos for social media: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. So there’s still a need for photographers. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you reach those brands that sponsor drivers and teams?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> I’ve been finding out who the marketing director is, or the PR agency. I send promotional postcards. I’ll follow brands on Instagram, and I follow the teams. When I shoot events, I’ll post images of some of the competitors on Instagram, and I’ll tag them, and more often than not, they’ll either ‘like’ it or comment on the photo. So that helps drive visibility. I don’t know if it’s gotten me a gig yet, but it’s one tool for getting your name out there.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What’s in your gear bag? </strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> I’m a little unusual in that I shoot with Olympus equipment. I have an E-5 camera. I also have an OM-D E-M1. It’s good for shooting in the paddocks, but as far as action goes, it’s a bit of a challenge, and I’m probably going to look for another DSLR body, because mirrorless isn’t quite there yet for action. If you’re shooting in burst mode, and you’re following a car, unlike with a DSLR, you can’t see anything [through the viewfinder]. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Which lenses do you use?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> I have a 12–60mm f/2.8–4 lens, which is good for close-on action and shooting around the paddocks. And I have a 50-200mm f/2.8–3.5 for longer shots.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Any unusual gear in your kit that’s particular to motorsports?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG: </strong>I always have a monopod. Since you’re out on a track, and you have to carry everything with you, I tend to carry as little as possible. You’re out there all day in the elements, so you don’t want to be carrying around 50 pounds of gear.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Is this a young person’s niche because of the physical demands? What’s the age range of photographers?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> It ranges from people in their 20s to all the old guys, 55, 65. They’re the ones [who] shot racing when it was a roll of 36 exposures in the camera. So they’re good. They can nail those shots. They’re the ones you want to talk to and learn from.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Any other advice for photographers interested in getting into this niche?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG: </strong>Practice. Know your camera, know your equipment. Go to a nearby street and practice your panning on the cars going by. Outside of that, take care of yourself. Run or bike. Shooting motorsports is brutal, and you need stamina. The better condition you’re in, the better off you’ll be.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<strong>Client:</strong> <em><a href="http://nailitmag.com/">Nail It!</a></em>
<p><strong>Beauty Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.fearnobeauty.com/about-me/">Karie Frost</a></p>
<p>Still-life photographer <a href="http://www.christineblackburne.com/">Christine Blackburne</a> says art directors and beauty editors often come to her with great concepts, then ask her to figure out how to make them work photographically. “I love solving these technical challenges. It’s fun for me,” says Blackburne, whose clients include e.l.f. Cosmetics, Harper Collins, <em>Essence, People en Espanol</em>, Marriott and Hublot. “I think they come to me for how I shape light and how I incorporate color and light.”</p>
<p>Karie Frost, beauty editor at <em>Nail It!</em> magazine, has been a frequent client; she first received one of Blackburne’s first promos seven years ago, and held onto it until she was at a job where she could call on the photographer’s technical and art directing skills. For a story about silver and gold nail polish trends, Frost brought Blackburne an idea to photograph a model’s manicured hand against shiny, metallic backgrounds, such as silver Mylar and a tray of reflective gold Pachinko balls. She wanted to capture the texture of the backgrounds, but keep the focus on the gleaming fingernails. </p>
<p>Blackburne notes, “The challenge for this image was keeping it from getting too busy, with all the texture created by the Pachinko balls, and keeping the camera far enough away…so it would not be reflected in each one.” Having a hand model in the shot added a lighting challenge: She would need to make the model’s skin look good while also making the shiny elements of the shot stand out. When she lights jewelry, such as the bracelets on the hand model’s wrist, “It takes a lot more contrast to make them look nice,” she says. “But if there’s too much contrast in the hand, it can get creepy-looking fast.” </p>
<p>Blackburne typically shoots in her 1,000-square-foot studio, located in South Street Seaport, a neighborhood in lower Manhattan. Blackburne often uses the studio’s white walls and 15-foot high ceilings to bounce light around when she’s shooting tabletop compositions. Having her own studio with 24-hour access allows her to experiment whenever she wants. “I’ll come in the day before the shoot and play around with the objects to wrap my head around what we’re going to do on the shoot day,” she says. “I don’t want there to be any surprises on set with a client.”</p>
<p><strong>Logistics</strong></p>
<p>Blackburne decided to pour the Pachinko balls onto a sheet of gold Mylar she had spread in an old darkroom developer tray. She quickly discovered that the balls settled into a neat grid, and wouldn’t provide the texture Frost wanted. She decided to bury some magnets among the balls, so they would bunch together. “Also, I was placing the tray on sawhorses, so I put some strong magnets underneath the tray to keep some balls in place,” she says. She adds, “A lot of what I do is a little of the mad scientist.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.carmenhandmodels.com/_flash/Model%20Gallerys/Gallery%20Women/christina_ambers_gallery/index.html">Christina Ambers</a>, an experienced hand model, was cast for the job. “Having a good hand model can make or break a shoot, just as much as a fashion model can,” Blackburne says, adding, “What looks natural to the camera might not be in actuality.” Blackburne had Ambers pose so that the nails were visible at the top of the image. The background and the bracelets helped create a frame that focused the eye on the nail color. </p>
<p><strong>Lighting</strong></p>
<p>“I used an extra-small softbox to create the overall light that would be flattering on the hand and create highlights in the ball,” the photographer says. The Chimera softbox, which measures about a foot by a foot and a half, was placed over the hand and props, and moved just slightly to camera left. Blackburne also lined up white reflector cards around all sides of the tray to bounce light back onto the reflective balls. </p>
<p>To provide further fill on the hand, Blackburne set up a Profoto head with a reflector to the right of the tabletop, and pointed it toward the ceiling just above the hand, so light bounced down onto the model’s hand. She set the Profoto Acute 2400R power pack to low power. Blackburne also added another white card right where the model’s arm enters the frame for further reflection. The only problem for the model was that she couldn’t see how her hand looked: The card in front of her obscured her view.</p>
<p>For additional coverage in anticipation of some compositing in post, Blackburne also took another shot of the hand with even more fill. For this shot, she held a white card between the model’s arm where it entered the frame and the camera and angled it so that it caught the light from the softbox but didn’t obscure the camera lens. </p>
<p>She used a nearly identical lighting setup when she photographed Ambers’ hand on silver Mylar, but she wanted to make sure there was some contrast and areas of darkness in the folds and creases. She moved the Profoto further to camera left and used a large silver card to throw some fill into the crumpled Mylar. </p>
<p><strong>Camera</strong></p>
<p>Blackburne’s go-to camera is a Fuji GX680. “It’s such a great camera for still life,” she says. “It pretty much has the front movements of a 4x5, but you can look through the lens.” She uses a Phase One IQ digital back and shoots tethered to her computer. She shot each of the still lifes with her camera on a Foba stand, roughly three feet away from the model’s hand. </p>
<p>She chose a 125mm Fujinon f/5.6 lens, and shot at f/22 at ISO 100. “I made sure I used a long enough lens to be able to get up high enough and not be dealing with camera reflection,” she notes.</p>
<p><strong>Postproduction</strong></p>
<p>If a job requires more than simple color correction or clean up, Blackburne prefers to handle the retouching and compositing herself. She draws the line, however, at retouching skin, which requires delicacy. “With hands especially, the meat of the palm has to be softened or it can become a focus. It’s also about making sure the hand lines are softened so they aren’t too prominent but the hand still has texture,” she says. “There is a fine line between over-retouched, and not retouched enough.”</p>
<p>Blackburne has been collaborating with retoucher <a href="http://t-retouching.com/">Tzveta Stamatova</a> for about two years. She’ll often give Stamatova a mock up of a composite as a guide but, says Blackburne, “after working together for two years, she knows what I like.” She prefers to hand over processed TIFFs rather than RAW files. On the shot of the pachinko balls, in addition to retouching the hand, Blackburne recalls, “We took down a little bit of the saturation and contrast in the background, to make sure the nails stood out more.” The shot of reflective Mylar required more extensive retouching, she notes. “It reflected everything in the room.” When each composite was done, Blackburne got a flattened TIFF she delivered to the client. When the completed images were published as full pages in <em>Nail It!</em>, says Blackburne, “I really liked how they came out.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.maggiesteber.com/main.html">Maggie Steber</a>, acclaimed documentary photographer, workshop instructor, and mentor, talks about the state of the industry for women and minorities, while offering career advice for all aspiring photographers. 
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Do you see things getting easier for women in the photography industry?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maggie Steber:</strong> I think so, just by the sheer number of women who are going into photography. I see institutions where it’s still heavily male, and heavily Anglo male. </p>
<p>But there are more women picture editors, who hire women—and not just women, but good photographers. I think women have made huge headway and now we have to make sure minorities are making more headway. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Who are the women picture editors you are thinking of?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MS:</strong> Michele McNally (<em>The New York Times</em>), Kira Pollack (<em>TIME</em>), Kathy Ryan (<em>The New York Times Magazine</em>), MaryAnne Golon (<em>The Washington Post</em>), Sarah Leen (<em>National Geographic</em>), Judy Walgren (<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>). It’s tricky to name names because we could leave somebody out, and that would not be nice.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: There are professions that have been dominated by men, but then become dominated by women as [wages drop in] those professions. Has that happened in photography?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MS: </strong>It’s too early to say. What I would say is that women are freer in this country and other countries to be a wife and be a mother and still be a photographer. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Do women still have to work harder than men to make it in photography?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MS:</strong> I think at this point, everybody has to work really, really hard to be a photographer. It’s just so much harder than it was. What a lot of people don’t understand, men or women, is [that] you just have to be a never-say-die person. If somebody hurts your feelings, have a good cry and get over it. It is a hard, frustrating business, and it takes a lot of thinking, and planning, and it’s exhausting, and never ending, but man, when it works, it is very gratifying. The thing that’s lacking is having grace about it, and wanting it so badly, you don’t give up.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What do you mean by having grace about it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MS: </strong>After you get kicked in the teeth a few times, you can become very bitter. And I’ve met photographers who’ve received accolades and attention, and as a result have great egos. If you’re one of those people who has had a lot of success, you need to help other photographers. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Is there more flexibility for women to have a career and a family now than when you were coming up?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MS: </strong>First of all, no one ever asks men this question and I think they should ask because men have a lot to say about it. Secondly, asking anyone at all about this very personal choice of having a family or not gets us into territory that is hugely sensitive.</p>
<p>Some women photographers have a family and a partner and they are testament that it can be done. Some women photographers want to have children and for one reason or another that has nothing to do with desire, they cannot. For people who want to have children and cannot, this is a very hard question. For someone like me, I don’t mind stating publicly that I didn’t particularly want to have children. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Do you see young women photographers struggle with whether or not they can have children and a career, and what do you tell them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MS:</strong> Deciding to have a family or not really has nothing to do with photography. People have, for centuries, overcome great odds to do with their lives what they will and they will continue to do so. It’s important for younger women to go into this personal decision and photography with their eyes wide open but also realize that you don’t necessarily have to choose one way of life over another.</p>
<p>I think [having children] does change the way people look at you, and it can [lead] some photo editors to regard you differently. On the other hand, with some photo editors, especially women who have children, they’ll think it’s wonderful and do everything they can to support you because you have children. So it can work both ways. </p>
<p>What we women must not do is vilify one another for our choices. Have kids, don’t have them, be sensitive to those who want them, but we must respect one another’s choices and decisions.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Do you think female photographer have any inherent advantages over male photographers?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MS: </strong>A mistake that a lot of young photographers make—men and women—is that they get this big idea, and they don’t know how to focus it. Based on my experience, women see the smaller things. That’s why I think they are really well-suited to [photography]: They have this ability to [focus on those smaller things]. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Do you think they have advantages of access?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MS:</strong> A lot of people don’t take women photographers seriously. That can work in their favor. I’ve worked around male photographers who could have cared less if I was there, because I was nobody. It was liberating. I wasn’t having to compete with these big tough guys who were busy competing with each other. [Also], you’re not threatening, and you can [more easily] go into people’s homes because there’s a lot of things we have in common [with female subjects all over the world]. It’s like, “Oh, she’s like us,” and I think that makes it much easier. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What about minorities who want to work in the photo industry?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MS:</strong> This [lack of minority voices in photography] is the last mountain we have to climb. We have to all be engaged in that.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Are there institutional barriers to minority photographers?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MS:</strong> There could be. And that’s why there has to be an ongoing conversation. But people have to understand something: You have to be a good photographer. That’s true for anybody no matter what color you are, no matter where you’re from. That said, there are some institutions that are trying to help move [photographers of color] forward. World Press Photo teaches a lot of workshops in Africa, and that’s partly to identify talent. The Open Society Institute is looking for those voices as well. I think there are more and more institutions [cultivating photographers around the world], but it’s a matter of finding them. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: But isn’t the deck still stacked heavily against photographers of color?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MS: </strong>That kind of comes down to personality, but yeah, it’s hard to be black in this country, and there’s a lot of benign racism. I’m mentoring a curator who’s black. She’s working in a museum world where nobody else looks like her. And she calls me some days crying. It’s not that anybody means to be mean to her, but it’s just really hard for minorities.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What do you tell her?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MS: </strong>I always say: You keep your head up high, and remember you’re walking on the shoulders of many people. Be proud of your heritage, and think about how you’ve succeeded to get this far, and how you will continue to go further. I’ve told her to find mentors. And I’ve told her: You could be the smartest person in the room, but you’re going to have to work twice as hard because there’s just a lot of people who don’t expect much of you, or don’t realize things about you. You have to find the person who believes you. It’s amazing what one person can do. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Do you have any other parting advice for young photographers about their careers and their work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MS: </strong>I’ve been on my high horse about this: I meet all these young photographers who don’t know a thing about the editorial world. They don’t look at magazines. So they don’t know how to target their work. Go to Barnes &amp; Noble and spend two or three hours looking at all kinds of magazines. Get to know your editorial market.</p>
<p>And how about this? Learn the history of photography, for heaven’s sake! Not only has learning the history of photography influenced my work, but what a wonderful, delicious, extravagant extraordinary knowledge to have. [And] picture editors are excited to meet someone who can speak about photography in an intelligent way, and who, by the way, has looked at their magazine. </p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.laurendukoff.com/">Lauren Dukoff’s</a> most widely seen celebrity portraits are intimate and often quiet, capturing something unexpected behind the public personae of musicians and actors. On shoots for <em>Vanity Fair, L’Uomo Vogue, SOMA, Lula</em> and <em>Elle</em>, often working with wardrobe stylists to meet the magazines’ need to show celebrities in certain clothes, Dukoff has to put her subjects at ease quickly and capture “what they’re opening up and giving me.” Her approach to portraiture is rooted in her background shooting documentary-style images of musicians offstage, “trying to find those stolen moments.” She adds, “I’m always trying to give fans a respectful peek into these peoples’ lives, and to get something special that viewers wouldn’t ordinarily see.”
<p>In the past two years, Dukoff has also shot fashion stories for <em>Vogue </em>Japan. On these assignments, she is not eliciting emotion from her subjects, but guiding the models to portray a character. “For me, a fashion story is really about the clothes and the designer, and the fantasy you’re creating,” she explains. “The emotion, the attitude is something I create.”</p>
<p>Photographing celebrities in selected fashions and creating fashion stories from scratch require different skills and planning. Creating fashion stories “wasn’t natural at first,” Dukoff says, “but I think that the transition of shooting so much fashion on celebrities [in my portrait work], under my direction, helped me get comfortable with that.” </p>
<p>Mayumi Nakamura, the editor at <em>Vogue </em>Japan who gave Dukoff her first fashion assignment, believes the photographer’s ability to create a distinctive image within the constraints of a celebrity shoot—limited time, the needs of fashion editors and hovering publicists—serves her well when directing complex fashion shoots. “Lauren has got a skill to get over these limitations and manage to make her own statements in these photos.” </p>
<p>When she started out, Dukoff wasn’t interested in creating stories on “a blank canvas”: “I wanted someone to feed off of,” she says. She benefitted from long collaborations with some subjects. Her photos of musician Devendra Banhart, a friend since high school, and his friends and collaborators were collected in <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1F6NTn9">The Family</a></em><a href="http://amzn.to/1F6NTn9">, published in 2009</a>. Dukoff spent weeks observing and photographing singer Adele during the making of her breakthrough 2011 album<em> 21</em>, shooting the cover and all the publicity for the album. </p>
<p>Work like this lead to assignments shooting similar, documentary-style images for <em>Rolling Stone</em> and advertisers like Nike. More often, however, clients have hired her to shoot portraits that require her to gain the trust of her subjects and establish a rapport quickly. To keep the focus on “me and the subject, and that one moment between us,” she likes to have a stripped-down set and work with a small but trusted crew. She notes that celebrities “feel more comfortable with fewer eyes on them.” She spends a few minutes talking to her subjects before the shoot begins to decide how much or how little direction she needs to give in order to elicit something. “It could be that whatever they’re giving me a lot of, I want to get the opposite,” she says. “Or there’s a lot that I’ve seen in other photos of someone and I want to get something different.”</p>
<p>As an example, Dukoff describes a sitting with actor Adam Driver in New York City. “He’s got a lot of energy, which I love,” she says. She first had him jump around the studio. Then she recalls, “I noticed him pulling at his shirt, and I said, ‘Why don’t you do more of that?’” Driver continued, and ended up with his arms stuck in his sleeves, at which point Dukoff captured him looking serious and vulnerable. “That felt very intimate,” she says. “For him, and his energy, that seemed like a special moment.” </p>
<p>She began shooting portraits with fashion elements in 2009, when she met a writer for <em>L’Uomo Vogue</em> who encouraged her to pitch stories. She pitched one on Banhart, and that led to assignments shooting “a slew of musicians,” actors, directors, “all different kinds of people.” An editor would suggest wardrobe for these shoots. Says Dukoff, “There was an emphasis on shooting the right kinds of clothing, but I was still approaching it as a portrait.” </p>
<p>An assignment for Lula called for her to shoot actress Gia Coppola in a long, sheer gown designed by Rodarte. “I realized how beautiful it would be to see that gown backlit,” Dukoff recalls. She had the actress pose on a ladder so the sun shone through the dress. “I wanted to focus on her, and not just the gown, so they influenced and complemented one another.” </p>
<p>In 2013 she landed an assignment for <em>Vogue </em>Japan to photograph Princess Charlene of Monaco in clothes provided by Akris on location at the royal residence once occupied by Grace Kelly. Says Dukoff, “I remember thinking to myself, ‘Oh my god: <em>Vogue</em> is flying me across the globe to photograph a princess. When did that happen?’” One of Dukoff’s images was used on the cover. </p>
<p><em>Vogue </em>Japan’s Nakamura also hired Dukoff to photograph Olympic swimmer Aya Terakawa in clothes by Tory Burch. Terakawa had typically been photographed smiling broadly. Says Dukoff, “I wanted to show something more iconic and goddess-like.” She photographed Terakawa from behind her chin up, wearing a dress with a low back so the tan lines left by her bathing suit were visible. </p>
<p>Nakamura says she was impressed by “the quiet sense of class” Dukoff had captured. “I wanted her to shoot a fashion story featuring dresses with more formal and elegant touches.” For the fall 2013 issue of <em>Vogue Wedding Japan</em>, where Nakamura serves as creative director, she assigned Dukoff to shoot a fashion story featuring clothes by Prada, MiuMiu, Bottega Veneta, Reem Acra and other designers. </p>
<p>Just as Dukoff had been inspired by her portrait subjects, she began taking inspiration from the hand-crafted creations of couturiers. “So much time and work goes into these gowns, I really want to do them justice,” she says. For a recent <em>Vogue </em>Japan shoot, which took place in a garden, she scouted locations and planned the lighting and composition of hser images with the fabric and design of each outfit in mind. </p>
<p>In shooting fashion, Dukoff says, “I’m collaborating indirectly with the designer.” Working with veteran stylist and longtime friend <a href="http://www.jedroot.com/stylists/ashley-furnival">Ashley Furnival</a>, she pores over images from runway shows in New York and Paris, “to see where the designers are coming from and how they present their collections.” Then they build stories around common themes. </p>
<p>“I never had this dream of shooting fashion, but there’s something really powerful about it,” Dukoff says. “Everyone gasps when the model walks out in the perfect gown with the perfect hair and makeup. There are so many elements that have to come together, there’s a kind of magic about it when it all works.” </p>
<p>Whether she’s photographing a famous face or a model, Dukoff says, “At the end of the day I’m just trying to make something that’s interesting to myself and the viewer. That’s the goal for all my shoots: To make something that will truly last.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Intuition and adaptability help <a href="http://www.annawolf.com/">Anna Wolf</a> create fashion photographs and portraits defined by their accessibility and honesty. “I really connect with the people I’m photographing, and that comes through in the images,” she says. Whether she’s working with models for clients like Naturalizer, New Balance or Steven Alan, or depicting a portrait subject for a Microsoft campaign or for <em>T: The New York Times Style Magazine</em>, Wolf tries to bring a lifestyle esthetic to all her images. Engaging with her talent is key, she says.
<p>“There are a couple big pieces of the puzzle that go into making a good photograph,” the Brooklyn-based photographer explains. Behind-the-scenes elements like lighting and styling, and her relationship with her client are one piece, “and then there’s my relationship with my talent.”</p>
<p>“Everyone comes to set with their own energy, and I’m pretty good at reading people” and giving them what they need, Wolf says. “I usually go into shoots really positive and happy. I think it’s a good place to start, and then you see from there.”</p>
<p>Annie Martineau, an associate creative director for women’s footwear brand <a href="http://www.naturalizer.com/?CMP=KNC-Adwords&amp;partnerid=Adwords&amp;cpc=Adwords&amp;campaign=Brand+-+Core+-+Exact&amp;group=Core+Brand+-+General&amp;cpckw=naturalizer&amp;k_clickid=52a41226-e2fa-62a8-8b92-00002117e88a&amp;cvosrc=ppc.google.naturalizer&amp;matchtype=e&amp;gclid=CJa5sILZzscCFcESHwodmE8AVA">Naturalizer</a>, has worked with Wolf since 2013. She says Wolf’s energy and collaborative spirit help her establish a rapport with creatives and talent. “With her, it was just so easy to collaborate, it was fun,” Martineau says. “It makes for better quality work in the end when everyone is having a good time and we can focus on the work and not on drama.”</p>
<p>Wolf says she developed both her fashion and portrait work simultaneously as she was growing her career. Initially she was drawn to high fashion for the creative freedom she thought it would afford her. But once she realized that fashion work demanded heavy involvement in the fashion world, she opted for a more lifestyle approach, shooting ready-to-wear brands rather than couture. “I love high fashion, but I like my work to reflect my life,” she says. “Shooting high fashion is a whole other world and you’ve got to have very thick skin. I’m more interested in living life, and having my photos reflect that.”</p>
<p>Her accessible fashion esthetic has led to portraiture work as well. “When I’m hired to do celebrity [portraiture] it’s because of my lifestyle and fashion work.” <a href="http://bust.com/hot-off-the-presses-our-octnov-issue-with-neko-case.html">A cover story about the musician Neko Case for</a> <em><a href="http://bust.com/hot-off-the-presses-our-octnov-issue-with-neko-case.html">BUST</a></em> <a href="http://bust.com/hot-off-the-presses-our-octnov-issue-with-neko-case.html">magazine</a>, for instance, showed Case at home on her farm, interacting with one of her horses.</p>
<p>Working with celebrity subjects can be a very different proposition than working with models, Wolf says, because they—and their publicists—often have a say in the creative process. “One of the things I notice a lot is that you look at someone’s fashion work and it’s really strong, and then you look at their celebrity [portraiture] and it doesn’t have the same feeling,” she explains. “There’s a lot of cooks in the kitchen” on celebrity portraiture shoots.</p>
<p>Wolf says she’s been making a concerted effort to get all of her images to make sense together esthetically, so she’s been more selective about the portrait work she takes on. She’ll research a subject to try and figure out if they will mesh creatively. “When a job comes in and I don’t feel like the talent is right or the styling is going to be right” she’ll pass, she says. “If I’m inspired, ultimately that’s what’s best for the client, too.”</p>
<p>To create a unified vision throughout her portfolio, Wolf strives to create portraits that have fashion and lifestyle elements, she says. “I am trying to get away from portraits of people just sitting there in front of the camera,” she says. “It’s so much more interesting to me when people are doing things in the picture and when they’re engaged with their environment or with me.” </p>
<p>She also founded a fashion and lifestyle magazine, <em><a href="http://www.tidal-mag.com/">Tidal</a></em>, last year, in part because she wanted to create more fashion work. “Pitching fashion stories has always been a roller coaster; doing the magazine has allowed me to do whatever I want.” Her fashion work for the magazine has become a portfolio that leads to portrait and lifestyle work for clients. “The magazine helps me to get work in a few different ways. It enables me to shoot the things I’m super into at the moment, which is ultimately the thing that is most inspiring to clients. It’s also just a great connector and becomes another way to really get my name and work in front to people.” Wolf was just releasing the third issue of <em>Tidal</em> as we went to press, and says she’ll often send the magazine to clients with a thank-you note after a shoot.</p>
<p>Between her commissioned work and producing the magazine, Wolf says she shoots “a lot.” She continues shooting portrait assignments for the opportunity to meet and collaborate with interesting, inspiring subjects. Some people, of course, are uncomfortable in front of the camera, she says. “Other times it’s really fun because [the subject has] this whole other world of experience and other places they’re coming from, and they bring that personality to the images, which can be really different than models who have their moves down.”</p>
<p>Some models offer a similar creativity, and are so good at what they do that they require little direction, Wolf explains. “Then sometimes you have a model who has their lookbook moves, and you have to put a ton of energy into getting what you want out of them.”</p>
<p>“That’s the exciting-slash-awful part of photography,” Wolf adds. “Every time you roll [into a shoot] you don’t know what you’re going to get.”</p>
<p>When she first hired Wolf for Naturalizer, Martineau was looking to establish a long-term relationship with a photographer who could help define the visual identity of the brand. As they’ve continued their collaboration, “the work just keeps getting better,” Martineau says. </p>
<p>For a recent Naturalizer campaign, Wolf tackled the challenge of working with mothers and daughters who had no previous modeling experience. Martineau says the shoot marked “that next phase of how we develop our professional rapport.” Wolf was attentive to the women’s comfort levels, and engaged them by doing things like offering to play their music in the studio, Martineau recalls. “I don’t think every photographer can [work with non-models],” she says. “Some other photographers can get impatient or force some things, but Anna’s approach is just very organic. She lets people get into their element or their zone and waits for it. It doesn’t really matter if we’re going over on time; the important part is, is everyone comfortable, and can we get the best work out of them?”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Color grading—much like editing in general—plays a dual role in any video production. It’s called on to ensure a consistent look across multiple file sources, and it’s also a source of creative expression. 
<p>“When used effectively, clients shouldn’t notice editing, sound or color,” says <a href="http://onyxmediagroup.com/">Onyx Media</a> cinematographer Georgia Yeh. “When the color becomes ‘invisible’ to the client, we’ve created an experience for them that is emotionally engaging. The goal is to use color grading so effectively that the client does not see it, but rather feels it and becomes engrossed in the story being told without realizing how much color has played a part in how they feel. However, the moment there is a visual inconsistency, our minds will pick it up immediately and it becomes a disruption.”</p>
<p>You can also leverage color to visually enhance or stylize your entire film, imbuing it with anything from the deep blues and grays of a gritty Hollywood crime drama to the film stock of 1970s Kodachrome. “Color grading to me is a visual cue for the audience that often connects on a subliminal level,” explains Linda Ung, head of production at <a href="http://www.filthylookfilms.com">Filthy Look Films</a>. “It may tell the audience at what point of the day it is, or if someone is having a flashback. It can set the tone of a scene without using words.” Jill Bogdanowicz, senior colorist at <a href="http://www.efilm.com">EFILM</a> agrees: “Color grading helps tell the story of the movie. It helps integrate different sets, weather changes. It helps create a mood.”</p>
<p>Dealing with color can be overwhelming for filmmakers who aren’t used to the process. But overcoming these challenges simply requires making informed choices while filming and committing some additional attention to adjustments during postprocessing. “One of the essential lessons in filmmaking, especially when you’re in charge of both shooting and editing, is to make careful decisions from the beginning,” says <a href="http://www.elettrafiumi.com/">Elettra Fiumi</a>, a multimedia journalist and CEO/Co-founder of <a href="http://grannycartproductions.com/">Granny Cart Productions</a>. “All steps, from selecting the shoot location and considering what light will be available, to what camera settings you have when you shoot, will help your color correcting process later on and help you produce an overall better-quality film.” </p>
<p>When filming with color correction in mind, your goal should be to get the lowest compression and highest quality file possible. Color correction and grading can be particularly unkind to low-quality, highly compressed footage. If RAW or ProRes codecs are available on your camera, you should use them. If not, record at the flattest, most neutral color setting your camera offers. Once you have filmed your footage and everything is imported into your editor, the actual color work begins. Just what you’ll need to do will vary based on your software, but there are some general principles that apply no matter what tool you choose. </p>
<p>During the grading process, many editors like to start with the blacks first, then the whites, before moving to mid tones and skin tones. Many editors prefer to work in this order because changes to both blacks and whites tend to affect the entire scene, while changes to mid tones and skin tones don’t have such a universal impact on the surrounding colors. </p>
<p>“The first thing I do is throw on [Red Giant] Colorista, and reach for the eye dropper for auto-white balance. I like to make sure my whites are white. Then I make sure skin colors look good and I’ll tweak accordingly with Colorista’s color wheels in the Primary 3-way panel,” Ung says. “If the shot is looking a little green, I’ll use the center ball of the color wheel and move it to the opposite direction to the green color. Taking the ball in the other direction of the color wheel will help neutralize the color cast,” she says.</p>
<p>Another rule: Trust the waveform, vectorscope and parade scope information in your editing program of choice. These visual guides provide luminance, chrominance and RGB values, respectively, for your video. Similar (but not identical) to the role that a histogram plays for still image editing, these visual data points will ensure that you are editing colors consistently frame-to-frame.</p>
<p>Correcting for multiple light sources in a scene can also be a challenge when grading. This is particularly true when shooting in a run-and-gun style where not every aspect of the environment can be controlled, such as an interior scene lit by incandescent lights with a bank of sunlit windows. Programs such as <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve">DaVinci Resolve</a>, with its Power Windows masking feature, offer a powerful way to approach these issues. EFILM’s Bogdanowicz explains, “I’ll select Power Windows from the Resolve control panel and then I select whether I want to isolate the section with a pre-made shape or draw around something freehand, which I do with a mouse. I then use the panel to tell the shape to track to the shot and Resolve maintains that selected area, despite the movement of the actor or the camera.”</p>
<p>Once initial corrections are finished, editors typically apply any overall grading for style or emotion. Your choices here are almost unlimited. Software like <a href="https://www.redgiant.com/products/magic-bullet-looks/">Red Giant’s Looks</a> offer you scores of preset styles and emulations. Looking for more options? There are thousands of Look Up Tables (LUTs) available. LUTs are mathematical formulas designed to take footage and grade it to a specific look. </p>
<p>While amazingly powerful, LUTs don’t take into consideration what settings and equipment were used during capture. That’s why filmmakers like Ony Media’s Yeh use plug-ins like <a href="http://filmconvert.com/">FilmConvert</a>, which is essentially a dynamic LUT that is programmed to adjust for input and output values. “Once finished with basic adjustments in Colorista, I finalize the look by applying FilmConvert and its wide array of camera profile LUTs.” Yeh notes that it also simplifies a step that’s essential for any film shot with more than a single camera. As Yeh notes, “FilmConvert LUTs allow me to achieve the same esthetic across all cameras and I love using it to unify the look in a simple step instead of spending many hours in color correction.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Landing fashion assignments requires both a distinctive style and an understanding of what fashion clients want. Photographers who have successfully built a clientele among fashion brands say that building a portfolio of distinctive, polished work was essential. It also helped that they had forged collaborative relationships with stylists and others who could help them create professional imagery and get the attention of clients. 
<p>Full interviews with each of the photographers cited here, as well as more information on assignments that can help launch aspiring fashion photographers’ careers, are available to <em>PDN</em> subscribers via PDNOnline.com (<a href="https://emeraldexpo.omeda.com/cgi-win/npdn.cgi?mode=gmpage&amp;p=712DIGED">login required</a>). </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/personal-work-jarvis">Personal Work that Lands Assignments: Shaniqwa Jarvis</a></strong></p>
<p>When an agent told <a href="http://www.shaniqwajarvis.com/">Shaniqwa Jarvis</a> to photograph the people around her, she thought the idea was “hackneyed,” but she did pursue a project that was personal to her: Photographing intriguing looking men in their homes. Jarvis, who had moved to London from Los Angeles after a bad breakup, recalls, “I was working out my issues with dudes.” After she turned <a href="http://www.shaniqwajarvis.com/exhibitons/this-charming-man">“This Charming Man”</a> into an exhibition and published a catalogue, assignments began coming in from retail and fashion brands that wanted Jarvis to photograph 20- and 30-something guys in the signature style of her personal project. She has since reached out to other brands, and has shot for Liberty, Nike and Converse. </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/career-path-jenks">Breaking Into Fashion Photography: Meredith Jenks’s Career Path</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.meredithjenks.com/">Meredith Jenks</a> says that assisting photographers in Los Angeles gradually led to shooting portrait and commercial assignments, but to pursue a career shooting fashion, she moved to New York City. Two of the most important steps in building her career: Meeting fellow professionals—including photographers—and shooting constantly, both for herself and for modeling agencies and designers in need of look books. “Doing the tests, I would meet people who worked in the fashion industry,” she says. After an influential fashion blogger she’d met asked Jenks to shoot for her site, Jenks recalls, “People in the fashion industry started noticing me because my photographs were on her blog.”</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/career-path-nipar">Breaking into Fashion Photography: Brooke Nipar’s Career Path</a></strong></p>
<p>“You constantly have to be committed to personal work, because it’s part of the process,” says <a href="http://brookenipar.com/">Brooke Nipar</a>. Shooting tests and then pitching her ideas to magazines helped her get known. The personal work, she says, was always done professionally: “With a stylist and with hair and makeup, making it what I felt a magazine would be interested in taking.” Being proactive about meeting people in fashion—by attending events during Fashion Week, for example—and maintaining relationships with her current clients have also been key. “Sometimes I’ll feel myself slipping on that,” she says, “and I’ll say: You need to go on meetings and remind people that you’re around.”</p>
<p><strong><a href="/exports/galleries/From-Assistant-to-Ph-10952.shtml">From Assistant to Photographer: Jamie Magnifico</a><br />
</strong><br />
To learn as much about technique and lighting as he could after he moved from Vermont to New York City, Jamie Magnifico worked at a rental studio and as a freelance production assistant. He explains how he turned these jobs, and his work as an assistant to several photographers, into tutorials on lighting, estimating and running productions. An attention to customer service helped him build relationships, which he says was the key to his success, as fellow photographers made introductions to modeling agencies and to other professionals who could critique his work and help him improve. The criticism was often blunt and hard to take, he says. “I’d rather people tell me, ‘That looks like shit.’ Then I can say, ‘Tell me why. If this is shit, how do I make it better?’” Within three years, he started landing assignments to shoot celebrities for Essence magazine, and fashion campaigns for designer Brett Johnson. <br />

<br />
Photographer Wynn Myers took a long and winding road to her career, enrolling in three different photography programs over the course of a decade, trying her hand at fine art before turning to commercial work, and learning the business by assisting a photo editor and consultant, rather than assisting photographers.  Based in Austin, Texas, she has chosen to focus on shooting lifestyle fashion. Consultant Jasmine Defoore helped her learn about promotion and marketing, while advice from photo editor and creative strategist Melissa McGill helped her fill holes in her portfolio. Another key break came when she met rep Simone Friend, of Friend + Johnson, who helped her bid on a job. <br />

<br />
Working with fashion retailers such as Bloomingdales and Lord &amp; Taylor, the agency Totem Creative has carved out a niche producing catalogues and marketing materials that feel like editorial products—more magazine than mail-order. Hessler and Robert Festino, two creative directors working closely together on the Lord &amp; Taylor account, explain where they look for photographers, how they hire them, and how they produce a book that’s neither editorial nor advertising, but a little bit of both. </p>

Agent <a href="http://www.triciajoyce.com/">Tricia Joyce</a>, who represents photographers and stylists, says that shooting look books—the image portfolios that show off a designer’s collection—can provide a “tremendous opportunity to learn about that process, to understand what designers need and how best to translate that into a beautifully composed ad for them, and a look book to me is the stepping stone to that” future commercial work. Photographer Jody Rogac notes that collaborating with smaller, upstart designers was helpful. “If you have a good relationship, it’s great to grow together,” Rogac says. </p>

<p>Magdalena Wosinska began landing clients like <em>Dazed &amp; Confused</em>, Lee Jeans and Converse after she self-published a limited-edition book of her personal work.

People have to keep seeing new work, because there’s so much competition,” she says. </p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[In her 40-year career, pioneering photojournalist <a href="http://www.maryellenmark.com/">Mary Ellen Mark</a> made numerous portraits of celebrities, artists, film directors and the ordinary people whose lives she documented intimately. In the months before her death on May 25, she continued her teaching and worked on two books, which will be published this fall by Aperture. In <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1EnFjFv">Mary Ellen Mark on the Portrait and the Moment</a></em>, she distilled some of the advice that she shared with her students over the years about working with portrait subjects. <a href="http://aperture.org/shop/mary-ellen-mark-on-the-portrait-and-the-moment">Part of Aperture’s Photography Workshop Series,</a> <em><a href="http://aperture.org/shop/mary-ellen-mark-on-the-portrait-and-the-moment">Mary Ellen Mark on the Portrait and the Moment</a> </em>features 70 of Mark’s portraits and a lot of inspiration. 
<p><strong>“Let things happen”</strong></p>
<p>When I teach, I often arrange for my students to make portraits of people. I once sent a student to photograph a woman executive who is quite a put-together person. I warned the student, “She’s a formal person. Make a formal portrait of her—a beautiful, but formal, portrait.” No one, not the most experienced portrait photographer, would be able to take a great candid picture of her. (Also, a candid portrait takes a lot more time.) It’s not a good idea to try to ask people to behave in ways that don’t seem natural for them. Work with what you have, with who your subject is, and make decisions based on that. Consider the background, what looks right. Each person is different, and the background is an individual thing, as are decisions about whether to move closer or pull back, seated or standing, formal or casual. The picture’s about the person. It’s not about you. You have to think about what’s best for them, even though you’re still shooting it from your perspective.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try to get what you need. I might suggest what the subject should wear, but I wouldn’t ask them to leap in the air or lie down in the grass because of a preconceived idea that I had. I dislike those kinds of contrived pictures. I’m not trying to impose my own ideas as much as I am trying to figure out how to work with what’s there.</p>
<p>If I’m going to a location, I often try to get there a day ahead and think about how I want to shoot it. You should have an idea of what you want before the person steps into the picture. You can always seat the subject in nice light in a corner and see what happens. I much prefer working on location to working in the studio. I like to have a sense of a person’s belongings, a context to place them in, and also a sense of space and depth.</p>
<p>Sometimes portraits just happen, like when the Lone Ranger, Clayton Moore, came to his door dressed like this for a <em>Premiere</em> magazine story about old and famous cowboys. I didn’t expect him to be in costume. His house was modern, but he was still living the part of the Lone Ranger. He was difficult and paranoid. No matter what I did to put him at ease or how many times I said I was a big fan, he refused to remove the mask. So I went with it. I asked him to sit on the leather couch behind the Lone Ranger statue on the coffee table because it was just perfect.</p>
<p>I took this picture of Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy on an assignment. The magazine was very specific. They wanted a picture of [ventriloquist and actor] Edgar Bergen but not with the dummy, not with Charlie. I went to his house, and he was very polite and sweet. I started photographing him sitting down, but he was nervous and the picture wasn’t working. He was visibly uncomfortable, as a lot of people are when being photographed. Even for a performer like him, the camera is an object in your face. I’m very uncomfortable in front of a camera. This is always something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>His son, Chris, suggested, “Why don’t you have him get Charlie? Then he’ll relax.” So Chris went and got the suitcase and put it in the hallway. Edgar Bergen sat down right there, unpacking Charlie. I would never have thought to set this up. There’s something about letting people do what comes naturally. No matter how hard you try to set up or control a portrait, sometimes there’s nothing better than allowing spontaneity in the session. I happened to be in the hallway when this was happening. Luckily, I got just a couple of frames before the moment was over.</p>
<p>But it’s not that I thought, “I got it,” and stopped shooting. I took more pictures after that, but they just weren’t as good as this one. That’s not always the case, but this was the best picture in the end. It says it all.</p>
<p><strong>“Elevate the subject”</strong></p>
<p>What I’m always trying to do is to make a picture that goes beyond a story. I want every picture to be iconic (which is, of course, impossible). I want to elevate the subject beyond the moment and circumstance. I think in terms of individual images rather than the photo essay. For me, photography is about making one great image, one frame.</p>
<p>This image was shot on assignment for <em>Fortune</em> magazine for a story on urban and rural poverty. It’s very hard to photograph poverty—how do you photograph poverty in a way that hasn’t been done before? It’s easy to make a good picture of poverty but it’s truly challenging to make a great one. There are so many famous photographers and great images that have come before, like Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans. The subject matter comes with its own visual legacy. I suppose the same thing could be said of portraiture or any other genre. The point is, you can’t let the legacy paralyze you. You must be your own person and contribute to the legacy. Don’t worry about style and separating yourself from others shooting the same subject matter too much; the pictures will happen by shooting from your own personal point of view. Worry more about getting a great picture. </p>
<p>When I went into this house, I was struck by how the family used an old refrigerator as a closet to store things in. When I saw the boy lying there, I opened the refrigerator door. I wanted to include that detail in the picture. If the door had been closed, there would have just been a refrigerator next to a bed. But with it open, you still know it’s a refrigerator but you also see it’s a closet and know something more about how this family lives. You have to look for the details; be attuned to what strikes you, and use it to communicate. The closet-refrigerator still amazes me.</p>
<p><strong>On Connecting With Subjects</strong></p>
<p>A lot of people ask me how I create such a sense of intimacy in my photographs. That is an impossible question to answer. You are who you are. Sometimes I watch photographers act in a way that’s meant to draw out a subject and help them get pictures. They’re being friendly, asking questions, but it’s because they want pictures. There’s no real interest; it’s an act. I can see right through that and so can the subject.</p>
<p>I think you basically need to be shooting something or someone because they interest you; then, a relationship develops naturally. I don’t know if I’d call it intimacy—sometimes it is. It speaks to a particular kind of relationship between photographer and subject.</p>
<p><strong>On Editing</strong></p>
<p>If you want to be a photographer, it’s important to learn how to edit your work. It is one of the most difficult things to do. To be a great editor, you need to be ruthless about cutting pictures that almost work, pictures that are not quite good enough because the expression is off or the moment isn’t there. “Almost” and “not quite” are not good enough. You have to separate yourself from the subject and only consider the picture on its own merits. Would you put the picture in a frame on the wall? Will that picture live on its own?</p>
<p>It can be easier to learn to edit by working with other people’s photographs— you’re not attached to the subject in the same way and have no memory of the moment. You only think about the finished picture. Editing is really just a matter of learning how to recognize what works in the frame and what doesn’t— what you like in the frame and what you don’t like. The more you edit, the easier it comes to you.</p>
<p>I learned to be a good editor through teaching. I not only pick out the students’ best pictures, but have to be ready to discuss why I’ve selected them and what the students could do to improve as photographers.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Photography projects sometimes arise from blind faith in one’s instincts, even if that means years of wandering. Such was the case for <a href="http://www.tabithasoren.com/">Tabitha Soren</a>, who spent 12 years working on her project <a href="http://www.tabithasoren.com/fantasy-life">“Fantasy Life,”</a> about baseball as a metaphor for America’s identity myths. <a href="http://kopeikingallery.com/">Kopeikin Gallery</a> recently exhibited the project, which was also published in <em>California Sunday Magazine, Vanity Fair</em> and <em>ESPN The Magazine</em>. 
<p>The project centers around a group of minor league baseball players as they struggle to make it to the big leagues. “‘Fantasy Life’ is my attempt to portray the dreams of a nation—through baseball. This is what it looks like to try to touch greatness,” Soren writes in her artist’s statement about the project. She explores ideas such as manifest destiny; the notion that anyone can grow up to be President, or a major league ballplayer, if they work hard enough; fame and fortune as proxies for happiness; and failure as a key to success. </p>
<p>“I didn’t want it to be a documentary project,” she tells <em>PDN</em>, explaining that she worked on the project for five years before she had a clear idea where it was going. “Ideas pop when they pop. I knew I had a problem [defining what the project was about] and I just thought I’d figure it out as I went along. I just needed to stick with it and something would present itself.”</p>
<p>The project started when Soren attended spring training for the Oakland A’s in 2003, where she met the team’s draft class of about two dozen players. “It was a rare opportunity,” she says. “I thought, these guys have made it, they’re all so happy, they’ve quit college to be here. I would like to chronicle their transition into a commodity, into the major leagues, into what America deems a success story.”</p>
<p>Her initial plan was to shoot portraits of the players, to show how they changed over time. She envisioned portraits inspired by the paintings of Thomas Eakins, “where it would be a psychological exploration” of the aspiring ballplayers. But that idea didn’t pan out, because there wasn’t much change in their appearance from year to year. Besides, Soren says she realized she couldn’t do a project about baseball players and not show any action shots.</p>
<p>So she started shooting action. But because of where she was allowed to stand, her best action photographs ended up looking like images you’d see in <em>Sports Illustrated</em>. “It just didn’t look like my work,” she says. “I struggled to find my own voice.”</p>
<p>Another problem, Soren says, is that she had expected to fall in love with baseball as she got into the project. But she didn’t. She found herself wondering: Why are so many people obsessed with such a tedious game? And how do the players cope with a game that has so much built-in failure? </p>
<p>“There was something deeper I wanted to get at [about] the obsession of the [fans], and the enthusiasm and the sacrifice that the players made—I just needed to make sense of that as an artist. So it wasn’t that I felt like, well the project isn’t working,” she says. </p>
<p>She started doing research. And over time, the root of baseball’s appeal began to crystallize in Soren’s mind. “That drive and ambition that Americans are best in the world at, just made sense to me about why baseball is important to American culture.”</p>
<p>While she was doing her research, she read that the first baseball game was played within just a few years of the invention of tintypes. “So I thought, oh, maybe that’s what I can do, and I can make it my own, because most tintypes are portraits, not action shots, so let me try to figure out a way to make action shots in tintype.”</p>
<p>It was a formidable challenge. Tintypes require long exposure times, but sports action requires fast shutter speeds. Soren is tight-lipped about how she managed to shoot sports action with tintypes, other than to say it was an arduous process of trial and error, undertaken with “two devoted friends who helped and helped and helped…yes, a strobe was used, but so were many other things.”</p>
<p>Soren used an 8 x 10 view camera to shoot the tintypes, but throughout the project, she used cameras of all different formats—including a Canon EOS 5D, a Phase One, and a Hasselblad. “The mood and the intent of the picture determined the gear that I used,” she says.</p>
<p>The tintypes were just one facet of the project. Thinking of her project in terms of a metaphor for American cultural myths liberated Soren to follow her instincts in all kinds of ways. “I realized I didn’t have to just take pictures of my 21 [team-member subjects],” she explains. “I could take pictures of a door with all these foul-ball dents in it. It goes so many other directions where in the past I always felt, Oh, I need to focus, I need to get back to my project, and stop taking these sort of mystical, cinematic images.”</p>
<p>One example of that was an image she shot in 2013 of some post-game fireworks. “I spent a lot of time trying to shoot that in a modern, contemporary, non-sentimental sort of way: fireworks with pathos,” she says. </p>
<p>Another image hints at illusions of grandeur, with the floodlights of a minor league stadium peeking over the top edge of a dugout, and dust and bugs glowing in front of the lens like stars in the night sky. “I remember thinking, ‘Oh, I’ll just shoot this, indulge myself and then get back to the boredom of the dugout. But by the time I shot the fireworks picture, I felt totally convinced of my intention,” Soren says, adding, “I think any good artist keeps squeezing different things out of an idea, and eventually you hit on something that you feel is true.”</p>
<p>She used a Phase One camera to make a nighttime image of <a href="http://www.oraclearena.com/">O.co Coliseum</a> from a distance, aglow in floodlights. “You can see every car in the parking lot, in sharp focus. It needed to be that big [43 x 57 inches] to look as magical as Oz because the major league stadium is where these players want to be,” Soren says.</p>
<p>After the end of baseball season last year, she “dragged a number of people” to her studio find the best images from the thousands she had shot. Kopeikin Gallery, which represents Soren and showed her “Running” project in 2012, also mounted an exhibition of her “Fantasy Life” project from April 25–June 5. In addition to photographs, the exhibit included a wall of memorabilia, including X-rays and MRI scans of injured joints, provided by the players.</p>
<p>Several publications, including <em>California Sunday Magazine</em> and<em> ESPN the Magazine</em>, ran portfolios of Soren’s “Fantasy Life” photographs around the time of the show opening. She says she and other people who knew about the project pitched it to photo editors at those publications.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an L.A. sports-marketing acquaintance of Soren’s offered to help her publicize the project at no charge to sports media outlets. Soren says she found herself on ESPN SportsCenter “talking about manifest destiny and failure” while the network showed her tintypes. “It was funny to have sports anchors analyzing tintypes,” she says. And amusing, she says, that all the baseball players she’d befriended over the years saw her on TV—and began ribbing her on Twitter for pretending to know a thing or two about baseball.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[ “Ladies all across the world/Listen up, we’re looking for recruits,” sings <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kjpa0SMOug0">Brit girl-band Little Mix in their 2014 hit, “Salute.”</a> “If you’re with me, let me see your hands/Stand up and salute.” Women in the photography industry are singing a similar tune, it seems: Around the country, women’s photography collectives and salons are springing up. They range in size from intimate dinner parties to groups of a hundred or more, but all have the same core mission: to bring together women photographers for support and networking.
<p>“I feel women are really, really under-represented in photography: commercially, editorially and in the fine-art world,” says photographer <a href="http://maggie-meiners-yz2p.squarespace.com/">Maggie Meiners</a>, who, together with photo editor <a href="http://www.meghandlerphotography.com/Meg_Handler_Photography/Home.html">Meg Handler</a> and photographer <a href="http://sarahhadley.com/">Sarah Hadley</a>, founded Chicago Women in Photography (CWIP) in January of this year. “Gather women together and we have resources, we communicate really well, and I think all of [that] creates a strong foundation to break down barriers.” </p>
<p>With 116 members and counting, CWIP can certainly call its gathering a success. So can Santa Fe Women in Photography (SFWiP), which has amassed 125 members since it was founded in 2013 by <a href="http://www.cmccarthynow.com/">Carrie McCarthy</a>, Maggie Blanchard and <a href="http://www.melaniemcwhorter.com/">Melanie McWhorter</a>. Other, smaller groups are thriving too, like a group in Los Angeles with six members who each invite friends along, and a quarterly dinner party series for women photo professionals that New York-based photographer <a href="http://manjarisharma.com/">Manjari Sharma</a> started a year ago. </p>
<p>In a way, this could be seen as counter-intuitive: At a time when the professional photography pie is shrinking, women who might be competitors are coming together to support each other. But the women in these groups say that now, more than ever, is the time for female solidarity. “The pie is definitely getting smaller—the slices are thinner and thinner,” says <a href="http://www.lexeyswall.com/#!/index">Lexey Swall</a>, who coordinates meetings for <a href="http://www.womenphotojournalists.org/#!/index">Women Photojournalists of Washington</a> (WPOW). “But I feel like now is when we should be helping each other figure out creative ways of making this life work.” </p>
<p>The women in these groups are quick to say that they don’t want to alienate men, or make sweeping generalizations about male and female styles. Many add, however, that in an industry that has traditionally been male-dominated, it’s nice to have an all-female space. “Whenever I see a younger photographer being mentored by an older photographer, they’re usually men,” says Sharma. “The bros have always had a club.”</p>
<p>Certainly, sexism was in <a href="http://www.melinamara.com/">Melina Mara’s</a> mind in 2005, when she co-founded WPOW, which currently has over 200 members. In the “bastion of male power” that is the nation’s capital, Mara says, sexism was rife—whether that meant “being groped by [Senator] Strom Thurmond” (a routine occurrence, she says) or being invited by male colleagues to watch a video of lesbian mudwrestling. “We were in this whole period where women photojournalists were saying, Hey, I’m getting bashed here. I feel very alone, very isolated, and I need to know how to cope,” Mara recalls. “We wanted to support women photojournalists.” </p>
<p>The grande dame of these groups, WPOW became a registered nonprofit in 2007, and now hosts a variety of programs including quarterly meetings with guest speakers, a mentorship program, an annual portfolio review, seminars on the business of photography, and a monthly co-ed happy hour. “It gives that feeling of having a strong base—you’re not alone,” says Mara, who adds that when WPOW members have been laid off from staff jobs, WPOW has been active in helping them build connections and find work.</p>
<p>Though times have changed, (“We feel more supported, and we’ve educated some of the men,” says Mara), sexism still exists. Last year, a discussion about sexism in editorial photography was kicked off when <a href="http://www.danielpshea.com/">Daniel Shea</a>, a successful fine-art and editorial photographer, wrote a Tumblr post in which he wondered why relatively few women photographers get hired for editorial assignments. After reading the post, Los Angeles editorial photographer <a href="http://www.angiesmithphotography.com/">Angie Smith</a> compared the ratio of men to women photographers in 11 magazines: Only one had even numbers, and in most, male photographers outnumbered females by at least three to one. Sexism in the editorial photography world “is definitely a reality,” says Smith, who started a salon group of women photographers last year. </p>
<p>In New York, photographer <a href="http://www.jennifermcclure.com/">Jennifer McClure</a> had a similar finding in the fine-art world. After conducting an informal survey of New York art galleries that show photography, McClure found that “of the bigger and more established galleries, women average 20 percent.” A 2013 study by Chicago’s <a href="http://womanmade.org/">Woman Made Gallery</a> found similar results: While women make up 28 percent of artists represented by New York galleries, only 18 percent of solo shows in New York are by women. In June of this year, McClure posted on Facebook, asking women photographers in New York if they’d be interested in meeting monthly. The response was enormous. “I’m surprised; I thought maybe 20 people would be into it, but we already have 86,” says McClure, who has named her group the Women’s Photo Alliance. “It’s fantastic, very encouraging.” </p>
<p>The groups have an online presence: Many have closed Facebook groups, and WPOW, the biggest group, has an impressive website with online exhibitions and a blog (<a href="http://www.womenphotojournalists.org/#!/index">www.womenphotojournalists.org</a>). But for most members, the face-to-face gatherings are what it’s about—not only because photography can be isolating, but also because personal relationships are key to building professional connections. “There are a lot of assignments that, truthfully, we’re interchangeable for,” says Sharma. “In that case, it often comes down to how you connect with a person.”</p>
<p>However, say the organizers, anyone who mounts an aggressive sales pitch at these gatherings has the wrong idea. “We know they’re going to network: Every one of these women is ambitious, hungry and creative,” says Handler—but a photographer who showed up at a CWIP meeting with business cards and started handing them around was not given a warm welcome. “In terms of pimping yourself out, this is not the venue for that,” says Meiners. </p>
<p>Instead, the groups are providing creative ways for people to make connections and share experiences. In Santa Fe, SFWiP has hosted a museum walk-through and a hike—on which, says co-founder McCarthy, “I kept looking behind me and seeing people in really deep conversations.” Sharma’s dinner party group, which includes photographers and photo editors, has been doing a culinary world tour, with a risotto night, a taco night and a sushi-from-scratch night. During the food preparation, “people are discussing recent shoots and personal projects—there’s no shortage of chatter,” she says. </p>
<p>And, though many groups are relatively new, the connections are already paying off. Two of the groups have organized exhibitions: SFWiP had its first exhibition in July 2015, in local restaurant Counter Culture, and F8, a fine-art photography collective that formed as a result of the CWIP meetings, is having an exhibition in <a href="http://www.tamarkin.com/leicagallery/">Chicago’s Rangefinder Gallery</a> in February 2016.</p>
<p>McClure, too, says she envisages the Women’s Photo Alliance eventually having pop-up exhibitions and its own website. </p>
<p>“If we work together, we have a better chance of success,” she says. “Instead of going back to the same shrinking pie, we should be thinking differently. We should be thinking, ‘How do we make more pies?’”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[“When digital SLRs started shooting video, photographers became filmmakers and filmmakers became real filmmakers.” That was “real” filmmaker <a href="http://prolost.com/">Stu Maschwitz’s</a> quip, overheard at a Red Giant panel discussion at the <a href="https://www.nab.org/">National Association of Broadcasters (NAB)</a> trade show. He was talking about how the DSLR video revolution had spurred everyone in the business of creating video to step up their game. The same goes for video camera companies, who have responded to the rise of DSLR video by delivering cameras with wider dynamic ranges, faster frame rates and ever-higher-resolution sensors. Here are a few that recently caught our eye.
<p><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/8-Gear-Round-up-Aja-Cion-a.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>AJA CION</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://adorama.evyy.net/c/124294/51926/1036?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2FAJCION.html%3Fgclid%3DCIPRscjtxMcCFYiPHwoddGIGxw">AJA’s CION</a> is a 4K cinema camera sporting an APS-C-sized image sensor with a global shutter. It delivers 12 stops of dynamic range and records 12-bit 4K (4096x2160 pixels) video in the ProRes 4444 format at up to 30 frames per second. Slightly more compressed 422 footage can be captured internally to AJA’s SSD-based PAK Media cards at up to 60 fps. RAW footage output through an SDI connection can be delivered at up to 120 fps. The CION features a removable PL lens mount, giving users the option to install other lens mounts if desired. </p>
<p>At the NAB show, AJA rolled out several new firmware upgrades for the CION. Among the improvements is white balance control; overexposed portions of an image are less prone to color shifts. The firmware also delivers more gamma and color correction options for 800- and 1000-exposure index values. </p>
<p>If you’re curious about the CION but don’t want to commit without some serious hands-on time, the company is making 100 models available to filmmakers in the U.S. and Canada for free trials. When describing the program during the company’s press conference at NAB, AJA president Nick Rashby said the likely candidate was probably not so much a film student as a more “experienced DP.” Interested parties can apply at the AJA website. The promotion will expire at the end of the summer. To sweeten the deal, AJA is also shaving $4,000 off the CION’s $8,995 retail price throughout the summer.</p>

<p><strong>Arri Alexa Mini</strong></p>
<p>The popularity of drone and gimbal-based video recording is ushering in the age of the square cinema camera. <a href="http://www.arri.com/alexamini/">Arri’s new Mini</a> not only has the Alexa’s cinematic pedigree, but the price tag to match. The Mini features a carbon fiber camera body optimized for use with brushless gimbals, drones and other run-and-gun applications. The Mini weighs in at a svelte 5 pounds (body and PL lens mount) and measures 7.3 x 4.9 x 5.5 inches. It boasts a full-frame format Arri ALEV III CMOS sensor with an electronic shutter and 14 stops of dynamic range. It’s capable of 4K ProRes 4444 XQ recording (3840x2160) at up to 120 fps, or uncompressed ArriRAW format video at 2.8K at up to 30 fps to CFast 2.0 memory cards. Frame rates can hit 200 fps when recording internally at 2K in ProRes 4444. The active sensor area is switchable from a 4:3 aspect ratio to 16:9. </p>
<p>The Mini sports an interchangeable lens mount and is compatible with EF, PL or B4 lens mounts. The camera can be remotely controlled using either Arri’s Electronic Control System or Wi-Fi. It features a built-in motorized ND filter and offers a pair of HD-SDI outputs (1.5G and 3G) plus an SDI-6G output for use with Arri’s CODEX external recorder. </p>

<p><strong>Blackmagic Design Ursa Mini </strong></p>
<p>We were impressed with the Ursa when we reviewed it in the April issue, but one beef we had was the size and weight—the word “tank” sprang readily to mind when handling the substantial Ursa. <a href="http://adorama.evyy.net/c/124294/51926/1036?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2FBMURSAM46KEF.html">With the Mini</a>, Blackmagic has taken pity on the shoulders and forearms of filmmakers everywhere with a camera that retains many of the valuable features of the original but at a little more than 1/3 the weight (Don’t worry Ursa fans, the original isn’t going anywhere.) The new Mini weighs just 5 pounds, though it has to shed the Ursa’s three monitors to get there. Instead, you’ll have a single, 5-inch HD touchscreen monitor for framing and focus confirmation. The Mini records 4K footage to a pair of CFast 2.0 cards in Apple ProRes (up to 4444 XQ) or Cinema DNG 12-bit RAW. It has dual XLR inputs with phantom power, a built-in stereo mic and a 12G-SDI connection. </p>
<p>The Ursa Mini is sold with either Blackmagic’s new 4.6K Super 35mm-sized image sensor or an updated 4K sensor with slightly less resolution and 12 stops of dynamic range. The 4.6K (4608x2592) sensor boasts 15 stops of dynamic range and delivers 4K recording at 60 fps with a rolling shutter, or 4K at 30 fps with a global shutter. If you opt for the less-expensive Ursa Mini with the 4K sensor, you’ll enjoy 4K frame rates of 60 fps with a global shutter. Both versions of the Mini clock in at a motion-slowing 120 fps when shooting at 1920x1080 resolution.</p>

<p><strong>Canon XC10</strong></p>
<p>While the world waits for Canon to add 4K to its DSLRs, the company has taken a step toward the future with a new video camera. <a href="http://www.adorama.com/CAXC10.html">The XC10</a> delivers 3840x2160 (8-bit, 422) recording via a 1-inch, 13-megapixel CMOS sensor. Footage is saved internally to a CFast 2.0 memory card using a newly developed Canon codec dubbed XF-AVC. As the name implies, the codec is derived from H.264 and uses intra-frame compression to deliver a maximum bit rate of 305Mbps. You can also output a 4K Canon Log file at 30 fps with 12-stops of dynamic range to an external recorder via HDMI. HD video, plus 12-megapixel still photos, can be saved to an SD card. The XC10 strikes a boxy figure, the better for mounting on gimbals, but its rotating hand grip also gives run-and-gunners something to hang onto. And the XC10 is definitely easy to carry, measuring in at 4.9 x 4 x 4.8 inches and weighing a scant 2.3 pounds with battery and memory cards loaded. </p>
<p>There’s a built-in 10x zoom lens with a full-frame equivalent focal length of 27.3–273mm for video and 24.1–241mm for stills. The lens features a three-mode (dynamic, standard and powered) optical stabilizer to combat camera shake during a variety of uses. It features a maximum aperture of f/2.8 when shooting wide and stops down to f/5.6 at full telephoto. There’s a three-step ND filter built in, plus dedicated zoom and focus rings for manual operation. You’ll enjoy a native sensitivity range of ISO 160–20,000 and a 3-inch vari-angle display for framing your scene.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="http://www.adorama.com/CAXC10.html">$2,499</a> (64GB SanDisk CFast 2.0 card and reader included)</p>

<p><strong>JVC GY-LS300CHU</strong></p>
<p>The flagship of JVC’s new 4KCAM video lineup, <a href="http://adorama.evyy.net/c/124294/51926/1036?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2FJVGYLS300.html">the LS300</a> boasts a Super 35mm-sized 4K sensor and an active Micro Four Thirds lens mount. The sensor is capable of capturing 3840x2160p30 video with a bitrate up to 150Mbps and 12-stops of dynamic range. Footage is saved internally to a pair of SD cards in the H.264 codec (MOV files). While the LS300 can’t output a 4K signal for external recording, it does support 4K monitoring via HDMI and will downconvert 4K footage to HD for recording out of the HDMI or SDI connection. </p>
<p>If you just need to shoot HD, the camera supports 1920x1080p60 recording (422) at 50Mbps. There are two SD card slots with relay recording and hot-swapping capability so you can pull out memory cards while the LS300 is still recording. You’ll find a three-position ND filter and a two-channel XLR input with phantom power. The LS300 is very customizable, with 10 function buttons on the exterior that you can program to your heart’s desire. You frame your scene with a 3.5-inch display or a 0.24-inch viewfinder. Depending on where you purchase your LS300, it will come with either a free Rokinon prime lens or a Metabones lens adapter, so shop around. A shotgun mic is also included with the purchase.</p>

<p><strong>Panasonic AG-DVX200</strong></p>
<p>It seems like there are almost no cameras rolling out of Panasonic’s factories these days that don’t offer 4K video recording. The newest, <a href="http://adorama.evyy.net/c/124294/51926/1036?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2FPCAGDVX200.html">the AG-DVX200</a>, aims to bring the feel of the company’s cinematic VariCam lineup into a design and budget that’s more approachable. It’s a fixed-lens camcorder with a newly designed Four Thirds CMOS image sensor capable of 12 stops of dynamic range. According to Panasonic, the DVX200 offers the same tonality, log-curve and colorimetry as the company’s professional VariCam lineup.</p>
<p>The camera will record 4K (4096x2160) video at 24 fps as well as UHD (3840?2160) at up to 60 fps and Full HD up to 120 fps. Footage can be saved internally to a pair of SD cards in either MP4 or MOV file formats with options to record files to both cards simultaneously for backup or use a second card as overflow capacity. On the optics front, you’ll find a built-in 13x Leica Dicomar f/2.8–4.5 zoom lens with three manual rings for focus, iris and zoom and a 72mm front filter. The lens uses a five-axis hybrid image stabilizer to keep footage blur-free. Additional features include time-code in/out, 3G HD-SDI and HDMI 2.0 (4K) video outputs.</p>

Another major brain boost is improved data transfer speeds to RED’s Mini-Mag removable SSD memory. Thanks to the speed bump, the Weapon Dragon can record 6K Redcode RAW video up to 100 fps internally while also simultaneously saving 2K ProRes format video up to 120 fps in 4444 XQ quality. The Weapon also delivers 16.5 stops of dynamic, automatic sensor calibration, and internal timecode recording.</p>
<p>The Weapon Dragon will be sold in two versions, a magnesium brain and a slightly lighter (though much costlier) carbon fiber brain. The carbon fiber Weapon Dragon has more processing power, enabling simultaneous 2K ProRes recording at 120fps whereas the magnesium Weapon will top out at 60 fps.</p>
<p>If 6K sounds far too antiquated for your needs, RED will sell a Weapon Dragon brain with an 8K sensor (that’s 8192x4320 for you pixel-peepers) later this year for an extra $20,000. </p>

<p><strong>Sony PXW-X200</strong></p>
<p>At this year’s NAB trade show, Sony reaffirmed its commitment to roll out a continuous stream of firmware updates for existing hardware rather than simply churn out new models. To that end, the company’s <a href="http://www.adorama.com/SOPXWX200.html">PXW-X200</a>—introduced in the fall of last year—has had a fresh firmware upgrade that enables streaming video over wired and wireless LANs, as well as over 3G and 4G mobile networks using an optional wireless module. The new firmware also saves GPS data to metadata when recording in Sony’s XAVC-I/L codec and supports simultaneous video recording to two SxS media cards. </p>
<p>Outside of the firmware upgrades, the X200 sports a fixed 17x optical zoom lens (29.3–499mm full-frame equivalent) and three, 1/2-inch CMOS sensors. It can record HD video at 422/10-bit using the XAVC codec with bit rates topping off at 112Mbps using intra-frame compression. The lens has three manual rings for focus, zoom and iris control. You’ll find a 3G-SDI interface for outputting a 1920x1080p60 signal, cinema-friendly picture profiles, time code in/out and focus assist. You’ll frame your scene through a 3.5-inch LCD display or a 0.45-inch LCD viewfinder.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[On April 8, 1961, the MV Dara, a Dubai-based passenger liner, was destroyed at sea by an internal explosion. Engulfed in flames, the British-India Steam Navigation Company vessel eventually sank off the coast of Dubai, and 238 of the 819 people aboard perished. This tragic incident serves as the anchor for British documentary photographer <a href="http://www.oliviaarthur.com/">Olivia Arthur’s</a> unique new book, <em><a href="http://fishbar.ph/shop/stranger">Stranger</a></em> <a href="http://fishbar.ph/shop/stranger">(Fishbar)</a>. 
<p>In Arthur’s underwater images, the sea is a monochromatic olive drab; small fish dart through the barnacled netting that surrounds the wreckage, sediment heavy in the shallow water. In one image, a primordial glow seems to issue from the murk, like a fire deep within a cave. On land, the sun is relentless, refracting off glittering glass towers and luxury vehicles as democratically as it beats upon the shoulders of the window washer and migrant laborer. And above, airplanes hang, Icarian flashes of silver in an empty sky.</p>
<p>Arthur has a long history of working in the Middle East and Asia. After earning a mathematics degree from Oxford University and graduating a photojournalism course at London College of Communication, she moved to India in 2003. Arthur spent two and a half years there living and working as a freelance photographer before she won a scholarship from Fabrica, the communications research center, and relocated to Italy in 2006. She then began new work, focused on young women she met in her travels along the borders of Europe and Asia, which would become her award-winning project “The Middle Distance.” By 2012, she was a Magnum Photos associate (she is now a full member), and published her first book, <em><a href="http://fishbar.ph/shop/jeddah-diary">Jeddah Diary</a></em>, an intimate portrait of women in Saudi Arabia. It was that book that opened the door for <em>Stranger</em>, her most conceptually challenging work to date.</p>
<p>Through Magnum, <a href="http://www.cuadroart.com/">Cuadro Gallery in Dubai</a> was introduced to <em>Jeddah Diary</em> and invited Arthur to apply for a three-month residency, wherein Arthur would, as she puts it, “be able to pretty much do whatever I wanted.” She was still mulling over several ideas when she arrived in Dubai in early 2013, but settled quickly on what would become <em>Stranger</em>. She wanted to explore the history of Dubai, a counterintuitive notion in a city that sees itself as a beacon of modernity in the Arab world. She came upon the circumstances of the MV Dara in her online research and found inspiration in a particular story.</p>
<p>“I read about a family who had lost their son in the shipwreck but believed he had survived. They are still looking for him, more than 50 years later,” she explains. “I ‘borrowed’ the eyes of such a survivor...as I continued to make my way through the city, using this story, hearing the history, the stories of the shipwreck, what life had been like in those days and how much it has changed, and yet not changed, in the time since.” </p>
<p>This adopted perspective fit with what she was experiencing, wandering alone in a foreign city only to return to an empty hotel room. The isolation and loneliness is palpable in the finished work, but Arthur also took care to stay in character, eschewing images she thought reflected her “Western perspective” as opposed to that of the “curious stranger.” </p>
<p>The images show workers tending to massive fountains at the base of glass skyscrapers; children on an indoor ski hill; a fish-market worker reaching into a van to retrieve a shark; a man scattering a flock of pigeons in a old part of the city; a dummy dressed as a traffic manager propped up at an intersection; men in their undershirts swimming at night in the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>Arthur shot much of the work with her trusty Hasselblad. But as part of stepping outside her own perspective, she also used a Mamiya 6, in addition to shooting some 35mm digital. For the underwater images she experimented with several options before settling on a Canon in a soft, waterproof case. </p>
<p>While working, Arthur gathered historical text she intended to use in the book, but in the end decided it detracted from the narrative. Instead, she went back to Dubai in March of 2014, and, with the help of an assistant and translator, conducted interviews with people she encountered, from which she culled the text used in <em>Stranger</em>. “I wanted them to be snippets of conversations that the character might have overheard on his journeys through the city. All the quotes are voices I actually heard and recorded,” she says. </p>
<p>When it came time to put the book together, Arthur felt putting the text on the same page as the images turned them into “captions,” but she didn’t want the snippets of text marooned on empty white pages either. “I wanted to create the feeling of the journey through the city with the things he would see and the voices and conversations he would hear, so the voices jump in and out telling little anecdotes and pieces of the puzzle,” she explains. </p>
<p>The book designer she was working with, Melanie Mues, showed her <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Yoshie-Watanabe-Yayako-Uchida-English/dp/489815168X">Brooch</a></em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Yoshie-Watanabe-Yayako-Uchida-English/dp/489815168X">, a picture book by Japanese artists Yoshie Watanabe and Yayako Uchida printed entirely on transparent paper</a>. Arthur was immediately interested, and suggested instead of merely putting the text on transparent paper, they should use it for the whole book. </p>
<p>“I began thinking about how it would reflect not only the watery feel of the shipwreck images, but also the flimsy nature of things in Dubai,” Arthur explains. “I had to completely re-edit the book to make it work.” </p>
<p>It was an ambitious change, and one that proved more challenging than she imagined. Just finding a manufacturer willing to take on the job was a transnational odyssey of baffled printers and paper stock comparisons. “In Europe, no one had printed on this particular type of paper before, so no one was willing to really give [me] a quote. I was having quite complicated conversations with Japanese printers about it,” Arthur laughs. </p>
<p>There were times when she considered going back to something more conventional, but found herself unable to abandon an idea that seemed tailor-made for her project. It certainly helped that she didn’t have to convince a skeptical publisher: Arthur and her husband Phillipp—an accomplished artist in his own right—co-own <a href="http://fishbar.ph/">Fishbar</a>, a London gallery and publishing imprint. In the end, her perseverance won out when she found a Belgian press willing to take on the job early this year. Still, the entire process took much longer than Arthur had anticipated, and the wait was quite stressful. “With other books you could make a dummy and have a pretty good idea of how it was going to look, but because of the overlay [effect] there was no way to really know until you had the finished book in your hands,” she says. </p>
<p>There is an undercurrent of melancholy to <em>Stranger</em>, perhaps akin to the bustling solitude of an airport bar. The excerpts of text in the book are primarily those of travelers, workers and migrants, echoing the journey of our presumptive narrator. Lone figures in this acropolis of glass and steel, they warn and cajole in equal measure, of gold earned and lost. And under the water, the ship sits, patient.</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[As traditional sources of assignments shrink their budgets, photographers are seeking new ways to fund their work. That’s created stiff competition for photo grants, and has led to loads of photographers clamoring to get their crowdfunding campaigns noticed and supported. 
<p>Photographers who have found a variety of ways to support their work have shared their advice and experience with <em>PDN</em> over the years. The articles and tips are available to <em>PDN </em>subscribers via PDNOnline.com (<a href="https://emeraldexpo.omeda.com/cgi-win/npdn.cgi?mode=gmpage&amp;p=710NWEB">log in required</a>). </p>

<p><strong>Brian Ulrich: On Creating, Funding and Sustaining a Long-Term Fine-Art Project</strong></p>
<p>Near the start of what would become “Copia,” his decade-long project examining American consumerism, photographer <a href="http://notifbutwhen.com/">Brian Ulrich</a> got some useful advice from photo dealer Sarah Hasted about building support for his work: “It doesn’t matter if they don’t like it, just show it to them.” Ulrich explains, “So I would make trips to New York and just try and get the work in front of people and it didn’t necessarily matter if it was editorial or if it was an art gallery or it was a collector.” On shooting for magazines, he says, “If the assignment was two days, I could make it four and work on my things once their things were done. That stuff was crucial because those were like mini fellowships.” Ulrich also explains how he maintained momentum on the many aspects of the series, which became an exhibition and a monograph published in 2011 by Aperture. </p>

<p><strong>How to Win Grants that Support Your Photo Projects </strong></p>
<p>Photographer <a href="http://www.saraterry.com/">Sara Terry</a>, founder of the <a href="http://theaftermathproject.org/">Aftermath Project</a>, estimates she has won grants totaling nearly $1 million over the last 15 years. She has become a professional grant writer, and says photographers need to write in a way that explains their proposal clearly, conversationally and with immediacy. “You’re not writing for Congressmen or bankers. You want to be able to communicate in a clear and dynamic way to someone you care about.” She also offers advice on how to determine what grant jurors and foundations are looking for from year to year. </p>

<p><strong>Visibility, Personal Appeals and Other Keys to a Successful Kickstarter Campaign </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.scouttufankjian.com/">Scout Tufankjian</a> explains how she created a Kickstarter campaign for her book on the Armenian Diaspora that earned $60,000 and expanded the scope of her work. In building connections with potential donors, Facebook and direct emails proved to be the photographer’s most effective tools. She was helped by the fact that she had already invested time and money into producing photos around the world, giving donors the feeling they were helping to “push it over the top, rather than helping something get off the ground.” </p>

<p>When fine-art photographer <a href="http://manjarisharma.com/">Manjari Sharma</a> turned to Kickstarter to fund production of new images in her “Darshan” series depicting Hindu deities, she managed to get 70 percent of her funding from strangers, but notes that communicating and following up with donors “was more time-consuming than I had ever imagined.” </p>

<p><strong>Partnering With Non-Profits: Dana Romanoff, Dan Habib, Anna Maria Barry-Jester</strong></p>
<p>Over about four years, Habib raised $250,000 for production, distribution and outreach from charitable foundations and disability groups interested in using <em><a href="http://www.includingsamuel.com/home.aspx">Including Samuel</a></em>, Habib’s 2008 advocacy film, to reach audiences of students, parents, educators and medical professionals. Featuring Habib’s son, the film addresses the benefits and challenges of including physically challenged kids in regular school settings. Habib and two other documentary photographers explain how—and why—they partnered with educational institutions, advocacy groups, healthcare companies, and others who recognize the power of photojournalism to disseminate a message. </p>

<p><strong>Q&amp;A: Getting Funding from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting</strong></p>
<p>Founded in 2006 to support investigative journalism in the wake of newsroom budget cuts and shrinking opportunities for freelance assignments, the <a href="http://pulitzercenter.org/">Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting</a> has supported a variety of documentary photo essays—typically shot by a photographer working in collaboration with a writer to produce images and text on under-covered issues. The Pulitzer Center provides both financial support for producing the work and also helps promote the finished work on a number of platforms. In this interview with <em>PDN</em>, the center’s managing director Nathalie Applewhite explains how the non-profit supports production of new documentary projects and how photojournalists can strengthen their proposals. </p>

<p><strong>What Can an Artist in Residency Do For Your Career</strong></p>
<p>Artist in residency programs vary widely in the amenities they offer to a photographer, but the common factor is that they provide an artist with the means and time to focus solely on a project in the works. Whether they are sponsored by a small arts organization or a government-funded agency, each has an appeal—be it beautiful facilities, a helpful staff, a generous stipend, an idyllic setting or post-residence exhibition opportunities. <em>PDN</em> interviewed five artists to learn how they landed, and benefitted, from artist in residency programs. </p>

<p><strong>How I Got That Grant: <a href="http://www.aaronsiskind.org/grant.html">The Aaron Siskind Foundation Individual Photographer's Fellowship</a></strong></p>
<p>Worth up to $10,000 each, the grants support contemporary photographers, and the application is relatively easy. Applicants aren't required to explain how they will use the award, or get letters of recommendation. The judging guidelines are broad. But competition for the grants is fierce. <em>PDN</em> asked past jurors about their process of evaluating the submissions they saw, and past winners described what they submitted.   </p>

<p><strong>How I Got That Grant: Josef Sywenkyj on Winning the 2014 W. Eugene Smith Grant</strong></p>
<p>The photographer had been a finalist for the grant twice before, and applied "probably 8 or 10 times." His win in 2014 was about more than persistence: <a href="http://www.josephsywenkyj.com/">Sywenkyj</a> explains how he refined his written proposal and how he organized a portfolio that reflected his commitment to his subjects. </p>

<p><strong>How I Got That Grant: VSCO's Artist Initiative Program</strong></p>
<p>Since launching its Artist Initiative program last March, <a href="https://vsco.co/">Visual Supply Co (VSCO)</a> has awarded grants to support a variety of new projects by at least 14 artists, including nine photographers. The process is decidedly less-formal than that of most other photography grants. And so far, VSCO has awarded most of the grants to emerging photographers whose work straddles the boundary between documentary and fine-art photography. <a href="http://www.joshwool.com/">Josh Wool</a> and brothers <a href="http://cschoonover.tumblr.com/">Chris</a> and <a href="http://jonathanschoonover.com/">Jon Schoonover</a> explain how they approached VSCO for support. </p>

<p><strong>Direct Appeal: Grass-Roots Funding for Photo Projects</strong></p>
<p>Before crowd-funding platforms like Kickstarter took off, photographers were generating their own funds by appealing directly to groups of private donors, including friends and strangers. Photographers <a href="http://www.floriophoto.com/">Jason Florio</a>, <a href="http://www.rachelsussman.com/">Rachel Sussman</a> (creator of "The Oldest Living Things in the World" series), and <a href="http://www.borotov.com/">Rob Hornstra</a> explain how they set a fundraising goal, the information they shared with funding partners, and how they built communities of people interested in the subjects they were covering. </p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[When Patrick Witty, <em>WIRED</em> magazine’s director of photography, was given a story about illegal sand mining to illustrate with photos, he knew photographing the story would prove challenging. At its center was a murder in the rural Indian village of Raipur, of a farmer who dared speak out against the sand mine in the village and the gangsters who controlled it.
<p>The writer, <a href="http://www.vincebeiser.com/">Vince Beiser</a>, had used contacts at non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in India to help report the story, but by the time Witty was ready to assign a photographer to shoot it, the political climate had changed. The illegal sand trade is conducted out in the open, enabled by government officials paid to look the other way. Publicity is the enemy, and while a writer can appear inconspicuous, a photographer with a professional camera rig is another story. But Witty was confident he had the right photographer for the job.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adamfergusonphoto.com/">Adam Ferguson</a> cut his teeth doing small assignments in the region for <em>The New York Times</em>, where Witty was previously an international photo editor. When Witty moved to <em>TIME </em>magazine, he sent Ferguson into combat zones in Afghanistan. Ferguson shot with an audio recorder draped around his neck, and brought back the sounds of war—heavy breathing, rifle cracks and explosions. He had Witty’s confidence, and with his years of working in India, he seemed uniquely suited for the job. “I could send a lot of photographers that would do amazing work there, because visually the subject is pretty amazing,” Witty says. “But someone with the knowledge and the contacts on their own, I knew that’s what it would take to make this work.”</p>
<p>It may seem curious that a man was killed over sand. The idea of sand as a valuable commodity may not be discussed much in the West, but Asia’s rapid development requires billions of tons of concrete. According to the historian Vaclav Smil, China alone used more concrete from 2011–2013 (6.6 gigatons) than the United States did in the entire 20th century (4.5 gigatons). Concrete requires sand, and desert sand—polished by wind, as opposed to water—is unsuitable because the grains are too smooth and too small. There are many legal sand mines run by corporations throughout the world, but for a poor rural village in India such as Raipur—where middle-aged farmer Paleram Chauhan was murdered for protesting the local mine—the most valuable resource might just be the sand beneath their feet. The nearby city of Noida, which Ferguson likens to a New Delhi suburb, has recently experienced rapid economic growth, and with it, an increased appetite for concrete, and therefore, sand. “A lot of the international IT companies have set up their headquarters out in these areas,” Ferguson says. “There’s a lot of construction, there’s a growing Indian middle class out there. All that is fueling the sand mining industry.” </p>
<p>Reporting for <em>WIRED</em>, Beiser found that the illegal mines weren’t all hidden in rural areas, far from view; often they could be found just on the outskirts of small cities like Noida. Outside Mumbai, boats carried migrant workers from Bangladesh and other parts of India down the rivers to where they meet the Indian Ocean—diving to the bottom to scoop buckets full of sand into the boats at the surface. All across India, in places like Raipur, the environmental impact is dire; India’s Supreme Court even warned that riparian sand mining is compromising infrastructure, killing birds and fish and disrupting ecosystems. </p>
<p>Several NGOs work in India to protect the environments and threatened ecosystems, and Beiser’s contacts there helped him report the story. Before he left home, Ferguson received a copy of the story and all of Beiser’s NGO contacts. But when the photographer arrived in Mumbai for his week-long assignment, the NGOs held him at arm’s length. He suspects they feared repercussions for bringing a foreign photographer to document illegal activity. So Ferguson and his fixer, Ravi Mishra, did some digging, found a few leads, and broke out on their own. They headed north to Uttar Pradesh, just outside New Delhi, to visit Chauhan’s family. Ferguson took their portraits and saw the illegal mine in the village, just steps from Chauhan’s door. When the pair returned to Mumbai, they visited Thane Creek, and caught the sand divers they had hoped to find there. They soon found the boats that freighted away the sand on the river.</p>
<p>Ferguson managed to avoid any physical danger, his closest brush with violence being some angry, threatening phone calls while shooting on location at the mine in Raipur. “That was a bit tense down there,” Ferguson says. “There had been a death in the village, [and] everyone knew who did it. These guys were out on bail, they were well-connected.” </p>
<p>Ferguson and Mishra typically moved quickly, doing their best to avoid attention and using back roads when possible. Ferguson carried a minimal kit, just a single Canon EOS 5D Mark III and a 35mm lens. The workers—who toiled crushing rocks and washing sand—were mostly unconcerned with his presence, says Ferguson. Rather, the people plundering the resources, mining municipal land that belonged to the villagers without sharing the profits—they had the problem with the new publicity for their illegal activities, and let Ferguson and Mishra know they were unwelcome. “I really defaulted to Ravi to make the decision of when we’d leave,” Ferguson admits. “And we pushed it pretty hard in some places.”</p>
<p>When he returned home to Thailand, Ferguson sent a 40-image edit to Witty. Witty ended up publishing most of them. “Adam has such good taste, he’s an excellent self-editor,” Witty says. “A lot of photographers aren’t.”</p>
<p>Once in the hands of the team at <em>WIRED</em>, the text and photos were then edited for three different versions of the story. They included <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/03/illegal-sand-mining/">a longform, infinite-scroll-layout version of the full story</a> to be published first on wired.com, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/04/adam-ferguson-illegal-sand-mining/">a photo-centric blog post on wired.com/photo</a> that ran with a 22-photo slideshow, and a printed story. The latter was produced in what <em>WIRED</em> calls “centerfold style,” which is meant to be read with the magazine turned on its side, with horizontal images taking up single pages and two-image spreads [inset]. Each edit was tailored to each platform, giving readers a reason to seek out the feature in more than one place.</p>
<p>Ferguson was particularly pleased with his shot of the massive concrete buildings in Uttar Pradesh, which gives a glimpse into the end result of the illegal mining.</p>
<p>“Three quarters of the way through this trip, I was looking at my pictures, like, ‘Something is missing here.’ I’d taken pictures of what the sand looks like standing in the sky, [but what’s] the end result? I went to these new little satellite cities on the outskirts of Delhi…these empty concrete towers are the result of where this sand ends up. It’s one of the strongest pictures I made out there.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Depending on your inclination, the mobile revolution has either been a boon to productivity or a deathblow to downtime, enabling us to squeeze in work when we would otherwise be idle. For photographers, mobile devices have matured not simply as cameras but as tools for editing, organizing and synchronizing photo libraries captured with DSLRs and mirrorless cameras. 
<p>Despite this progress, the mobile workflow is still fragmented. How much you’ll get done and how efficient you’ll be depends heavily on the capabilities of your camera, your mobile device and the apps you’ve elected to use. While the JPEG workflow on mobile devices is robust, RAW capabilities are still embryonic. </p>
<p>Still, it’s getting easier to leave the laptop at home, even if the photographers we spoke with are still a bit reluctant to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Camera&gt;Phone</strong></p>
<p>While Wi-Fi is by no means universal on professional-grade cameras, it’s increasingly becoming the rule rather than the exception. With in-camera Wi-Fi comes companion apps for Android and iOS devices that support remote operation and image transfers from memory card to phone (or tablet). Most of these apps—from Canon, Nikon, Sony, etc.—won’t transfer RAW files—only JPEGs—to mobile devices, on the theory that all you really need to do on your phone is post the image to social media. </p>
<p>For photographer <a href="http://tamaralackey.com/">Tamara Lackey</a>, that’s indeed been the primary use for in-camera Wi-Fi. “I primarily use camera Wi-Fi for rapid sharing—sharing images with clients and for social media sharing,” she says. </p>
<p>In cases where in-camera Wi-Fi isn’t available, wireless memory cards like <a href="http://amzn.to/1fpLqgF">Eyefi’s Mobi Pro</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/1LlknS7">Toshiba’s FlashAir</a> can tackle wireless transfers from camera to mobile device. In the case of the Mobi Pro card (reviewed in this month's issue) it also transfers RAW images, making it one of the few wireless solutions available for moving RAW images from camera to phone. Another option is the <a href="http://amzn.to/1PmzNnc">CamRanger</a> ($300–$365), which is a bulkier, more costly solution than the $99 Mobi Pro, but also a lot more functional, providing not just the ability to transfer RAW files to mobile devices, but extensive camera remote-control options as well.</p>
<p>If moving RAW images to a mobile device is a priority, you can bypass the vagaries of Wi-Fi and camera apps and connect the old-fashioned way. <a href="http://amzn.to/1PmzOY1">Apple’s Camera Connection Kits</a> are available for both 30-pin and Lightning connections for about $30. Card readers with micro USB ports for Android devices can be had for under $10.</p>
<p>While there’s no shortage of apps that can edit JPEG images on phones and tablets, the selection dwindles sharply for editing RAW images. Apple devices can save RAW files, but the iOS Photos app will only display the embedded JPEG preview that most RAW files create. Any edits you make in Photos impact that preview, but you can only share JPEGs, not RAW images, from Apple’s native app (you can upload the RAW file to iTunes, but it’s a circuitous process). </p>
<p>Still, third-party iOS apps like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photogene-4/id363448251?mt=8">Photogene</a> ($3) and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photoraw/id413899112?mt=8">PhotoRaw</a> ($10) can edit a wide variety of RAW images. And with Photogene, you can export XMP sidecar files that can be read by programs like Adobe Lightroom when you want to switch to desktop editing. </p>
<p>Android has a slightly more robust eco-system for RAW files now that <a href="https://www.android.com/versions/lollipop-5-0/">Android Lollipop</a> supports RAW (DNG format) photo capture. Popular apps like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed&amp;hl=en">Google’s Snapseed</a> can now edit DNG files, while <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tssystems.photomate2&amp;hl=en">Photo Mate R2</a> ($9.50) can non-destructively edit and process RAW files from a variety of cameras.</p>
<p>For photographers who want to keep their mobile and desktop activities under one roof, Adobe has been slowly building up the capabilities of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/lightroom-mobile.html">Lightroom Mobile</a>. Unlike the apps mentioned above, Lightroom Mobile can only import or edit a RAW file directly in Android, not iOS, which is why for iPhone-toting photographers like <a href="http://dancarrphotography.com/">Dan Carr</a>, taking Lightroom on the road still starts with a laptop. </p>
<p>“There’s a great new feature that snuck under the radar in Lightroom 6, and that’s the ability to immediately put photos into a collection on import,” Carr says. It’s these collections that sync with Lightroom Mobile and give Carr the ability to leave the laptop behind and work on his files on his iPhone 6 Plus. This work consists primarily of culling down the day’s shoot, rejecting images, assigning ratings and, occasionally, a few light edits. “I’ll go through a shoot whenever it’s convenient—while I’m traveling, while I’m waiting for the light,” he says. For Carr, this mobile culling has proven to be a big time saver. “I hate sitting in front of a computer and this lets me get back outside and focus more on shooting,” he says.</p>
<p>Lightroom Mobile syncs small, DNG-based “Smart Previews” with the Creative Cloud server. These lightweight files can be edited and rated even when the mobile device itself is offline, with changes syncing back to the desktop version and the full-resolution files once you’re back online. </p>
<p>Indeed, file synchronization is becoming a key feature as files move between camera, mobile device, laptops and storage drives. The <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/eye-fi/id306011124?mt=8">Eyefi app</a> that accompanies the wireless memory card can transfer and sync both JPEG and RAW images across desktop and mobile devices, plus archive files in its own cloud service, but it will only sync JPEG edits, not RAW edits.</p>
<p>Lackey has used the relatively new <a href="http://mylio.com/">Mylio software</a> to automate her archiving, since it keeps RAW edits synced as well. Like Carr, she still starts at her laptop to ingest RAW files but then leverages Mylio for archiving efficiency. Prior to Mylio, Lackey would download a shoot onto an external drive, then manually back the images up to a wireless server and a cloud storage service. Now, she says, it’s a simple import into Mylio where the program “manages all those duplications for me automatically.” </p>
<p>The mass synchronization provides another benefit. “From a marketing perspective, it’s been really powerful,” Lackey says. “Any image I want to show someone, anytime, anywhere, I have it with me all the time.”</p>
<p><strong>The Case for Convertibles</strong></p>
<p>One way to make an end-run around your mobile device’s RAW limitations is to spring for a more functional mobile device. While Apple have long been a favorite of the creative community, Microsoft’s Windows 8 (soon to be Windows 10) has created a new hardware category tailor-made for the mobile creative—the hybrid, or convertible. It’s a device that blends the portability of a tablet with the power of a laptop. You can use a convertible exactly as you would a smartphone or iPad—transferring images via Wi-Fi—or you can take advantage of the convertible’s more generous selection of inputs to attach card readers, external drives and keyboard covers, and work with it like a typical notebook. </p>
<p>More importantly, you won’t have to settle for the mobile variants of your favorite tools. Take Microsoft’s own <a href="http://amzn.to/1PmAg8J">Surface Pro 3</a> ($800). It’s a 12-inch tablet that can run full versions of Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, and includes a stylus for pen-based editing. There’s only a microSD card slot on the Surface Pro 3, but thanks to its full-sized USB 3.0 port, you can connect card readers and external storage drives to transfer and backup your RAW images. Toshiba’s Portege Z20t and Wacom’s Cintiq Companion 2 boast similar functionality (and the Wacom can double as an editing tablet when connected to a PC). If you own a Mac computer, Adobe’s Creative Cloud license lets you install Photoshop and Lightroom on a secondary computer, even if it’s—gasp—running Windows.</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.jamesfarrellphoto.com/">James Farrell</a> specializes in photographing all types of sports action, from BMX cycling to skiing to tennis for sports action brands as well as <em>Men’s Fitness, Sports Illustrated, Prevention, Runner’s World </em>and other magazines.
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What appeals to you about sports action photography?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JF: </strong>The dynamic energy of showing somebody doing something is really important to me. I love to photograph active people doing what they do best, whether it’s a boxer, or a marathoner, or a triathlete. I love the idea of getting to know a person through what they’re doing.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How did you get started?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JF:</strong> I went to Northern Michigan University [where I lived with] really good skiers. I photographed people flying through the air, going off jumps. That’s all I did for three or four years, following them around the country. At some point I realized there had to be more ways to photograph people. After I graduated, I moved to Chicago, and [started photographing] parkour athletes. As soon as I moved to New York, it was a progression into the fitness industry. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: When did you move to New York?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JF: </strong>I moved in 2008, in the middle of the recession. There was nothing going on. I interned at <a href="http://fastashleysstudios.com/">Fast Ashleys Studios</a> in Brooklyn for six or eight months, and then I spent the next two or three years assisting and shooting.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How did you get your first clients?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JF:</strong> A lot of where I am today is because of an agent (Topher DesPr&eacute;s) at Wilhelmina Models. I took my book to him, and it was all pictures of skiers and BMX and things like that. He was the first person to believe in me in New York, and he started sending me models that I could work with.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: To do tests shoots for your portfolio, and theirs?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JF:</strong> Correct. It really started with that access to the models. That was while I was assisting. Then I went to the <a href="http://www.nycfotoworks.com/#intro">NYCFotoWorks portfolio review</a>, and from that one event, I got one of my first big clients, which is <em>Men’s Fitness</em>. It all built from there.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What are your favorite sports to shoot?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JF:</strong> I love the action sports, by that I mean skateboarding, BMX, freestyle skiing, motocross—things of that nature. Those are small industries, so the athletes have incentive to work with you to make the best image possible.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Do you shoot everything with the camera locked down?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JF:</strong> Yeah, everything I do is for the most part well-planned. I’m not following [competitions], hoping I get the moment. I’m controlling the location and the shoot to get what I want out of it.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Are you doing location shoots at your own studio, and do you have a long runway?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JF: </strong>Most people assume you need a lot of space [for the athlete] to get up to speed, but you don’t need people running as fast as they can to get the image. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: So how big is your studio?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JF: </strong>It’s 15 x 15 feet. I can really make a lot of images on white in that space. But then I have a larger space that I share. It’s probably 20 feet wide by 40 feet deep, so there’s plenty of space for shooting people doing workouts and moving and jumping. You learn to take the space you have and make it work. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What’s a typical studio assignment like?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JF: </strong>For magazines, I often shoot on white to make composite images to show workout moves. When I shoot for <em>Fitness</em> magazine, I work with a fitness editor, who comes in to look at the model’s form to make sure it is correct so people aren’t getting injured. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What are location assignments like?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JF:</strong> I did a shoot for <em>Triathlete</em> magazine, about a competitive eater who was also a triathlete. There was no art director on set. They gave me free reign to go out and do what I wanted to do, but they needed food in the picture to convey that the subject was a competitive eater. So we went and got a huge tray of hot dogs and donuts, and we went out to Greenpoint [in Brooklyn], where there are all these piers that go out overlooking the city. I had locations already scouted. In my off time, I bike around, and look for walls and places that are going to be nice to photograph. I knew of a location for this shoot where the light would be right, so I wouldn’t have to overly light the photo to enhance it. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How much are you lighting your images?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JF:</strong> I used to light a lot more, but in the last two years, I’ve been doing less lighting, and I allow myself to not worry about all the lights being in the perfect place at the perfect time. I like to find locations where light is already good, and I add a little light to make it better.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Why did you change your lighting approach?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JF:</strong> It’s an evolution. I started to develop a different taste and esthetic. I’m not saying you can’t light mood with strobes, but a lot of my strobe lighting became very flat. My way to handle that was to use different modifiers, and use less light. My work has evolved to a new place as a result. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What is your lighting kit?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JF: </strong>On location, my typical lighting setup is Profoto Pro-B4 1000 Air battery packs, and my modifiers switch between Profoto Magnum reflectors and Elinchrom Octa Light Bank reflectors, depending on what I’m shooting. If I need a harder light source to freeze the action, I choose the Magnum reflectors. On a typical location shoot, I’ll bring three lights. But on a recent shoot, I used only one of them.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What cameras do you use?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JF: </strong>I have a Nikon D810 and a Phase One medium-format camera. Which one I use depends upon how much light and how much time I have to shoot. The Phase One takes a little more time, and you have to shoot tethered and use a little more lighting. So if I go into a situation, and realize we have 20 minutes to shoot, I might go with the 35mm (Nikon D810) because I know we can crank up the ISO up and just go, working with ambient light and strobes for fill light.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What are the biggest challenges of photographing athletes in action? </strong></p>
<p><strong>JF:</strong> Having enough time is always the biggest factor. I’m not the photographer who holds down the shutter and shoots a million frames on burst mode. When you work with an athlete, it takes time to teach them: “This is how I work. I know you have worked with other photographers who maybe do something different.” Sometimes you have to get them to believe in you and trust you to get them to do what they need to do.</p>
<p>Once I was photographing <a href="http://www.sanyarichardsross.com/">Sanya Richards-Ross</a> and her PR person asked, “Why are you shooting only one frame every time she runs?” Sonia didn’t want to run 50 times. She wanted me to shoot 50 or 100 frames on burst mode and just choose one, and I had to show her what happens when you just push the button and lose that decisive moment. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Is there any difference between photographing fitness images of women vs. men?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JF: </strong>I definitely have two different techniques. With women, a fitness image also has to be beautiful. In magazines, nasty looking shadows don’t look good on women. With men, the images have to be gritty—I try to do something more with mood and shadow with the males.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you achieve those differences?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JF:</strong> It’s the choice of modifiers, and where it is placed. With women, it’s more over camera, and with men, I can pull it off at 45 degrees. In general, to photograph a woman, I would definitely use a key light and a fill light. I would have fill light to keep it lit head to toe, and key light would be like a deep Octa Bank to give it some shape on the face, but not have any hard shadows. Whereas with men, I would use that deep Octa Bank, and I probably wouldn’t even use the fill light. Or I would switch to a Photek Softlighter II so we have a much smaller source of light, so there’s less light spreading all over the whole frame.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Is the fitness photography market really competitive?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JF: </strong>In New York, there’s a group of four or five photographers. We all know each other, and there’s enough work for all of us. We stay fairly busy. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Do you market yourself? Is your business mostly repeat clients at this point?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JF:</strong> I just did a re-branding of my website, and I’m working on a new portfolio now. My old website wasn’t current enough. People weren’t spending enough time, which I could tell from Google analytics. Art directors and photo editors want to be able to go to your site and see what you do quickly. My old website didn’t let them do that. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What do you aspire to now, in terms of clients and work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JF:</strong> I love shooting editorial work, but [landing] larger and larger commercial clients is always a photographer’s goal. Editorial work is the stepping stone to get across the river. And all these stepping stones teach you little morsels of what you need to know to do something larger.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What’s your advice to other photographers who aspire to get into this niche?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JF: </strong>Look at what other people are doing, and do something different. You want to get to where if someone looks at your image, they can say: I know James Farrell took that image.</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<a href="http://totemcreative.com/">Totem Creative</a> is a design agency founded in Manhattan in 2012. Working with fashion retailers such as Bloomingdales and Lord &amp; Taylor, the agency has carved out a niche producing catalogues and marketing materials that feel like editorial products—more magazine than mail-order. <em>PDN </em>recently spoke with Geraldine Hessler and Robert Festino, two creative directors working closely together on the Lord &amp; Taylor account. They tell us how they hire photographers and produce a book that’s neither editorial nor advertising, but a little bit of both.
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: You both started at Totem less than a year ago. What were you doing before?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Geraldine Hessler:</strong> I worked at magazines for 25 years. I was the creative director at <em>Glamour</em>, and before that I worked at <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> and <em>Rolling Stone</em>, so I have a strong editorial background and a lot of experience. I was at <em>Glamour</em> for six years, and we shot a ton of fashion and beauty and a lot of celebrity.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Festino:</strong> I had an art direction background. I worked for magazines for many years in editorial. I originally started out at <em>Vogue, Bon Appetit, Fortun</em>e…I was an art director at <em>ESPN the Magazine</em>, and creative director for three years at <em>Men’s Health</em>. Two years ago I broke away from magazines and started doing advertising and marketing. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What does Totem do for Lord &amp; Taylor?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RF:</strong> Totem’s approach is a very editorial approach to fashion marketing. Images feel real, in the moment, not necessarily posed. We’re primarily doing catalogue work for Lord &amp; Taylor right now, women’s fashion. And then we’re doing online marketing banners, shooting banners that go up on the website, that go out on email blasts, trying to do things in a more editorial way, so you’re not just getting “woman in a dress against white or against cream or against blue.”</p>
<p><strong>GH: </strong>We’re trying to take the perception of a catalogue that everybody has in their head and turn it into something that feels more authentic and is interesting to look at. There are differences with magazines, where you have your editorial pages and your ad pages. And what we’re doing, it’s all one thing. So you’re taking the best of both worlds and combining it into one thing. They’re mostly direct mail; for spring fashion, we did two different books, and they each printed at least 250,000 each, but then there were smaller versions of each of those, and those were like 750,000. So it’s going to a lot of homes. That’s a pretty big circulation, if you’re thinking in terms of magazines. Especially these days. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Where do you start when working on a catalogue?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GH: </strong>The fashion department at Lord &amp; Taylor is amazing. Stephanie Solomon and Malory Wheaton, they have an amazing eye, and they’re curating these stories in the same way that a magazine does. We have our own stylist, and she’ll go to Lord &amp; Taylor for six days and prepare and pull it all together. </p>
<p><strong>GH: </strong>When we start putting together a book, we’re looking at the clothes first, seeing what kind of stories we have, putting the stories together and approaching it in a very editorial way. So we’re looking at a cohesive fashion story with a point of view. Then we pull [clothes] together with the models and the photographer, choosing photographers that we feel will really highlight the clothes and make them look amazing, whether it’s studio or location.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Which photographers are you working with?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RF: </strong>On Lord &amp; Taylor, for still life, we’ve been working with <a href="http://billdiodato.com/">Bill Diodato</a> and <a href="http://www.plamenpetkov.com/">Plamen Petkov</a>. On-figure we work with <a href="http://www.jasonkim.com/">Jason Kim</a> and <a href="http://www.patricshawbeauty.com/">Patric Shaw</a>. We brought them here. We both have a lot of experience with editorial photographers, and we wanted to bring that to Totem. Geraldine worked with Patric at <em>Glamour</em>, and I did a project at <em>Self </em>magazine prior to coming here, where I worked with Jason. </p>
<p><strong>GH:</strong> Jason’s work is so beautiful, and he really brings such an energy to the set. The studio just becomes this amazing environment for the models to move in the clothes and to really highlight them in a way that feels like it’s telling more of a fashion story. The models feel like they own those looks, they feel like those looks are an extension of their style. The direction that I work with Jason is “movement.” The model doesn’t always have to be looking into the camera making direct eye contact in a traditional pose. We’ve done things where we’ve had models running across the cyc, jumping, leaping, flipping their hair, spinning…so the clothes are still the hero, and being highlighted in the most favorable way.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: You guys have a studio in your space, and you share a building with <a href="http://www.dunestudiosnyc.com/">Dune Studios</a>. Do you shoot a lot in-house? What’s it like working in that building?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RF:</strong> It’s partly done in-house. Some studio stuff we do here, but we do 50 percent location, 50 percent studio. Anything studio, unless it requires some restrictions, we shoot it here, either down here [in Totem’s space] or upstairs [at Dune Studios]. All the merch arrives into Totem’s studio, and we go through it, look at it and take the looks into consideration. We have producers, art buyers, art directors, designers and production assistants for shoots, too. But we usually hire the photographer’s assistants, their team. It’s a combination of Andy Warhol’s Factory and a standard ad agency, because we have that “everything happens inside” kind of feel. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: So there’s a “Factory” vibe inside, but what do you look for on location?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GH: </strong>With Patric Shaw, we did a number of locations. We shot in the meatpacking district, we shot in Joshua Tree…we’re looking at the clothes and looking at what kind of environment is going to tell a good story. Going out and location scouting with Patric, he has a great eye and a great way of looking at angles and structure that really make an interesting story and beautiful pictures and make the clothes feel like as if they’re just an extension of that space. There’s an authenticity to it. It never feels like those clothes don’t belong in that space. </p>
<p><strong>GH:</strong> We’ll be shooting out west on location for an upcoming story, but we’re going to be shooting the still lifes—the boots, the shoes, the jewelry—in the studio. We want to get the feel of the environment, so I’m working with Bill [Diodato] to find sand that feels like the environment that we’re going to shoot in. We’re not importing sand, but we’re pulling different samples, and we’re gonna shoot the jewelry in that.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you find new photographers to work with?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RF: </strong>It might sound naive, but Instagram. Through relationships with other photographers, I see other work that inspires me. I follow a lot of professional photographers on Instagram, and you’ll see them touting other people’s work, you look at who the likes are, and it’s always other photographers. You see this whole network...the tribe...creatives that are really doing interesting stuff. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What’s in store for the future with Lord &amp; Taylor and Totem?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RF: </strong>We’re doing a re-branding, which is a complete overhaul. Everything. That process has been really intriguing. We’re getting their fall and spring ad campaigns, too. So it’s getting bigger. And that’s basically through the base product, which is the catalogue.</p>
<p><strong>GH: </strong>We’re just now concepting the Fall book, which I’m very excited about, because it’s going to be a bigger book, a hundred pages perfect bound, so it really will feel magazine-like. But I would love to do more beauty. We do beauty still life here, but we don’t do on-figure. I do think we could do some amazing on-figure beauty stories and beauty books where you’re doing product and figure. It just brings a bit more accessibility to the whole experience. Here are the products, but here’s how you can incorporate them into your life. You may know how it looks but you may not necessarily know what to do with it. And here we are showing you...they’re gorgeous, and you’re gonna look great in it.</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<strong>CLIENT:</strong> Leo Burnett, Troy, Michigan
<p><strong>ART DIRECTOR, PRINT:</strong> Julie Swartz</p>
<p><strong>ART DIRECTOR, DIGITAL: </strong>Mat Balcer</p>
<p>In the course of a 12-day shoot in 11 locations for an online and print campaign for Chevrolet City Express vans, <a href="http://www.westphalphotography.com/">David Westphal</a> captured both stills and video of the van being used in a variety of ways. In each scenario, Westphal had to photograph the van, the backgrounds and talent to provide sufficient coverage for each element to be composited in post. Shooting both interiors and exteriors and mixing strobes with the bright sunlight of Southern California, he had to make sure the shadows and highlights in each element were consistent so the final composites looked believable to the viewer. </p>
<p>To capture multiple images as well as video footage in a short time frame, Westphal divided his crew up so that they would work on two setups at once; as soon as he was done capturing a set of stills, he could then step onto another set nearby, capture video, and then shoot more stills from the same angle with the same lights. Anticipating that clients would soon be asking him to juggle both still and video shooting, three years ago he did a test shoot “to see how they could work together, the issues that could come up, and how to address them to create a successful workflow.” Having shot print campaigns that accompany commercials, he had observed many video crews, “and I saw how the integration [of still and video production] did or didn’t work.” </p>
<p><strong>LOGISTICS </strong></p>
<p>The goal was to show the van in use by a variety of small businesses. Westphal prepared a treatment suggesting some scenarios he would shoot. Among the traditional users of a heavy-duty van, he suggested featuring a plumber and a contractor. “Then thinking about relevance and demographics, I considered some nontraditional companies that people think of,” such as a bakery and a bike shop. “The treatment is like the audition,” he says. Once he landed the gig, he had two weeks to choose locations and work out a schedule for capturing all the assets the client wanted. “We had everything locked down two days before the shoot,” Westphal recalls. “That speaks volumes about having a good crew.”</p>
<p>Westphal likes to work with assistants and lighting technicians who are equally comfortable on still or video shoots. “I want them to know how I shoot stills. We can get things done quicker if they know what I’ll ask for,” he says, adding, “it’s critical that I know they can cross over and work on the video side.” While he had one gaffer devoted solely to lighting the video shots, most of the assistants would work on setting up whatever shot was next on the schedule. </p>
<p>To depict a baker using the van to make a cupcake delivery, Westphal planned to capture a “beauty shot” of the vehicle in front of the bakery, with the baker and her customer chatting nearby. While he worked on those shots, the prop stylist and some assistants were busy inside the store, setting up lights and the video camera. Once he had all the shots of the exterior he needed, Westphal stepped inside to shoot video of the baker scooping pastry into a bag. Then, placing his still camera nearby, he captured stills of the scene using the same lighting setup. </p>
<p>At the end of each shoot day, Westphal would meet with crew, “so we would know what we had to do the next day.” </p>
<p><strong>LIGHTING</strong></p>
<p>When planning an outdoor shot of a vehicle, he says, “The first consideration is the relationship of the sun to the background. I know that 7:45 is when the sun will pop through the trees and rake across the building,” he recalls. He set up his camera an hour and a half prior to be ready for optimal sunlight, and locked it into position on a tripod.</p>
<p>To illuminate the bakery window, his crew set up a Profoto 7b with a 7-inch dish inside the bakery, that was fired at a 6 x 6-foot muslin hung vertically on stands. Fired at 1200 w/s, this bounced light, Westphal says, was there “adding a hint of value, so [the window] didn’t look dead.”</p>
<p>Once the client had approved his shots of the fa&ccedil;ade, Westphal had the vehicle driven into position. “I’m looking at what the reflections are doing to the vehicle, and I’m looking at what the sun will look like in an hour,” as it rises in the sky and casts slightly different shadows around the vehicle. Westphal placed two 4 x 4-foot shiny boards, which are silver on one side, near the van. “We just wanted to add some value on the shadow side of the sheet metal to supplement the sun,” he explains. For the next 45 minutes, as the sun moved and he captured the vehicle in the changing light, the shiny boards were turned on their swivel arms, moved along the length of the vehicle or lowered closer to the ground, providing fill as needed. </p>
<p>The last step was bringing in the models, who stood near the rear doors of the vehicle. “The fill light for talent was a double-bounce fill,” Westphal notes. They bounced a strobe into a V- flat made of foamcore, which reflected the light through a silk that was hanging vertically near the models.  </p>
<p>Westphal estimates that he captured all his coverage of the car in under two hours. “That’s why the sun is so important,” he notes. “You have to rely on the sun to do a lot of work for you so you can be efficient in this type of photography.”</p>
<p>He then stepped into the bakery and checked his crew’s video setup, and shot the store owner across the counter, while the window was visible in the background. When the video was done, he set up his still camera and tripod to capture a patron in the shop. The strobe, set about 10 feet high at camera left, was again used to shine through the vertical muslin. On the right, he had a Magnum dish with opal glass set higher than the strobe, angling down.  </p>
<p><strong>CAMERA</strong></p>
<p>Westphal shot stills with an Alpa 12Max and a Schneider Alpa Apo-Helvetar 5.6/60 lens. “The Alpa provided me a way to get an image that is rather large in pixel dimension,” and also helped him correct perspective on architectural elements, Westphal says. “This is in addition to providing framing that fits nicely with the various online applications like banners that are typically long and narrow.” He shot tethered, which allowed the art director and Westphal’s digital tech to check the images—and approve them—quickly. For video, he used a Sony XDCam 200. </p>
<p><strong>POST PRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>Most of the editing was done “on the fly,” with Westphal’s digital tech noting which shots the art director approved during the shoot. </p>
<p>On a job like this, where the client would be responsible for the compositing, Westphal says, “I try to provide TIFF files that have minimal clipping on both shadows and highlights as well as a histogram that has a nice shape that reflects the lighting of the scene. I give the files a slight look—whether it be warmer or cooler depending on the project and individual shots.” </p>
<p>When he is collaborating with the retoucher directly, he says, he’ll typically deliver RAW files. “I try to make a clean, neutral file that provides them as much data as possible without clipping.”</p>
<p>Westphal says that shooting stills in anticipation of what a retoucher might need to make a successful composite is comparable to shooting video in anticipation of what an editor will need during post. “I always make sure that I have plenty of coverage—of the foreground, the background, the talent in the scene—in case the client wants to add something in the postproduction editing.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Advertising clients like Motorola, Roxy, and T-Mobile hire <a href="http://www.christarenee.com/">Christa Renee</a> to capture natural, outdoorsy lifestyle imagery, usually at a beach, on a boat, or on a remote hiking trail. In preparing to shoot on location, she relies on a “go to” bag that’s always packed with the gear she needs to shoot under any conditions. “I have a long, large bag and I never really change what’s in there,” she says. “It’s always two Scrim Jims, two California Sun Bounces, a tripod, some fly away sand bags, some road rags, a bathing suit, a towel, some more trash bags, tape, [and] a mini furniture pad”—a seat cushion Renee uses when she doesn’t want to sit on the floor; an assistant cut the cushion in half and re-sewed it to make it easier to travel with. 
<p>Renee typically shoots in available light, using the 6 x 6 Scrim Jims or the California Sun Bounces to modify it. “They are small enough to travel with and big enough to actually help,” she explains. As a backup, she brings a Profoto 7b with batteries and an extra head. “You never know when it will be raining or awful out and that shoot that you had planned to do in sunlight outdoors now is suddenly inside a house in the middle of an island and there is nowhere to rent equipment.” </p>
<p>In her camera bag, she carries two Canon EOS 5D Mark IIIs, and 24–70mm, 100mm macro and 70-200mm lenses. “Then depending on what I’m shooting and where, I will add lenses from there, like a 35mm or a 50mm.” She brings other necessities: a Sekonic light meter (“I’m old school, have to have it,” she says), a Contax T3, rolls of film, extra batteries, lens wipes, that little air rocket for dust, a small flash (“It changes which one I bring,” depending on what she’s shooting), trash bags (“I feel like you always need them for something, usually not for trash, but for covering stuff up or dust control or water control.”), and an Epi Pen (“I am always in different countries in strange remote places with no medical,” she explains.) Renee’s 9-year-old daughter always puts a note in her mother’s camera bag. </p>
<p>When shooting swimwear or sports campaigns on a boat, Renee has to prepare for a lot of moisture on her gear. “Models and people that don’t handle the cameras and computers really don’t give much thought to how much water they are getting everywhere when they are getting in or out, or changing suits,” she says. “We just make sure to always have a ton of things to dry stuff off with, a ton of things to wipe lenses off with, lots of plastic bags, lots of extra everything because everything gets wet, including me and my camera.” After any shoot that takes place on the water, she sends her cameras in for a cleaning. She recently received a note from Canon asking her to stop submerging her cameras in liquid, “which I thought was funny” she says. “Maybe other people are shooting differently but I really like to get in where the action is, and my cameras take a beating for that.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Fear and religious conservatism defined the culture of Utah during the 1980s. Photographer <a href="http://http://www.stevesmithphotography.net/">Steven B. Smith</a>, then a college kid pursuing a bachelor of fine arts degree at Utah State University, couldn’t wait to get out. “I was feeling angry and repressed,” he recalls.
<p>After studying and responding to the work of Robert Frank and, especially, Garry Winogrand, Smith turned his camera on the surroundings that stifled him. “To me [Winogrand] was someone who really cared about our [American] culture and also was really disappointed in it,” Smith says. Winogrand “pointed out our foibles” but did so from a self-effacing perspective, he adds. “That seemed like the perfect way to deal with the conflict I had about the place I grew up.”</p>
<p>Smith wondered: “How do I care about something and also criticize it at the same time?” The answer was to make black-and-white street photographs of gatherings of Utahns.</p>
<p>Smith’s new monograph, <em><a href="http://tisbooks.pub/products/waiting-out-the-latter-days">Waiting Out the Latter Days</a></em> (TIS Books), collects this early work, which he made in the late 1980s. It also incorporates images he made in Utah in 2013 and 2014. Smith mixes the recent images into the edit thematically, so they interact with the older work. The book is about places in time; about change and its absence; about growing up; and about how a photographer’s perspective can shift with age and experience.</p>
<p>Many of the images depict people attending and participating in fairs, parades and church services. Two small boys sit in the trunk of a compact sedan while a marching band passes behind them. Three tall, lean blonde women with nearly identical haircuts shield their eyes from the sun. A family of eight stands with their hands over their hearts observing something we can’t see. Often Smith’s subjects are looking—looking beyond the photographer, at one another, into the sky.</p>
<p>The towns in which Smith made this work are, he says, predominantly Mormon. The book’s title and several of the photographs hint subtly at the presence of the Church of Latter Day Saints. Smith’s short, unsigned text at the book’s beginning also maps the landscape in which the subjects of the photos lived: “The Cold War was escalating, the Russians were going to attack soon, and we had better stop touching ourselves,” went the Sunday school lesson.</p>
<p>Smith pays close attention to boys and young men, “projecting onto them about the struggle of growing up” in general, and specifically about doing so in “this complicated and oppressive culture.” Boys are the only people who occasionally appear isolated in Smith’s images. In one picture a teenager sits in his car observing a tiny boy trying impossibly to push another car. A boy on a bicycle watches as a young man flirts in a park with a street portraitist who is drawing his picture. In the shadow of a convenience store at the base of a pair of mountain peaks, a boy lays back on the hood of a car, chugging soda from a bottle. </p>
<p>While in his earlier work Smith was “trying to create a portrait—or a self-portrait—of growing up in Utah,” the more recent work, he says, was an investigation of his younger self that also revealed “how I, as a person, had changed,” he says. “I’m not as angry or as disappointed, and I just wanted to see what that would look like in terms of making photographs.”</p>
<p>Smith used some of the ’80s photographs to apply to Yale, where he earned his MFA in 1989, but after a crit, in which he endured his “first stern dose of criticism,” he abandoned the work—and street photography. (How disappointing it must have been for a young Smith to finally escape the culture that stifled him, only to endure more scolding.)</p>
<p>Five years ago, Smith, who is now a photography professor at Rhode Island School of Design with a Guggenheim fellowship and a CDS/Honickman First Book Prize among his recognitions, showed some of the images during a talk. A former student, Nelson Chan, was in the audience, and after the lecture he told Smith he wanted to publish the work. They kept in touch, and Smith’s book is the first monograph published by Chan and his partners in TIS Books, Tim Carpenter and Carl Wooley. Working on the book gave Smith an opportunity to “go back in time and investigate what could have happened if I’d kept working as a street photographer.”</p>
<p>Smith says he “had a blast” scanning and editing the work. It had been 25 years since he made it, and a decade since he’d seriously looked at it. “It’s important to get some distance from your work to be able to edit it well,” he says.</p>
<p>While he could recall his younger, angrier self, the book doesn’t reflect that photographer. “The more I’ve experienced my struggles in life, the more understanding I am of people that I might not agree with,” he says. “There’s always going to be a conflict personally with where I grew up because I think it’s such a beautiful and nice place to live, but part of the reason it’s such a nice place is that it’s so overtly conservative, and as a human being I couldn’t stand to actually live there.”</p>
<p>Still, Smith spends a couple of months there every year, he says. “Maybe it’s this perfect situation for being able to continually investigate the myth of one’s youth.”</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<em><a href="http://www.maryellenmark.com/">Mary Ellen Mark</a>, the pioneering photojournalist who died May 25, inspired legions of photographers who never met her. Her portraiture and intimate, probing documentary work on the lives of the poor and the marginalized expanded the world’s view of what photography can accomplish. </em>
<p><em>She also influenced many people who had worked closely with her. A week after her death, we asked a few of her colleagues to share their remembrances of Mark. </em></p>
<p>I first met Mary Ellen when she applied to join Magnum, the international photographers’ co-op. Mary Ellen and her pictures were a perfect fit: as elegant as Inge Morath and as intrepid a journalist as Eve Arnold. We’ve been friends ever since.</p>
<p>Mary Ellen considered herself a portraitist, but her pictures were not just of the famous. She wanted her work to count, to be about important things in our world, things we should pay attention to. Ultimately, I think her prime theme was the situation for women in our tired old world: Ward 81, a woman’s ward in an asylum; girl prostitutes in Bombay; Tiny (a lifelong project), a homeless child/woman, Mother Theresa; the Indian circuses; the high-school proms. All talk about life and death in our world, with women as the prime focus.</p>
<p>Mary Ellen was physically brave. Covering the 1968 convention in Chicago, by day she was in the midst of the police breaking up the protesters then, at night, elegantly dressed on the convention floor being leered at by the male delegates.</p>
<p>A week or so ago, we were talking and she said she hated the current academic style of over-Photoshopped perfection: “life without the zits and pimples,” she said. For herself, she wanted to run into the wall, to die working. Sadly she did.</p>
<p><em>—Charles Harbutt, photographer</em></p>
<p>Mary Ellen had a genuine and profound interest in people. She always asked many questions and loved listening to people&acute;s stories. Wherever she could, she would connect people with what they needed. It was natural for her to serve those around her. Her generosity always impressed me. I had the privilege of working with her for years in Mexico and I know that she deeply impacted the life of many people. She was a loyal friend. Her relationships spanned years and were real.  She demanded a lot, and gave even more.</p>
<p><em>—Selma Fernandez Richter, photographer</em></p>
<p>I was working with Mary Ellen on a book about her teaching (part of Aperture’s Photography Workshop Series) over the last year and a half. I went to her workshops in Oaxaca, Mexico, and New York, and also met her about once a week for several months. There was a day where we talked about the 1987 <em>LIFE </em>magazine story on poverty focused on the Damm family. It was moving to hear her talk firsthand about how she made those pictures and about how much her subjects impacted her life. As we were wrapping up, Mary Ellen said that after shooting a story like that she had a very low tolerance for bullshit and superficiality. Her subjects were not superficial. They hadn’t had all the lucky breaks in life and they had a story to tell; they deserved to be seen. It became the best part of the book.</p>
<p>Mary Ellen completed all the work in the weeks before she died on the workshop book and also on <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mary-Ellen-Mark-Streetwise-Revisited/dp/1597112623">Tiny: Streetwise Revisited</a></em>, which she made with my colleague Melissa Harris. I’m so sad that she did not get to see the printed books and more so that she’s gone, but so thankful that we finished them while she was alive so that others can see them. That mattered more to her.</p>
<p><em>—Denise Wolff, Photobook Editor, The Aperture Foundation</em></p>
<p>Mary Ellen was definitely my biggest influence. She was so courageous in the subject matter she unflinchingly documented, bringing a beauty and honesty to difficult and often dark subjects. I had the pleasure of working with her briefly, first as an intern in college and then as an assistant right out of school. She had an intensity and determination that allowed her to get the shot she needed, but was able to do so in a sensitive manner. It’s an incredibly difficult line to walk and something that I’m continually trying to get better at.</p>
<p><em>—Christaan Felber, photographer</em></p>
<p>When I was a junior in college, I was assigned Streetwise for an applied fieldwork class in anthropology—both the book and the film by her husband Martin Bell. I was amazed by the directness; the incredible storytelling; the obvious care for the subjects evidenced in that work. I was so struck that I began volunteering—and photographing—at a homeless center in downtown Cincinnati. That book led me to pay attention to <em>Aperture </em>magazine, Aperture books…and to the internship program, which is where I got my start. That Aperture, with editor Melissa Harris and designer Yolanda Cuomo’s guidance—and in close collaboration with Mary Ellen and Martin—was able to complete the updated edition of <em>Streetwise</em> (<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mary-Ellen-Mark-Streetwise-Revisited/dp/1597112623">Tiny: Streetwise Revisited</a></em>, forthcoming September 2015) prior to her passing, is tremendously gratifying and meaningful to me personally—and I hope a lasting tribute to her incredible tenacity and ability to capture an individual’s life and story on film. </p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[“In the mountains, a lot of times speed is safety,” says filmmaker, photographer and professional climber <a href="http://www.renanozturk.com/">Renan Ozturk</a>. His work documenting expeditions for clients like <em>National Geographic</em> and The North Face requires that he juggle the intense physical and psychological demands of climbing with the desire to push forward the style and substance of expedition filmmaking. The pro climbers who invite him on their expeditions “put up with me and [my] whole junk show of gear” in part, he says, because they believe he will help make their climbs successful.
<p>Ozturk focuses on reducing weight and increasing speed when building his expedition setup. This photo [above] shows his gear for a two-month trip to Burma, where he joined mountaineer Hilaree O’Neill and other climbers in an attempt to summit Hkakabo Razi carrying a specific type of GPS device that would determine if the peak is in fact Southeast Asia’s highest. At Telluride Mountain Film Festival in May, Ozturk screened the film of the expedition that he and Taylor Rees directed, <a href="http://www.mountainfilm.org/media/down-to-nothing">“Down to Nothing.”</a> It won the Cinematography Award.</p>
<p>The trip required a weeks-long hike through remote jungle. Burma has minimal infrastructure for mountaineering; the team had to rely on inexperienced porters to help transport their gear, and much of what they brought was shed during the weeks of travel to reduce weight. “It was a question of: ‘Are you going to bring this lens or are you going to bring the food that’s going to sustain you on the mountain?’” Ozturk recalls.</p>
<p>To capture the footage, Ozturk packed a carbon fiber RED Dragon; a Sony A7s; a Canon EOS 5D Mark III for timelapse; and a handful of GoPro cameras. Ozturk also brought a set of Zeiss CP.2 prime lenses.</p>
<p>To add variety to his shots, Ozturk packed a Syrp Magic Carpet slider and Lite Pro Feather Camera Crane. The crane “only weighs a couple of pounds and you can break it all down into a single carbon fiber pole and throw it in your backpack,” Ozturk explains.</p>
<p>He also packed a DJI drone, which he eventually lost in the jungle and couldn’t retrieve for fear of snakes. He was able to buy another drone off a Japanese crew that he met on the trail, then lost that too. Still, he says, “we came away with some incredible shots.”</p>
<p><em>National Geographic</em>, which funded the expedition along with The North Face, asked Ozturk to take over their Instagram, to which he posted throughout the trip using a satellite modem and an iPhone. He used the A7s’s Wi-Fi feature to transfer images to the iPhone.</p>
<p>For recharging, Ozturk has a Goal Zero Yeti battery, which was rebuilt for him using lightweight lithium rather than the standard nickel metal-hydride. A pair of solar panels fed the battery, but sun was hard to come by in the dense jungle, he says.</p>
<p>Ozturk eventually stripped the RED camera of its handle and monitor. The jungle humidity destroyed the latter, forcing Ozturk to shoot blind, transfer his shots to his laptop, then adjust his settings and reshoot. He ditched the RED Dragon in a bamboo hut at one point, but went back for it. Shooting the 6K Dragon, he says, “feels like you’re pushing the boundaries of the style and quality of what’s been shot on such explorations.”</p>
<p>Humidity also claimed his CalDigit RAID hard drives. “I’ve tested this stuff in Nepal at altitude,” he says, but the jungle conditions were unique. “At 13,000 feet we had all the spinning drives go down.” They had the first three quarters of the expedition on the drives. They stashed them in a hut and Ozturk shot the remainder on a 512GB SanDisk solid state drive. Luckily they were able to retrieve the spinning drives, and they eventually fired back up. </p>
<p>As the climbers ascended towards the summit of Hkakabo Razi, Ozturk was shooting with the A7s, “which is really becoming the new 5D for a lot of this stuff because it’s still full-frame, it’s half the weight, you’ve got the time-lapse intervalometer built into [its] internal app, and it’s so incredible for low light.”</p>
<p>He also used GoPros, customized so the batteries can be carried inside a jacket to keep them warm at altitude. Even with all the stunning footage he captured, he notes with a laugh, a “shitty” wide-angle GoPro shot of a tense moment between O’Neill and another climber, Mark Jenkins, was “probably the most compelling of the whole film.” </p>
<p>“You always want to roll during those moments that seem like you’re the biggest asshole ever for filming,” he says, “but in the end those are the most important moments for the story.”</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[“In my line of work, there’s always a sense of rush,” says surf photographer and filmmaker <a href="http://www.danielrussophotography.com/">Daniel Russo</a>. Reacting to surf conditions means hitting the road quickly with gear bags that can be lugged through airports and on lengthy boat rides in places like Fiji or Tahiti with “water splashing everywhere.”
<p>On assignments for clients like Vans, Sony and Patagonia, Russo spends a lot of time in the water working with his Nikon D4 and RED Epic cameras, interchanging his Nikon lenses between the two. He carries two water housings, including a custom housing for the RED that includes a port that will accommodate his 14–24mm f/2.8 lens. This lens allows him to get underwater/above water split images with minimal distortion.</p>
<p>Russo’s clients are often looking for a combination of still images and video work. And while he might leave his RED camera at home on certain assignments that don’t require video, he’s never left his still cameras at home.</p>
<p>Russo’s film cameras, which include a Yashica T4, a Minolta Panoramic and a Canon Demi EE17 half-frame camera, are an essential part of his kit—for personal reasons, for clients’ catalogue and marketing needs, and for magazines. “There is definitely a wide variety of usage for the film photos,” Russo says. The EE17, he adds, allows him to envision and shoot a layout as it might appear in a catalogue or magazine on a single frame.</p>
<p>The NIKONOS all-weather film camera, which Russo uses on land as well as in the water on account of its quality glass, comes with him for personal images made during downtime. “If I have time to go swim around somewhere, I like to take that,” he explains.</p>
<p>Russo also shoots and edits photos and video with his iPhone, often sharing travel images or short videos with his clients in real-time, or on his own social media channels.</p>
<p>Clients also often need audio commentary from the surfers they sponsor, Russo says, and that content generally sounds better when it’s captured casually during downtime rather than in more formal interviews. For that, Russo packs a Zoom H4 audio recorder. “I try to pick up audio when people are just relaxing and hanging out,” he says.</p>
<p>Generally all of his gear fits in a single Pelican case and backpack. “A lot of times I’ll be swimming for hours everyday for a few days,” Russo says. “It’s a lot of stress on your body if you’ve got a lot of gear.”</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.rachelpapo.com/homeschooled1.html">“Homeschooled,”</a> a new series by Israeli-American photographer <a href="http://www.rachelpapo.com/">Rachel Papo</a>, is a quiet meditation on the home education movement, a growing practice in the United States. But while much of the discussion around the subject tends to revolve around parents and their beliefs, Papo’s work focuses firmly on the lives and routines of a group of 15 homeschooled children living in New York’s Catskill Mountains. They are a disparate bunch: babyfaced True, with her long hair and rosary; Morgan, clutching a microscope in one image and Thor’s hammer in the next; tiny Grisha and Anastasia enticing a squirrel from behind a window; the playful farmboy Roan bundled in a cowboy’s fringed jacket and coonskin cap, alongside his big sister Iris, whose aloof gaze reminds us that homeschooled or not, teenagers are teenagers. 
<p>Papo moved to the Catskills in the fall of 2010, her husband and five-month-old daughter in tow. The young family had fled New York City in search of a slower pace, and room to find new bearings. “After my daughter, Zohar, was born I went through some hard times adjusting to my new life as a mother. I very soon came to realize that it would take me a lot longer than ‘a few months’ to find a balance between work and motherhood,” Papo explains. “Moving to upstate New York was a relief at the time.” </p>
<p>They settled in Woodstock, and soon found their place in the small town. It was then that Papo first heard of the home education movement, through a new acquaintance who was homeschooling her five-year-old child. Intrigued, Papo asked the mother for permission to photograph the young girl. Photographs of other homeschooled children soon followed, as Papo found more subjects through word-of-mouth in the tight-knit community. </p>
<p>At first, she saw the project as a wider series of portraits that could illuminate some commonality between the children. But as the work progressed, two things became clear: “The children were all so different than one another in so many ways that a common thread would be impossible to detect, and, after photographing one child, I just wanted to spend more time with them,” Papo recalls. </p>
<p>Her approach was simple: To capture the days of these children who were not trapped at desks, surrounded by classmates or furnished with scheduled activities. Her dreamlike pictures speak to afternoons lost in her subjects’ worlds; warm wood-paneled rooms, snowy forests and fecund backyards. For some of the kids, their education was as much about exploring the natural world as it was concerned with textbook learning. Papo says the children were uninhibited in front of the camera. As they went about their days, she would occasionally ask them to pause so she could make a picture when she found something interesting.</p>
<p>Papo followed their journeys of discovery as she was treading her own new ground artistically, having set aside a longtime devotion to the medium of film to shoot her first digital project. It was not a decision she made lightly, but the economics were undeniable. “The world moves forward, you have to move with it,” she says. “In the end, the image is what’s important, not my emotional connection to film.”</p>
<p>Abandoning her Mamiya 645 for a Canon EOS 5D Mark II, she sought to work on overcast days and in soft light in order to replicate the “painterly” aspect of her film work. One luxury of this project was that she often had anywhere from several hours to days to spend with her subjects.</p>
<p>Growing up in Israel, Papo was, by her own description, a “shy and lonely” child. She had three much older brothers and often felt removed from the family dynamic. By the time she was an adolescent, her siblings had already moved out of the house and she spent much of her time alone. Discussing “Homeschooled,” she acknowledges that this project—and in some ways, all of her work—is an interrogation of those “sensitive years” and their complicated legacies.</p>
<p>In her editing process, Papo works alone on her early edits, always revisiting work to pull out images that went unseen on an earlier pass. Only then does she share a loose edit with friends and colleagues before sitting down with a curator to create a specific exhibit. In the case of “Homeschooled,” this last and crucial step was done in partnership with Ariel Shanberg, executive director of the <a href="http://www.cpw.org/">Center for Photography at Woodstock</a>, which exhibited the work this spring. “While my approach to the editing process was artistic and emotional, his was objective and logical,” Papo explains. </p>
<p>Papo estimates that she photographed 15 families (some didn’t make the cut for the exhibition) but feels like she could have shot many more. The project’s completion was spurred by the family’s April, 2013 move to Germany, where Papo now resides. </p>
<p>The move, decided upon in late 2012, provided her with the urgency to finish “Homeschooled,” shooting more in the last six months of her time in Woodstock than she had in the previous year and a half. </p>
<p>Papo plans to publish a book of the work. “I need to spend more time with the pictures. I literally shot until the night I left for Berlin, seven months pregnant, and now I have a baby,” she says, adding that she hopes next year will be more productive because her 20-month-old will be going to nursery school. “That’s why I don’t homeschool,” she laughs. “I respect the parents who do it, I just don’t know how they do it!”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[As we were working on our annual <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/PDN-July-2015-The-Fine-Art-Photography-Issue-14052.shtml">Fine-Art Photography Issue,</a> photo gallerists, publishers, curators and artists from around the world were gathering at two big art fairs: <a href="http://www.aipad.com/?page=PhotographyShow">The AIPAD Photography Show New York</a>, organized by the Association of International Photography Art Dealers, and <a href="http://www.parisphoto.com/losangeles">Paris Photo LA</a>, which the organizers of the long-standing art fair in Paris have been bringing to the back lot at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles since 2013. These fairs give collectors, photographers, curators and editors insights into the fine-art market and an opportunity to view new work.&nbsp;
<p>We asked an attendee of both fairs, Michelle Dunn Marsh, what stood out to her. Marsh is the founder of <a href="http://minormattersbooks.com/">Minor Matters Books</a> and executive director of <a href="http://pcnw.org/">Photographic Center Northwest in Seattle</a>, and was one of the judges of The Curator competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“One of the most striking booths I saw at Paris Photo LA was that of Seattle-based [gallerist] <a href="http://marianeibrahim.com/">Mariane Ibrahim-Lenhardt</a>, featuring the work of <a href="http://www.kimiko.fr/">Kimiko Yoshida</a>,” says Marsh. “‘The Brides’—a series of self-portraits that are mysterious, luscious, and cross generational and cultural borders—made an impact on me when I saw them last fall in Seattle, and they were, if possible, even more distinctive among the vast array of work on display at Paramount Studios.”</p>
<p>In the series, the Tokyo-born artist photographs herself in bridal dress adapted from different cultures and traditions. Her exhibition at Ibrahim’s M.I.A. Gallery in Seattle last year was titled “Something Blue.” The title plays on the proverb about a bride needing to wear “something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue” for good luck on her wedding day, and on Yoshida’s monochromatic compositions in which she, the subject, almost disappears into the background. This year, she has shown her work at the Vitraria Glass +A Museum in Venice, Italy, and she will have a solo show at the International Photo Festival in Kyoto.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yoshida, who divides her time between Tokyo, Venice and Paris, is one of many international artists Ibrahim-Lenhardt has shown in Seattle since 2013. Says Marsh, “Over the last two years I have been consistently impressed with Mariane Ibrahim-Lenhardt’s gallery program. A recent transplant to Seattle from France, she has infused the art scene here with a new worldview through powerful exhibitions by contemporary photographic artists such as Yoshida, Maimouna Guerresi, Fabrice Monteiro and Scarlett Coten, among many others. The Seattle Art Museum and Los Angeles County Museum of Art are just two of the many institutions acquiring the work of artists she champions.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<a href="http://mattalbertsphotography.com/">Matt Alberts</a> had big plans for a trip down the West Coast with his portable wet-plate studio—a 1973 Airstream land yacht—to continue <a href="http://thelifersproject.com/">his “LIFERS” project</a>, a series of portraits of people “who eat, sleep and breathe skateboarding just because they love it.” He had just finished a trip around the south and east, mounting pop-up shows at skate shops along the way. But his truck and trailer were stuck in New York, where his money had run out. 
<p>Then he learned through a social media connection that Cadillac was loaning vehicles to brand ambassadors. So he contacted <a href="http://fleishmanhillard.com/">Fleishman-Hillard</a>, the automaker’s PR firm, to ask for support. “I figured getting a vehicle sponsor would make it so much easier to do what I’m doing,” Alberts says.</p>
<p>He had called at the right time, with the right project, and ended up with a year-long sponsorship. It included funding for three month-long road trips, with an assignment to produce “The Seasons Collection.” Alberts describes it as “a multimedia photography collection of adventure-sports-driven stories about people who push the limits in pursuit of their passion.” They include surfers, mountain bikers and skiers, in addition to skateboarders.</p>
<p>The project is currently under way. While making wet-plate portraits of subjects he finds along the way who have made a lifestyle of their passion for a sport, Alberts is documenting his travels for social media using digital photography and video cameras. He will also mount three exhibitions of his wet-plate photographs.</p>
<p>When Alberts pitched the project, Cadillac executives saw how it could dovetail with <a href="http://www.dare-greatly.com/">Cadillac’s then-new “Dare Greatly” campaign</a>. The campaign is an attempt to revive the struggling brand by associating Cadillac with artists, activists and others who are challenging the status quo. </p>
<p>“We really admired what Matt was doing, and the network he created,” says Eneuri Acosta, Cadillac’s Lifestyle and Luxury Communications Manager. “We’re looking for new avenues to talk to new customers and new demographics in a way that’s credible. Matt gave us the opportunity to do that. What he was doing lined up perfectly with what we envisioned Cadillac to be doing in the photography space. We’ve always thought we can speak to that particular audience credibly because Cadillac has had influence over pop culture over the years.”</p>
<p>Of course, Alberts is challenging the status quo of photography by embracing a fussy, expensive 19th century photographic process. Six or seven years into a successful career as a wedding photographer, he says, “I just couldn’t sit in front of my computer anymore.”</p>
<p>In early 2013 he took a course with Denver photographer <a href="http://studioq.com/">Quinn Jacobson</a>, a master of the wet-plate process. “I was immediately hooked,” says Alberts. He decided to combine it with his passion for skateboarding, and make portraits that challenged the stereotype of skateboarders as ne’er-do-wells. Wet-plate photography gives him a way of “seeing right under the skin. You’re able to capture the soul, and see the real person inside,” he explains.</p>
<p>By chance, he met Chet Childress at an event in Denver, and asked the skateboarding legend to pose for a portrait. “I made three images of Chet on black glass,” and the “LIFERS” project was born, Alberts says. </p>
<p>He bought an 11 x 14 Chamonix view camera, some antique lenses, and the Airstream. His first road trip was along Route 66 from Colorado to California, supported in part by an Indiegogo fundraiser and “a little bit of backing” from Red Bull and Pabst Blue Ribbon, two clients for whom he’s shot events. Accompanying Alberts were Childress, Joe Fernandez and Coburn Huff—all skaters with extensive connections in the skating community.</p>
<p>“We shot a whole bunch of legendary skaters,” Alberts says. Back in Denver, he mounted an exhibit. “We had an awesome party, but I didn’t sell enough prints to even break even on the framing.” He was $10,000 in debt.</p>
<p>He shot a couple of weddings to get himself through the winter. Then, with $4,000 from a skate community benefactor, he took another road trip through Nebraska, Missouri and Arkansas, then up to Philadelphia, where he parked the Airstream in his parents’ yard. Along the way, Alberts mounted a series of pop-up shows at skate shops. “I sold some prints, got us more gas money, and kept us going,” he says, explaining that the project was never about the money, but about doing what he loved. </p>
<p>Alberts eventually made his way to New York, where he “made portraits of legendary old-school New York skateboarders.” Among those he traveled with was skater Nate Fantasia, who is sponsored by <a href="https://www.mightyhealthy.com/">Mighty Healthy</a>, a skate clothing line. Alberts ended up photographing Mighty Healthy owner Ray Mate. “He posted a picture of a Cadillac on Instagram, and I said, ‘What’s up with that?’”</p>
<p>That’s how Alberts learned of Cadillac’s brand ambassador program. “They’re trying to get influential social media people into their vehicles” to talk the brand up to followers, Alberts says. He wanted a vehicle for the next leg of the “LIFERS” project, from Portland to L.A., so he made a pitch.</p>
<p>“I put together a plan to do a month-long skate trip called Northwest Passage,” he says. The 18-page document described Alberts’ social media following for “LIFERS,” the press the project had received and a summary of the costs. “It answered the questions: What have we done, where have we been, and what are we trying to do,” Alberts says. He also produced a video re-capping the Route 66 trip, to demonstrate his video production skills. </p>
<p>“I pitched this one-month trip, and they said, ‘How about if we make it a year?’” Alberts says. The automaker also asked him to expand the scope of the project beyond skateboarding, to include a broader spectrum of adventure sports. </p>
<p>Acosta says Alberts’ ability to document the journey for social media was essential. But the photographer’s social media following—which is small—was less important. Acosta explains that Cadillac planned to use its own social media channels, and expected the project to get social media traction through the networks of adventure-sports athletes that would be featured in the project. </p>
<p>Alberts says it took seven months of discussions to nail down all the details of the project, which were finally spelled out in a 20-page contract. He isn’t discussing the budget details, but says that in addition to providing two vehicles for the road trips, Cadillac is paying travel expenses, including gas costs and some hotel expenses. (The crew will sleep in the Airstream and camp out most nights.) Alberts hinted that his fee was modest, covering his debt for the “LIFERS” project to date, but not much more. “I’m just about breaking even, but I have cool art, exposure and awesome experience.”</p>
<p>Alberts and his crew completed the first trip in March; it focused on skiers and snowboarders. A private exhibition of wet plate images from the trip was held in April in L.A. The second and third trips were scheduled for May and August. Alberts is chronicling the trips on Tumblr (<a href="http://thelifersproject.tumblr.com/">thelifersproject.tumblr.com/</a>) and Instagram (<a href="https://instagram.com/thelifersproject/">@thelifersproject</a>). Videos are being archived on the project’s website (<a href="http://thelifersproject.com/">thelifersproject.com</a>) as well as on YouTube.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[In 1975, photographer Ansel Adams and University of Arizona president John Schaefer established the <a href="http://www.creativephotography.org/">Center for Creative Photography</a> (CCP) on the university’s campus in Tucson. Unique for its time, the CCP was chiefly concerned with acquiring the archives of masters like Adams, Wynn Bullock, Harry Callahan, Lola Alvarez Bravo and many others. A lot has changed in photography, and in how museums present images, since then. In April 2014, when <a href="http://www.creativephotography.org/exhibitions-events/events/center-creative-photography-appoints-joshua-chuang-chief-curator">Joshua Chuang</a> joined the CCP as chief curator from Yale University Art Gallery, he was tasked with shaping the future of one of the medium’s most important museums. In May of this year, CCP’s 40th, <em>PDN</em> spoke with Chuang about his first year at the museum, about what we can expect from the programming there, what kinds of photos he wants to acquire and how he plans to present the work of contemporary photographers.
<p><strong><em>Photo District News</em>: You’re a little over a year into your tenure there. What’s been most interesting for you thus far?</strong></p>
<p>Joshua Chuang: Before I came here I had some basic familiarity with the collections. What I’ve tried to do is become more intimately familiar with them, thinking that I could make some headway in a year. And in fact this is going to be a long endeavor, because the collections are so deep, so rich and so relatively untapped.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Have you found anything particularly exciting or surprising?</strong></p>
<p>JC: There are the things people know about: We’ve got the Ansel Adams archive, we’ve got Wynn Bullock and Harry Callahan and Aaron Siskind and Frederick Sommer. But maybe not that many people know that one of the early acquisitions of contemporary photography was the original set of prints from Larry Sultan and Mike Mandel’s “Evidence.” We’ve got the archive of that project—all the letters they wrote to the various companies and archives to get access. We have the history behind these objects and the context. For instance, before the CCP acquired the show, Mike Mandel and Larry Sultan had debuted this body of work at SFMOMA, and it was their choice to present the works as artifacts, so they were simply sandwiched between glass and pinned to the wall. No frame, no mat; they were meant to be understood as art objects. When the CCP acquired the work it agreed to keep the [exhibition] tour going. Here at CCP, everything was properly matted and framed. The next venue after CCP was Harvard, the Fogg Museum, whose curator said yes to taking the show on the basis of seeing it at SFMOMA. So when he got the crates he was really chagrinned because he expected to see what he saw at SFMOMA. There’s a whole series of correspondence between him and the CCP about how the CCP just totally ruined the conceptual conceit of the work by framing it. There’s letters from Mike Mandel and Larry Sultan in there, too. Those are the stories that you don’t typically get at a museum that might just have a portfolio of work. You get the original flashpoints around the body of work. You’re able to see what was at stake at that time and are able to use that information to think about the work anew. It’s not just what we have in the collection, it’s this larger sweeping context, a fabric if you will, that you can weave about an entire scene, an entire generation of photographic activity.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Who is the CCP audience? Is it the general public, or do you draw a more specialized viewer?</strong></p>
<p>JC: For the whole history of the CCP we have not charged admission, and typically museums use admission or membership to learn more about their audiences. I’m new here, and I’m still learning who our core audiences are. There are the obvious constituents like the MFA photography students here on campus, and the various groups of photographers and photography clubs that come and see our exhibitions. But I think that your audience constantly evolves. Before I came here the CCP hadn’t had a full-time curator for its collection in place for a number of years. I don’t think there was necessarily a cohesive vision for the kinds of exhibitions to expect from the CCP. That sort of thing can effect your audience too, and their expectations, so I see my job as resetting those expectations and reaching out again to our audiences and finding out more about what they like, what they don’t like, what more we can do. In a sense we’re starting again.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What should audiences look forward to from CCP programming?</strong></p>
<p>JC: When I first came on board we had a fairly blank slate in terms of exhibitions. What I thought I would do was to, for the first four exhibitions, create a kind of menu or primer for the kinds of things that we might be able to expect from the CCP going forward. The first show, which was actually already on the books when I came on board, was called “<a href="http://www.creativephotography.org/exhibitions-events/exhibitions/performance">Performance</a>.” These were contemporary photographs from the Douglas Nielsen collection. Doug Nielsen is one of the most prominent collectors of photography in Tucson, and a very well respected modern dance professor here on campus. We pretty much just emptied out his loft, and he brought his dance classes in to respond to the work as part of their assignments. There was a cross-disciplinary engagement there, [and we demonstrated] that [the CCP] can collaborate and start conversations with some unexpected partners.</p>
<p>The first show that I conceived is called “<a href="http://www.creativephotography.org/exhibitions-events/exhibitions/astronomical-photographs-our-solar-system-and-beyond">Astronomical: Photographs of Our Solar System and Beyond</a>.” I knew coming in that one of the strongest academic units here on campus is the science department. In fact, there’s a unit here called the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory that is instrumental in helping NASA develop its space exploration. I would go so far as to say that without this unit, NASA wouldn’t have accomplished nearly as much. One of the things that I found out when I got here is that NASA actually has one of its image archives right here on campus. They’ve given the U of A, a complete set of vintage Lunar Orbiter pictures. So [I] quickly put together an exhibition that I’m really quite proud of. We were able to reach out to the scientists and there have been astronomers all over the region who’ve been coming to see the show. [It’s] certainly not a strictly fine-art photography exhibition, but that’s one of the messages I wanted to send.</p>
<p>This year is the CCP’s 40th anniversary. My colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/rebeccasenf">Becky Senf</a> and I are co-organizing a 40th anniversary exhibition. It’s been a wonderful excuse to really dig into, not only the collections, but into some of the stories behind the collections. We’ve issued invitations to former [CCP] directors, curators and archivists, to ask them to choose a print or a suite of prints to include in the exhibition, and also to write the wall text and some kind of anecdote about why this piece is important to [him or her]. When the collection started to take form in the mid-70s to the early 80s, there was incredible excitement in the field, because it was really unique in the world at that point. And now of course you have other institutions that are starting to collect archives and starting to collect photography in great depth. But the things that came in those first several years are amazing, because there was a concerted effort on the part of the entire field to enrich this place.</p>
<p>The next show after that is going to be a monographic, Lee Friedlander Western landscape exhibition. In the early 1990s, he turned to the square format, the Hasselblad Superwide, and he stuck with that for the next 25 years. He’s no longer using it, but it became the dominant form of his work and really changed the look and feel of his work. He started using that camera right here in Tucson; he was photographing the Sonoran desert, so we thought it was fitting to look [again] at that whole body of work here. That’s a sampler of the kinds of exhibitions that we hope to do here going forward.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Have you started acquiring work?</strong></p>
<p>JC: Yes. We’re chiefly in the business of acquiring archives. It’s not as easy, clean or straightforward as going to a commercial gallery and buying a print. It’s a series of negotiations and relationship management, and sometimes it takes years to finalize these negotiations. But we have been making discrete purchases of works that aren’t part of larger archives. My emphasis for the past year has really been on conceptual work. Not necessarily because it’s a particular favorite area of mine—it is—but because the Center really doesn’t have very much of that material. That Larry Sultan–Mike Mandel “Evidence” body of work is an exception in our holdings. I would say the majority of the work here is classical, fine-art photography (I don’t think contemporary photographers even use that term anymore). Of course now is also a time to look at conceptual work, because you can still find good values, and you can’t find good values in things that are already established. That’s been my focus. So just to name a few things: We acquired a suite of unique works by <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/news/In-Memoriam-Ray-K--11820.shtml">Ray Metzker</a>, who recently passed away, and on the other end of the spectrum we acquired a diptych by <a href="http://www.mattlipps.com/">Matt Lipps</a>, a San Francisco-based contemporary artist.</p>
<p>We’re doing a summer show for the first time in a while. It’s focused on the work of three contemporary photographers: <a href="http://www.lucasblalock.com/">Lucas Blalock</a>, <a href="http://www.aperture.org/blog/interview-with-owen-kydd/">Owen Kydd</a> and <a href="http://www.johnlehr.net/">John Lehr</a>. The title, <a href="http://www.creativephotography.org/exhibitions-events/exhibitions/pure-products">“The Pure Products of America Go Crazy”</a> is taken from a William Carlos Williams poem written in 1923. It’s going to be a visual conversation between their bodies of work, but I’m spiking that conversation with about a dozen objects from the collection—old-school things, quite unexpected. If you can imagine it’s like a movie credit line, it would be Owen, Lucas and John being the headline stars, but also featuring works by Ansel Adams, Brett Weston, Harry Callahan, Frederick Sommer, Charles Sheeler, Paul Outerbridge, Jan Groover—people like that.</p>
<p>I’m going to be acquiring at least a work each [from Blalock, Kydd and Lehr] because I think that it’s really important for the CCP not just to add strength to strength, but to extend the scope of its collection to address what’s being produced now.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>:  Why did you choose Blalock, Lehr and Kydd for this exhibition?</strong></p>
<p>JC: Of this generation of the, quote unquote, new American photographers, the work of these three artists stands out. The meaning of their work goes beyond the means used to make the final works. Process is certainly an important part of their work, but I think that each of them have gotten beyond that to deal with real meaning. The other thing that they have in common, and this is the reason for this overarching title, is that they each deal with an aspect of American retail or consumer culture.</p>
<p>Lucas is photographing things he gets from the dollar store, cast-off things from junk shops, really cheap materials that don’t usually get the kind of large-format-camera scrutiny. He’s applying pressure that way and really playing around with that mismatch. He’s able to create, for me, some quite insightful work not just about photography, but about our culture and society. Owen is largely looking at storefronts, things in storefronts, so we’re going to be focusing on that particular aspect of his work. And John is looking at disused, boarded-up shops and surfaces that have a kind of palimpsest aspect to them. All of them have totally embraced the digital, but know that their work needs to be about more than just the digital. And I think that they’re doing it each in different ways.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>:  By “beyond process,” do you mean that they reach beyond the contemporary concern of “What is a photograph?”</strong></p>
<p>JC: That’s right. As a museum person, I’m thinking about the now, but I’m also thinking about the future. How is this work going to resonate 15, 20, 50 years from now? If you are another kind of institution like a Kunsthalle and you don’t have a collection and you’re trying to put together shows that resonate under current circumstances, you’re perhaps not thinking so much about these other questions. But since we're a collecting institution and we’re trying to create ties in-between what has happened and what is happening, I would hope that any work that I feature in this prominent a way could stand up to that scrutiny over time.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How is the work of the contemporary photographers going to be in dialogue with the work of masters like Callahan and Friedlander and Siskind?</strong></p>
<p>JC: It’s going to be this iterative, back and forth visual conversation between [the contemporary photographers’] work, and I’m going to punctuate those conversations with these older voices; but it will not be the expected sort of thing. For instance, Ansel Adams: I’ve never seen it published before, but it’s a still life that he did as a young photographer. It actually looks very contemporary; it’s got a glass bottle, a triangular rule of some sort. There’s a string running through it. It’s a collection of objects and it looks kind of like a Lucas Blalock. The Westons, Brett and Edward, were incredibly interested in surfaces and in objects that have surfaces, and so I think it’s a chance to put their work in a new light. Because often when you see their work it is in the context of their own work. It doesn’t often have the chance to dialogue with what’s going now, so I’m hoping that this interaction helps both parties—the old and the new.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What’s exciting to you about presenting photography to contemporary audiences?</strong></p>
<p>JC: If art is good, it’s really fulfilling and it shouldn’t be that difficult to make it matter. I think that that’s really the job. The job is to make whatever it is that you believe in, and that you see quality in, relevant. Whether it’s something from the 19th century or even something totally obscure from the mid-twentieth century. If the seeds of the object or the work’s relevancy are there, if I could play some part in planting them, cultivating them, helping them to grow, I’ll feel I’ve made some sort of contribution to the field. That’s the crux of the job.<br />

    <article_text><![CDATA[<strong>Client: </strong>Nike
<p><strong>Art Director: </strong>Andre Simmons</p>
<p>For about ten years, clients like Nike, Puma, Speedo and <em>ESPN the Magazine</em> have been hiring <a href="http://www.carlosserrao.com/">Carlos Serrao</a> to capture action. He and his crew are used to finding creative solutions to technical and logistical challenges, particularly when they involve professional athletes or Olympic competitors who can spare only a few minutes for a shoot. Clients who know him and his long-time crew “know that we like to experiment,” he says. “A lot of what we do involves technical lighting, color, motion.” </p>
<p>A job shooting the fall/winter line of <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/sportswear/tech-pack">Nike Tech Pack</a> sportswear required him to shoot movements, but presented few constraints. “That division [of Nike] has more leeway to be fashionable and experimental,” Serrao explains. The challenge was not about locations or scheduling, but how to make the sportswear look interesting. “The fun part is solving not the logistics, but: How do we light this? How do we shoot this?” he says. “These types of jobs are basically dream jobs.”</p>
<p>The art director on the shoot, Andre Simmons of Nike, first worked with Serrao in 2004 and has hired him many times since. In describing the look he wanted, he referenced some of Serrao’s recent fashion assignments, some thermal imaging, and one of Serrao’s earliest sports ad campaigns in which he added “an element of red color to demonstrate the heat and speed of [the athlete’s] musculature,” Serrao recalls. He would do something similar with the Tech Pack images, using red tones “to symbolize the heat that was retained or expelled by the apparel,” contrasting it with a bluish tone on the models and clothes. </p>
<p>Simmons wanted the models to pose with the jackets both zipped up and unzipped to show the lining. Says Serrao, “We thought it would be fun to do that as multiple exposures. You can do it in post, but I wanted to experiment with doing it in camera.”</p>
<p><strong>Logistics</strong></p>
<p>The shoot took place at Siren Studios in Los Angeles, on a cyclorama wide enough to give the models room to move. Serrao suggested one model he had worked with before because her movements in front of the camera were fluid and graceful. For the male model, Serrao’s studio manager did a small casting session. “I like to meet them in person,” Serrao says. “I ask, ‘What sport did you play in college?’” </p>
<p>Some of Serrao’s crew members, including his chief lighting technician, Ron Loepp, have been working with him for ten years on both his still and video shoots. While film crews often have rigidly defined roles, on Serrao’s sets, he says, “They wear many hats.” He’ll typically show them references to explain the look he’s after, and they all work on lights and gear to make it happen. </p>
<p><strong>Lighting</strong></p>
<p>Serrao wanted to illuminate a large area of the cyc in which the models would be free to move around while he shot from different angles. “I like to use an overall wash of light from above,” he says, “so often what we’ll do is put a framed 20 x 20-foot silk above the set and shine a strobe head through that.” Though Serrao no longer recalls whether he and Loepp used Profoto or Broncolor strobes on the shoot, he knows he needed short flash duration and fast recycling time to freeze the models’ movements. “For me what works is to put a bi-tube head into a single power pack. It provides more power, and speeds up the flash duration.” By adding a CTB gel to the overhead light, Serrao says, he was able to get a “subtle blue tone” in the highlights. </p>
<p>To light the back wall of the cyc, which was about 12 feet from the model, he and his crew placed two strobes just behind the models and out of the frame, positioned at a 45 degree angle. On the grids, Serrao used theatrical blue gels, for a deeper, more saturated blue tone.</p>
<p>For frontal lighting on the models, he set up grids about waist- or chest-high to the model; on these he used deep red gels. He experimented to get the right output. “You have to turn the power down so it doesn’t become the keylight or the brightest light there,” he adds. “With the gel on it, you have to be careful—if you go too bright it’ll go pink, but if you go too low it won’t show.” Once he had the palette he wanted, he worked with his digital tech, Damon Loble, to create a color profile to work with while previewing shots on the set. </p>
<p>About getting the multiple exposures, Serrao says, “It’s an old strobe trick.” He popped the strobe, then moved the camera or had the model get into a new position while the lights were out, popped the strobes again, then did it a third time to capture the model in another pose. Between pops of the strobe, Serrao says, “I’m moving the camera a little bit, so I’m capturing him in different parts of the frame.” He slowed the shutter speed to two to three seconds, giving the model time to zip or unzip the jacket. </p>
<p>He notes, “We were trying to get as fast a flash duration as possible, so we shot between 1/1600th and 1/2000th,” which allowed him to freeze the action. Serrao says that he’s used to being very precise about the output on each of his light sources when he needs to freeze motion on an athlete—say, a basketball player going for a jump shot or a sprinter coming out of the starting blocks—in order to eliminate any motion blur. On the Tech Pack shots, however, the models’ movements were slower, and “we had more leeway.” </p>
<p><strong>Camera</strong></p>
<p>Serrao used a Nikon D800 with an 85mm prime lens, and an 105mm to capture small stitching details on the apparel. </p>
<p>Serrao recalls, “We were shooting at maybe ISO 400 to 800, and maybe f/8 or maybe f/5.6.” </p>
<p>Serrao always shoots handheld to follow the action, and likes to shoot fast, which worked well because the client wanted many variations and lots of material. Serrao was pleased with how his in-camera multiple exposure experiment worked. “When it comes up on a monitor, it’s a surprise for everyone,” he says. While he knew a retoucher would work on most of the shots, he says, the in-camera multiple exposures provided a useful reference for how they should look. “The retoucher knows it has to have a certain organic quality.”</p>
<p><strong>PostProduction</strong></p>
<p>“I usually like to look through my favorites,” Serrao says, but on this shoot, Simmons had wanted to bring back a lot of variations to show other creatives. An edit “would have taken weeks,” Serrao says. So instead of waiting for an edit, Simmons left with a hard drive, and Nike handled the retouching. </p>
<p>On a typical shoot, Serrao likes to arrange his selected images in groups, “to let you see the narrative of the story or an overview of the shoot.” When he sends his selects or a rough edit of a video, he labels his work because he knows it’ll be passed around the client’s office. “We’ll do our own edit with credits, my name, my partner’s name. Then you’ll hear from someone else at the agency that you haven’t heard from in a while saying, ‘I’ve just seen that thing you did.’”</p>

According to Sigma, this construction minimizes chromatic aberration during magnification especially in the edge of the image field. By placing aspherical elements in the rear of the lens, Sigma said it was able to improve performance when shooting wide open, keeping distortion, flare and chromatic aberration to a minimum. A full-time manual focusing mechanism lets you switch into manual focusing during autofocus by rotating the lens ring. It’s sold in Canon (EF) and Nikon (F) mounts.</div>

The series mates Alpa’s lenses with Phase One’s new IQ2 A-series digital camera back. The big difference from the existing IQ back is that the three Alpa lenses for the system have been specially calibrated and profiled for the back. After the lens is attached and selected in the back’s menu, lens corrections are automatically processed when importing photos into Capture One Pro 8.1/2. The 70mm Alpa HR delivers an aperture range from f/5.6–32 and can focus on objects as close as 31.5 inches from the lens.</div>

<div><strong>Rokinon Cine DS 50mm T1.5 AS UMC</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://adorama.evyy.net/c/124294/51926/1036?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2FRKDSC50MMFT.html">This manual-focus prime lens for full-frame cameras</a> is capable of focusing on objects as close as 17.7-inches away. It features a de-clicked aperture for smooth operation during filming. The aperture is calibrated in the more accurate t-stops—not f-stops—as is standard with cinema lenses. You’ll enjoy an aperture range from T1.5 wide open down to T22. All lenses in the Cine DS family are color-matched by Rokinon so they’ll provide consistent color reproduction across focal lengths. They also share a common design with the focus and aperture rings in identical positions so you won’t have to reposition a follow focus when changing lenses. The aperture and lens rings have industry standard gearings to fit follow-focus accessories and focus distance and t-stop scale markings are duplicated on either side of the barrel. It’s sold in Canon EF and Nikon F mounts, as well as Sony A and E mounts.</div>

    <article_text><![CDATA[If you’ve been to a portfolio review, you’ve probably seen photographers with successful commercial and editorial careers sharing their personal work with curators and gallerists. For myriad reasons, many photographers who first established themselves by shooting assignment work want to build fine-art careers.
<p>While there are several examples of commercial and editorial photographers who’ve also shown and sold their work in galleries, it’s more common to see “artists” doing commercial work. And the path to a career that balances both art and commerce is elusive. While they aren’t as entrenched as they once were, biases in the art world against photographers with commercial backgrounds persist. “The quote unquote art world can be full of very snooty, elitist people,” notes gallerist <a href="http://www.peterfetterman.com/">Peter Fetterman</a>.</p>
<p>“There are some galleries that won’t take on an artist that has a commercial component to their career; it’s just something they can’t see past,” says Sarah Hasted of <a href="http://www.hastedkraeutler.com/">Hasted Kraeutler Gallery</a>.</p>
<p>But aspiring fine-art photographers shouldn’t let those biases deter them, several gallerists and photographers tell <em>PDN</em>. On the contrary, commercial careers can actually benefit aspiring fine-art photographers in a number of ways: by providing them income and the financial means to produce personal work; and by affording them opportunities to develop their craft. Many gallerists are open to representing photographers with commercial and editorial careers, and value their skills and experience.</p>
<p>“I think a lot of commercial and editorial photographers think that [all] gallerists are opposed to representing them based on that decision they’ve made [to build a commercial career],” Hasted says, “but that’s really not the case.”</p>
<p>“It’s of no concern to me the backstory or the history of the photographer,” states Fetterman. “It’s about whether the photographer has created something special.”</p>
<p>The first and most important step for a photographer breaking into the fine-art market is to create original work that interest gallerists and their clients. </p>
<p><a href="http://andyfreeberg.com/">Andy Freeberg</a> began his career as an editorial photographer and has spent the past eight years building a fine-art practice. He recalls speaking with a photo editor friend several years ago as he contemplated doing fine-art work. “‘Andy, do you know any magazine photographer that has ever become an art photographer?’” the friend asked. “We couldn’t really come up with anybody,” Freeberg recalls.</p>
<p>When Freeberg first took his personal work—black-and-white street photographs—to the Houston <a href="http://home.fotofest.org/">Fotofest</a> portfolio reviews, “people liked it, but it wasn’t going to get to the next level,” he recalls. Freeberg did learn something, however. He saw the work of photographers who “got picked up” he says. “You really need to have something unique.”</p>
<p>Freeberg observed something else in Houston that was encouraging: “If you have something [great], there are people here who are interested.... These are people that are really passionate about photography and they want to see what’s out there.”</p>
<p>A couple of years later, Freeberg started to photograph the desks and gallery assistants at the entrances of art galleries because he “thought it was funny.” He showed a few of the images to his photo editor friend, who told him he was onto something. The “Sentry” images depict the white, tall front desks in major art galleries. Behind the desks the viewer can just make out the tops of the heads of the gallery workers who tend them. The work pokes fun at the unapproachability of the art world.</p>
<p>Through contacts he’d made at Fotofest, he showed the work to gallerists in New York; J&ouml;rg Colberg shared the work on <a href="http://www.jmcolberg.com/weblog/">Conscientious</a>, his photography website; then gallerist <a href="http://www.danzigergallery.com/exhibitions">James Danziger</a> reached out and said he wanted to exhibit Freeberg’s photographs.</p>
<p>One show does not a career make, however. Freeberg recalls that despite good press and interest in the work from curators and collectors, “They were like, ‘Who is this guy?’ They weren’t ready to buy.” Feeling the need to quickly come up with another body of work to build on his first, Freeberg went to Russia and created “Guardians,” a series that depicts women who monitor galleries in Russian museums. He’s since followed that with a series depicting gallerists in their booths at art fairs. “It’s now eight years since I had that [first] show in New York and I’m just getting to the point where I feel like I can do this full-time,” Freeberg says.</p>
<p>Lack of time can be a problem for commercial and editorial photographers interested in creating fine-art projects: “It is like having two careers,” Freeberg says.</p>
<p>Though she had studied art at the Rhode Island School of Design and interned at Pace/MacGill gallery, early in her career <a href="http://www.jillgreenberg.com/">Jill Greenberg</a> chose to build her commercial career “so that I could support myself,” she recalls. “I really wanted to do both,” she says, but felt she needed “to make a decision.” As her commercial career grew, it trumped her personal work. “I was working nights and weekends to establish myself as a commercial photographer,” she says. “It is sort of hard to do both.”</p>
<p>Commercial success eventually afforded Greenberg the resources to do the personal work that established her as a fine-art photographer. One of her first solo exhibitions, “Monkey Portraits,” opened in 2004 at <a href="http://kopeikingallery.com/">Kopeikin Gallery</a> in Los Angeles. “I wouldn’t have been able to do the [portraits of] monkeys or the bears or the horses if I didn’t have a commercial career,” she says. “Those are really expensive shoots.”</p>
<p><a href="http://clampart.com/">Brian Paul Clamp</a>, who shows Greenberg’s work in New York, says he likes “that an artist may be doing commercial work” for a number of reasons. “If they’re a successful photographer, it helps financially to fuel their fine art,” Clamp says. Commercial work also helps get the photographer’s name out there, and “takes a little pressure off me not being their sole source of income,” he adds.</p>
<p>Technical ability and professionalism are other benefits commercial and editorial photographers can bring to their fine-art work. “[Assignment work] makes them more knowledgeable about lighting, it makes them more knowledgeable about color palette and it in a lot of ways makes them more professional when you’re working with them,” explains Hasted.</p>
<p>Because she is “used to getting a lot done in a day,” Greenberg says, “I’ll work really hard when I’m my own boss…because that day is on me. If I’m spending $30,000 to do a shoot, I am going to make sure I get lots of pictures.”</p>
<p>“Being able to make work on tight deadlines forced me to think about how to make my artwork better,” says <a href="http://www.kevincooley.net/">Kevin Cooley</a>, who simultaneously built art and editorial careers after he graduated from the School of Visual Arts in 2000. “When you’re sent somewhere you have to make a picture no matter what the context is…. That is a skill that I think as an artist is pretty hard to obtain.”</p>
<p>Thanks to editorial assignments, Cooley also was able to travel on his clients’ dime and make personal work while on location. He also learned how to work as hard on his personal work as he does on his work for clients. “There’d be lots of time where I’d say to myself, ‘Why don’t I always treat my own artwork as seriously as I would treat the assignment?’ That sort of discipline really benefitted my artwork.”</p>
<p>As Cooley’s career has grown, his assignment work has often been “based on my artwork,” he says. For instance, Avinor—the Norwegian airport authority—hired him to create work based on his “Nachtfluge” series of long-exposure images that show commercial airline flight patterns at night.</p>
<p>Many commercial photographers make the mistake of thinking they have to create art that is completely unlike their assignment work. “They have this expectation of what people going into a gallery want to see, and the truth is, what people going into a gallery want to see is an artist’s voice and their vision,” Hasted says. “It’s when they’re trying too hard that is comes across as insincere or inauthentic.”</p>
<p>“If I see another image of a nude on a rock, I’m going to throw up,” Fetterman says. </p>
<p>Hasted points out that <a href="http://www.erwinolaf.com/360_waiting/">Erwin Olaf</a>, one of the artists she represents, has “always had a successful commercial career, but they always look like Erwin Olaf photographs.” Collectors have even requested to buy certain of his commercial images, she says.</p>
<p><a href="http://martinschoeller.com/">Martin Schoeller</a>, another of the artists Hasted represents, has also found a home in the fine-art world. Some of the first work he showed was close-up portraits of celebrities he made for himself while shooting magazine assignments. “Martin has a unique way of seeing,” Hasted says. “I don’t think people hold it against him that he has taken these great editorial images of these famous people. I think they embrace it with certain artists.”</p>
<p>Hasted admits that “some” collectors and curators may still look down on photographers with successful commercial careers, but, Fetterman notes, “real collectors want to collect what moves them, whether it comes from Madison Avenue or Timbuktu.”</p>
<p>The reality is that commercial and editorial photographers who want to build fine-art careers don’t face a more difficult road than any other aspiring artist. But “scoring big success in the fine-art world is like going to Vegas,” Fetterman says. “You may win or you may not win.”</p>
<p>“[Great work] can come from left field,” he adds. “What keeps all of us engaged in this field involved and excited [is the idea] that we’re going to find the new, great, original voice. And it can happen.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Though it may seem counter-intuitive, it can be less expensive for a collector or curator to commission an artist to create a new photograph than to walk into a gallery and purchase an existing image. Of course that depends a lot on who the client is, what they want the artist to create, and how they plan to use the commissioned artwork.
<p>Joanne Cohen, the executive director and curator of the <a href="http://my.clevelandclinic.org/services/arts_medicine/art-program">Art Program at the Cleveland Clinic</a>, the nonprofit medical center, frequently commissions art in all media. The Cleveland Clinic has an art collection of more than 5,400 pieces, including major photography-based commissions by artists such as Ray Charles White, Peter Newman and <a href="http://www.regenprojects.com/artists/catherine-opie">Catherine Opie</a>. Between 2010–2011, Opie, an Ohio-born artist whose photos are in the collections of numerous museums including the Museum of Modern Art, created “Somewhere in the Middle,” a series of 22 large-format inkjet prints of photographs of Lake Erie in four seasons. The images—made for Hillcrest Hospital, one of the Cleveland Clinic’s community hospitals—maintain a consistent horizon line that runs the entire 100-foot length of the concourse of a new addition to the hospital. </p>
<p>“I could not have gone out and bought 22 photographs by Cathy Opie,” says Cohen. “It would have been cost-prohibitive. We worked out a fee for her to produce the work, plus production costs.”</p>
<p>One reason the commission she negotiated was less expensive than a straight purchase was that, rather than making the images in the series available only to the hospital, Opie editioned some of them: She made numbered prints of the images available for purchase and exhibitions. “We paid her to create the work,” says Cohen, “and she was then able to monetize it.”</p>
<p>Cohen first approached Opie through a New York gallery that no longer handles her work, but was referred to <a href="http://www.regenprojects.com/">Regen Projects</a>, Opie’s Los Angeles dealer. Regen Projects suggested Cohen negotiate the commission, the contract and the price with the artist directly.</p>
<p>Commercial photographers are used to shooting an image to the specifications of a client and negotiating a licensing fee. When a fine-art photographer is asked to shoot a particular subject for a collector or curator who wants to own a print, establishing a price is more problematic. </p>
<p>“Commissions are a little bit of an anomaly, but occasionally we do have them,” says <a href="http://www.yanceyrichardson.com/">Yancey Richardson</a>, a New York City-based photography dealer and gallerist. “It’s always very difficult to price, because it’s difficult to find out what’s expected. Generally I approach commissions in terms of whether they are good for my artists. Is it something that is interesting for them to do? Is it something that will add to their body of work?”</p>
<p>Some artists who accept commissions choose not to publicize them. As one artist contacted for this article replied while declining to be interviewed, “Honestly, I’d rather keep the commercial commissions I do—even if it’s related to my own work—separate, especially in print.”</p>
<p>Many of the artists and dealers <em>PDN</em> spoke with for this article agree with Debra Klomp Ching of <a href="http://www.klompching.com/">Klompching Gallery</a> in Brooklyn that when it comes to settling on a price for a commissioned print, “Everything is on a case-by-case basis.” (<em>Editor’s note: Klompching Gallery is co-owned by </em>PDN<em> creative director Darren Ching.</em>)</p>
<p>Ching explains, “If a client of the gallery wants to commission one of our artists, we serve as a liaison between the artist and the client. We broker the general terms and come to an agreement that both are happy with.” </p>
<p>She adds that if the commission is editioned, “that can bring the price down for the person commissioning the photograph.”</p>
<p>She cites two photographs that Seattle-based photographer <a href="http://dougkeyes.net/home.html">Doug Keyes</a> created for writer <a href="http://andrewsolomon.com/">Andrew Solomon</a>. “Andrew Solomon is a client of the gallery,” explains Ching. Solomon was interested in Keyes’s “Collective Memory” series, which consists of multiple-exposure photographs of books. “He came to an exhibition of Doug’s work, liked what he saw, and wanted to know if it was possible for Doug to make work with his two books.”</p>
<p>Keyes agreed to photograph Solomon’s <em>The Noonday Demon</em> and <em>The Irony Tower</em>, and added the images to his “Collective Memory” series. </p>
<p>He issued the prints in an edition that he sold at stepped prices—increasing as the edition sells out. Keyes says of his sale to Solomon, “To make it affordable for him, he got the first one at a tiered price. The first two or three are one price. The final two are a higher price.”</p>
<p>Keyes says he would set a higher price for the print if a commission required him to shoot something he wouldn’t normally, but in the case of the Solomon commission, “He just picked the book for me really. It was pretty easy.”</p>
<p>Philadelphia-based artist <a href="http://www.jessicatoddharper.com/">Jessica Todd Harper</a> creates intimate photographs of families and friends that explore the social and emotional nature of domestic relationships. Because her fine-art work lends itself readily to portraiture, she is frequently approached to shoot private portrait sessions. She says she can tell after talking to a potential client whether or not to take the commission.</p>
<p>“My clients appreciate art and don’t want a portrait of themselves in matching khaki pants and white shirts on the beach,” says Harper. “I’m not dissing that, but there are photographers who do that very well. They don’t need me.”</p>
<p>Her commissioned portraits of clients’ families and her photographs of her own family and friends are indistinguishable in style. A photograph of a little girl being lifted from the bath by her mother, for instance, was made for one of her collectors. It appears on Harper’s website both in the section set aside for commissioned portraits and in her series entitled <a href="http://www.jessicatoddharper.com/#at=0&amp;mi=2&amp;pt=1&amp;pi=10000&amp;s=0&amp;p=0&amp;a=1">“The Home Stage,”</a> which was exhibited at Rick Wester Fine Art in New York City last fall. </p>
<p>The image has the maternal warmth of a Mary Cassatt painting. Says Harper, “Before we were even making the portrait, they were in the bath and the light was so beautiful, I took the photograph. That was the one we used. The shoot was over before it even started.”</p>
<p>As to how she prices a commissioned photograph, Harper says that depends on the client. “I work with people in different economic situations, so I have a sliding scale,” she explains. “If someone is excited enough about my work, I try to find a way to make it work. There are no packages. It’s a very individual and a very personal process.”</p>
<p>She also considers what the client wants. “If a portrait is public, and 99 percent of the time it is, it just goes into my repertoire and gets included in exhibitions and published in books,” Harper says. “I print in editions of ten.” </p>
<p>There are exceptions, however. “Some people are very private and don’t want their pictures in public, so I make something just for them.”</p>
<p>Not being able to edition the images—or use them in promotion—changes the negotiation. “If someone wants the work to be exclusive,” says gallery owner Yancey Richardson, “you have to charge more because the artist doesn’t have the opportunity to receive the revenue from the sale of prints.”</p>
<p>When the assignment is for a commercial or editorial client, artists still need to consider whether the commissioned photo is something they can sell to collectors. </p>
<p>Richardson helped negotiate editorial assignments for Boston-based artist <a href="http://www.rachelperrywelty.com/">Rachel Perry Welty</a>. In one example, <em>Vogue </em>was interested in the artist’s “Lost in My Life” series of self-portraits in which she shows herself camouflaged or overwhelmed by the incidental clutter of consumer existence—twist ties, take-out boxes, fruit stickers, receipts. <em>Vogue</em>, however, wanted her to photograph herself in designer accessories. </p>
<p>In deciding whether to take the shoot and how to price it, Richardson and Welty considered the opportunity to work with props and stylists. The collaboration “allowed me to surround myself with the stuff of a luxury life,” Welty says, and to expand her “Lost in My Life” series with an image she couldn’t create on her own.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Visitors to <a href="http://www.lethaprojects.com/">Letha Wilson’s</a> exhibition “Sight Specific” at <a href="http://www.lightwork.org/">Light Work</a> in Syracuse can see photos she took in the canyons and deserts of the American West. But rather than transporting viewers to those wide-open spaces, Wilson’s work constantly reminds them that they are standing in an enclosed space, glimpsing only a portion of the vistas she captured. She mounted one print behind a partition she built, cutting holes in it to expose portions of the image. She hung a photo of a sunset by squeezing the edges into parallel slits she sliced into the wall, so the photo bows outward. “It does nice things with the light,” Wilson notes. “It works like a sundial.” Other prints are partially covered by pieces of drywall. Looking down, a viewer might notice a photo of lava rock that Wilson has molded around the gallery’s baseboard. 
<p>The exhibition, which Wilson created specifically for the gallery, is a study in contrasts: between the pristine landscapes she’s photographed and the manmade material she uses to distort or obscure her photos; and, Wilson says, “between the actual experience of being in these spaces and looking at these photos afterwards in a wholly different place and time.”</p>
<p>Wilson, a sculptor, has incorporated her photographs into her work since 2003, but she’s been photographing landscapes for much longer. When she was growing up in Colorado, her family would go on long camping trips and hike into the wilderness. Her dad would pass around a disposable camera. “Looking back, all our family photos are of trees and rivers. There are no people in them,” Wilson says. </p>
<p>When she attended Syracuse University, where she majored in painting and took classes in darkroom printing, and later when she moved to New York City to get her MFA in mixed media at Hunter College, she brought along her 4 x 6 snapshots. Far from the places where they were made, the photos evoked very different feelings. Wanting to “dig deeper” into that gap between the place and its representation, Wilson decided to treat the prints as sculptural elements. At first, she painted on her photos, “to abstract them.” In time, she developed a daily practice of pouring concrete and laying the shapes over her images. “I called them ‘Extrusions,’ because it was taking form from photos and extruding them out into three dimensions,” she says. </p>
<p>Working in concrete is physically demanding, but she enjoys the hands-on process. She gets a similar pleasure from printing in the darkroom—something she does almost every week. Wilson, who typically shoots with a Yashica twin-lens box camera an ex-boyfriend gave her years ago, used to scan her negatives and then have them printed, but found making her own prints was liberating. “Going into a darkroom to make a whole bunch of prints made them less precious and more portable,” she says. She also likes handling an image through every step of her process: “Because it’s mine, I can destroy it.” </p>
<p>For Wilson, bending, cutting and obscuring photos is, in part, a reaction against “the rules of photography—of which there are so many,” she says. Still, no matter how much she obscures or covers her images, each of her sculptures retains a trace of evidence that she was in those awe-inspiring places. She considered at one point using an image appropriated from the Internet, but decided against it. “I need to take those photos.” Her work is a record of her experience—both in observing the landscape, and in manipulating her representation of it later. At the same time, she values landscape photography and hopes to encourage people to reconsider the genre by showing it in a new context. “It’s become so ubiquitous through calendars, and the proliferation of landscape images used on the Internet. It gets written off as a clich&eacute;: ‘Oh, it’s a pretty landscape.’ But there’s something that makes people want to take those photos, and be in that landscape.”</p>
<p>Though she made photos in Maine while studying at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, and during artist-in-residency programs in Hawaii and the headlands of Marin County, California, Wilson frequently returns to the Western landscapes photographed by Carleton Watkins, Ansel Adams and other greats. “I like going to these places that photographers like to go—for good reason,” she says. “There’s a weird timelessness there. You feel like you’re the first person to work there, because it’s just you and the land.” </p>
<p>When Light Work director Shane Lavalette invited Wilson to exhibit, she decided to leave her concrete mixer at home and test a variety of new materials with help from the nonprofit gallery’s technicians. A Light Work staffer, for example, found a local company that could cut metal, enabling her to mount prints on aluminum that she could then have cut and folded to fit her designs. Light Work also let her redefine the exhibition space—cutting walls and pasting prints directly on the plaster and the molding. </p>
<p>After the show closes July 18, most of the work she made for the space will be peeled off the walls and destroyed. “Actually I like that,” Wilson says. “It’s nice that it’s only there in the moment. And, I don’t have to worry about storing it.” </p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.wageforwork.com/">Working Artists and the Greater Economy (W.A.G.E.)</a> is a nonprofit advocacy organization pushing for the rights of artists to be fairly compensated for their work. In October 2014, the organization introduced <a href="http://www.wageforwork.com/certification/1/about-certification">W.A.G.E. Certification</a>, a program that establishes a standardized artist fee structure that can be used by nonprofit arts institutions of all sizes, from small, artist-run gallery spaces to major museums like the Museum of Modern Art and Whitney Museum. In order for an institution to be certified, that institution must compensate artists they work with according to the pay standards and guidelines established by W.A.G.E. Fee categories include solo exhibitions, two-person exhibitions and group exhibitions; performances of existing work or new, commissioned work; film screenings; lectures, readings and other appearances; and written texts. W.A.G.E. created a calculator that determines these minimum fees using a formula that takes into account the size and annual operating budget of an organization.
<p>The introduction of W.A.G.E. Certification followed three years of planning and research by visual artists, educators, curators, sociologists, writers and others with experience and expertise in the art economy. W.A.G.E. was initially established in 2008 through a series of informal meetings in New York between artists, performing artists and independent curators. Among the core group of people leading the organization early on were artists who “had a lot of cultural capital and were always being asked to perform and exhibit but found that they were always broke. It occurred to them that it was a strange and inequitable equation,” recalls <a href="http://lisesoskolne.com/">Lise Soskolne</a>, who is presently the “core organizer” of W.A.G.E.</p>
<p><a href="http://visitcenter.org/">CENTER</a>, the Santa Fe-based nonprofit arts organization whose mission is to support photographers, is among a group of institutions currently seeking W.A.G.E. Certification. “I want artists to be clear that we’re there to support them,” says CENTER executive director Laura Pressley. Because CENTER charges entry fees for some competitions, Pressley believes that people who don’t know the organization might assume they are for-profit. Certification, she says, “would help anybody who doesn’t know CENTER understand that we are mission-based and not profit-driven.” Pressley adds that she wants to advocate for other nonprofit photography institutions to do the same. “[Paying artists] is something that the other non-profits, if they can, should move towards,” she says.</p>
<p><em>PDN</em> recently spoke with Soskolne to learn more about W.A.G.E. Certification and how the organization is working toward a “tipping point” that would see proper compensation for artists become the norm.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: It’s interesting that in the texts about Certification published on the W.A.G.E. website, the organization acknowledges that artists have played a role in the current situation. Why is it important to acknowledge that artists have contributed to the exploitation of cultural labor?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lise Soskolne:</strong> It’s important because we represent artists and we’re trying to, as it says in our manifesto, develop an environment of mutual respect between artists and institutions. All the blame for our current condition can’t be put exclusively on the shoulders of institutions, because we’re all complicit in perpetuating the myth that art is exceptional in its relationship to the market economy. There is plenty of denial among artists that art and commerce are or should be totally autonomous from one another. Artists also have a role to play in advocating on their own behalf. Because there has never been any collective bargaining in the field it’s up to individual artists to use their own agency in getting paid. I think many people would love to join a union if it were possible, but since there isn’t such a thing yet they need to be prepared to make a sacrifice by saying, “No, I’m not going to work for free.” W.A.G.E. can only do so much by certifying institutions—we also need artists to step up and help us put pressure on them.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: W.A.G.E raised more than $50,000 last year in a crowdfunding campaign, and many of the donors were artists. Why do you think so many people supported the organization?</strong></p>
<p><strong>LS:</strong> I should say first that crowdfunding as a fundraising tool is likely to have been a one-time event for us—it was a stopgap measure more than it was a strategy, but it was successful in a way that we were not expecting. Early on in the campaign we sent out an appeal that included a list of those who had donated thus far because we were genuinely moved by the generosity of our peers and proud of the support they were showing. We noticed that people seemed to give when the list went out and it became a kind of ritual throughout the campaign: watching it grow longer week-by-week and seeing who had given. Wanting one’s support to be visible was a way to join with one’s peers in solidarity; in this case it was in support of W.A.G.E. as an entity and potentially as a representative. Not to overstate things, but it looked and felt like coalition building, or at least something more than just a fundraising campaign. Our community showed genuine support and love for W.A.G.E. by getting behind our work and our goals.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: As you’ve spoken with nonprofit arts organizations, have they expressed concerns over any particular requirements for W.A.G.E. Certification?</strong></p>
<p><strong>LS: </strong>At the beginning there was one organization that just couldn’t understand the importance of a minimum wage or “compensation floor,” which is a key component of the program. I think that was an anomaly though, because I suspect that a lot of organizations are already paying fees close to the minimums we’re recommending. The primary problem has been the number of organizations contacting us to be certified but who don’t fit into the current model, which is for a visual arts presenting context. There was a magazine that wanted to be certified, there were service organizations that wanted to be certified, residency programs, so we’re currently trying to work on other fee schedules, which had always been the plan. There’s a lot more work to be done.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Should artists use W.A.G.E.’s fee calculator as a point of reference in their discussions with institutions, even if those institutions aren’t certified?</strong></p>
<p><strong>LS:</strong> Yes and they already are. I know someone who negotiated a higher fee with the Whitney Museum based on it, so it’s definitely being used by artists as a negotiating tool. It’s also being used as a guide by festivals and juried art exhibitions. In fact I noticed that the <a href="http://www.filterfestival.com/">Filter Photo Festival</a> based their stipend on our guidelines and cited W.A.G.E. in their application. Another valuable thing about the fee calculator is that institutions can use it in grant applications to ask for “X” amount of money to pay artist fees, which they’ve never been able to do before. There’s also another level to this on the grant making side: W.A.G.E. has work to do in putting pressure on funders and government agencies to hold the organizations they fund accountable for paying fees. Funders could also make grants available specifically for fee payment based on our guidelines. There have never been any guidelines or standards for artist fees before so there are a lot of uses for them.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: As part of certification, organizations can’t pay artists more than the “Maximum W.A.G.E..” which specifies that organizations with total annual operating expenses of more than $5,000,000 should not pay an artist more than the average salary of the organization’s employees. Why was it important to include a ceiling in the W.A.G.E. Certification fee schedule?</strong></p>
<p><strong>LS:</strong> It’s important that “nobody unduly profits from the redistribution of wealth—including artists.” Here I’m quoting directly from the program’s policy. To frame it that way makes absolute sense. It’s not equitable for an artist to make more than an employee of the institution.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: There are currently ten organizations that are W.A.G.E. Certified or have Certifications that are pending. What will it take to grow the list of certified organizations?</strong></p>
<p><strong>LS: </strong>I think it’s going to take building a critical mass, after which there will be a tipping point. We’re not close to that yet, but maybe when we hit 20 or 30 we will be. People are already taking it seriously because we’ve managed to certify five, but of course that’s not a huge number. Ten I think shows some consistency, 20 or 30 shows a movement of some kind. What it’s really going to take is getting a larger institution on board, like a museum. Ninety percent of the time people have been reaching out to us to get certified, which makes sense because the program is predicated on institutions self-regulating: They initiate the process because they want to be certified. But it wouldn’t hurt to start reaching out and inviting institutions to engage with us. I think that will help too.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Is the endorsement of top-tier institutions necessary to make the Certification project a success?</strong></p>
<p><strong>LS: </strong>I think it’s really important, because that’s the level at which most exploitation happens. Large institutions can use the exposure argument better than anyone can. Exhibiting at that level is fundamental to an artist’s critical and market success so it’s very easy for them to say, “Here’s this opportunity, but you don’t get a fee,” and that message gets sent all the way back down, or all the way up from the smaller institutions to the largest if there’s no floor or minimum. If there’s no minimum, there’s no place to start from, and thus nowhere to go.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Presumably it would be easier for major institutions to gain certification.</strong></p>
<p><strong>LS:</strong> You would think so, but I think at that level… they’re often not paying fees, and are very likely not paying the kinds of fees that we’re expecting them to pay based on our calculator. We did a survey of visual and performing artists in 2010 that gathered data on artists’ experiences with the payment practices of New York City nonprofits between 2005–2010, and while we didn’t gather enough data on the big museums, there is enough anecdotal evidence to indicate that artists are more likely to not get paid by the large institutions than the small ones. This is in part because most of the smaller ones were founded to support artists, which is why the institutions we’ve certified so far tend to be smaller. It’s important to them—it’s why they exist, and they want their commitment to artists to be acknowledged by their community. As institutions get larger, they have a tendency to become further removed from the reasons for their founding, or from providing support to artists, because they incur many other additional expenses. A lot of money tends to be spent on perpetuating themselves institutionally.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What are the future plans for W.A.G.E.?</strong></p>
<p><strong>LS: </strong>Plans include potentially expanding the program to include some of the categories mentioned previously, but there’s also a possibility of certifying individual artists, which is really exciting to us. We haven’t decided definitively, but it would involve certifying artists on the basis of their commitment to show either only with institutions that are W.A.G.E. Certified, or to show only on the basis of receiving fees that meet our standards. This goes back to my earlier comment about artists taking more responsibility for their role in perpetuating non-payment. They would have to be prepared to make a sacrifice and say, “I’m going to say no to this exhibition,” and certifying them on that basis would make their agency visible. If we don’t start saying “no” more collectively then change will happen more slowly. Artists have to see themselves as part of a larger community in which it’s in everyone’s interest to individually turn down unpaid offers so that everyone will get paid. As work refusal it’s not dissimilar to a strike, but because it’s not coordinated and in relation to a single employer, it may function more like a boycott. We’re thinking about both.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[In early 2014, <em><a href="http://www.maxim.com/">Maxim</a></em> was in trouble; the once-profitable lad magazine that Felix Dennis had brought over from the U.K. in the 1990s was losing millions each year and in danger of folding. Since the restaurant and real estate magnate Sardar Biglari purchased the title in March of that year, however, <em>Maxim</em> has matured. Kate Lanphear, the former style director at <em>T: The New York Times Style Magazine</em>, was brought on as editor-in-chief, and installed a new team to supervise a redesign in hopes of making <em>Maxim</em> relevant again.
<p><em>Maxim’s</em> director of photography, <a href="http://andreavolbrecht.tumblr.com/">Andrea Volbrecht</a>, has been at the magazine since 2011, and helped it transition from the loud, bright pinups it was famous for to a more natural, grown-up esthetic. Debuting with March 2015’s “Raw” issue, each month now has a single-word theme, which Lanphear and creative director Paul Martinez hope to explore as the magazine finds its new voice. Here, Volbrecht tells <em>PDN </em>about making the first three issues of the new <em>Maxim</em>, and the photographers who helped define its new look.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What’s new about <em>Maxim’s</em> approach to photography?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrea Volbrecht:</strong> I would say that the biggest difference is...things used to be very poppy, a lot more on-camera flash, really loud imagery. It was bright and very colorful throughout the whole design. Once the new owner came on, we started paring that back, and when Kate came on board and our whole new team was in place, it really came to fruition in the March issue. Our reader has grown up, so it’s about talking to him in a more grown-up way, as well. Visually, we are trying to go to a place more based in classic photography, way more natural light, wherever possible. Making the women feel super natural, very healthy, happy, alive—like women are in their natural state, versus as an object. Instead of making it feel very flash-in-the-pan, [we want] something that’s gonna hold up. Something that’s gonna be arresting, hold your gaze and make you feel something. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Who are some of the new photographers you’ve worked with, and how does their work embody the new <em>Maxim</em>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AV: </strong><a href="http://artistandagency.com/gilles-bensimon?tag=News">Gilles Bensimon</a> [who shot Candice Swanepoel for the cover of the debut issue] is definitely one of those people. We did our second cover with him as well. The thing that Gilles is so good at is he knows how to make a woman come to life. Let her be herself, comfortable in front of the camera, relaxed. He makes them look beautiful in a very natural way. There’s not piles of makeup and huge hair and tons of jewelry. Kate [Lanphear] has a history with him, so he was someone that we really wanted to collaborate with.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jamiechung.com/#recent">Jamie Chung</a> is somebody that I’ve worked with for a handful of years, and he’s just brilliant, I love collaborating with him. We shot probably three or four different versions for that “Raw” opener that he did. He’s great at pumping out ideas and being open to collaborating, so it’s wonderful to have a dialogue with someone who’s got such creative talent. He’ll continue to be a part of the book for a long time. Similarly, we knew we [needed] a gear story and really wanted to come out strong with that, so we worked with <a href="http://www.danforbes.com/">Dan Forbes</a> for our gear feature. And he’s just phenomenal, super nice, crazy talented, and lovely on top of that. </p>
<p>We’ve been really fortunate that we’ve had a lot of positive experiences with a lot of different photographers. <a href="http://www.sigurdg.com/">Sigurd Gr&uuml;nberger</a> was lovely, super sweet, incredible to work with. He made the most out of what was a freezing-cold, windy, dark, gloomy day in Malibu, and Bianca [Santos], our talent, was such a trooper, never wanted to complain, though she was shivering the whole time. </p>
<p>For fashion, <a href="http://www.nerasa.com/">Robert Nethery</a> shot our Mads Mikkelsen story in our May issue. That was the story that came in that we were like, “This is what we want <em>Maxim</em> fashion to be. He’s the kind of guy, he’s rugged, he’s masculine, he’s interesting, he’s a character.” And the light was really classic, gorgeous natural-looking light. That is the touchstone of where we’re at with our fashion.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: The boxing portraits by <a href="http://andreaslaszlokonrath.com/">Andreas Laszlo Konrath</a> seemed like a notable departure from the old <em>Maxim</em>. Had you worked with him before?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AV: </strong>No, I hadn’t, and I was so excited to work with him on that boxer story; that was one of the shining stars of the debut issue. I wish we could have given him 20 pages, because he brought back so much film that we could have done it easily. He shot the ones that we ran [in print] that were on black, but he also did similar ones on white, and he also did action shots of each of the guys, and some of those ran on the extended iPad edition.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How would you describe the book’s new esthetic? </strong></p>
<p><strong>AV:</strong> The goal has been that as you move through the book, you’d hit on different volume levels throughout. There’s going to be moments that feel way more aggressive, visually… and then there’s going to be moments that feel more reflective and quiet. It gives you a little bit more range as you look through it so you don’t feel like every single page feels the same. It’s been a really interesting transition.</p>
<p>I think the most difficult thing that any magazine has when they’re re-branding—and we’re talking about re-branding from a point where the book was really on the brink of not existing anymore, before it was bought—there’s a lot of people who haven’t picked up the magazine in a really long time. They have no idea what the content is, but it’s a brand that’s been around for so long, that there’s a built-in notion of what that thing is. And it has a lot of negative connotations, unfortunately. But there’s a great staff here that’s really committed to turning it around to being a product that men will want to pick up, that women will feel comfortable picking up and looking at, and that has more to say than just, “Oh here, look at some girls.” It’s really about a man’s lifestyle and all that encompasses: There are food, gear, travel, fashion, profiles and business stories. The biggest struggle sometimes is getting on the phone with every single agent and photographer and saying, “No no, really, the magazine wants to be different, and we would love for you to be a part of it, this is where we want to go.” We feel like we’re really off to a strong start. And there’s so much more that can be done. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Has Kate Lanphear’s name helped convince people to work with you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AV:</strong> She’s got a really strong visual eye, which has been really exciting for me as the photo director. I feel like she and I are very aligned in terms of what we like, and that helps a lot, because she’s very visual. And people are familiar with her, and that always helps when you feel like there’s someone helming a magazine that has always been committed in her career to striving for something that’s quality.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What, if anything, about the old <em>Maxim</em> has survived?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AV: </strong>I think the old magazine served its reader: Young guys that have a sense of humor and wanted some place where they could be themselves and not be judged. And that idea has carried over, for sure. We’re not trying to be the authority on everything and tell guys exactly how they have to live. We’re providing suggestions of things that we feel like they should check out. We’re trying to give them a place to feel inspired and something to aspire to. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What interests the “grown up” <em>Maxim</em> man?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AV:</strong> In terms of fashion, it used to get handled with a service approach, and for a few years, there was almost no fashion to be found anywhere in the book. And that’s a real part of men’s mags, and more and more every year, men are engaging in fashion in a way that they haven’t previously. And our readership...we haven’t actually gotten to the point where our readership is in their 40s and 50s. It’s still very much in their late 20s, 30s, young guys who are making a decent living, doing well for themselves. So we are still trying to feed those age groups, and what you’ll notice in the approach to the fashion is, it’s more about stories, or choosing a specific theme. Like a double-breasted suit, or “camel is the color for fall,” or a denim story. It’s a very specific through-line, so ideally it’s digestible for the reader. Versus being extraordinarily servicey, like, “These are the ten things you have to buy this month.” It tends to be a little more broad, so it’s easier, ideally, for people to get into and have a takeaway. We want it to be aspirational too, but we don’t want it to be so far-fetched that a guy can’t see himself realistically in it. We see the <em>Maxim</em> man as a masculine dude in America. So reaching that reader is important to us.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Scientists predict that rising sea levels will inundate significant portions of North Carolina’s Outer Banks within a century. But flooding and shifting sands are already chronic nuisances. Beach houses are falling into the sea. Deeply vested in the culture and economy, residents are arguing over what, if anything, they should be doing about it.
<p>The slow-motion crisis is the subject of a feature story titled “Slip Sliding Away” in the March/April 2015 issue of <em>Audubon</em> magazine (and <a href="http://www.audubon.org/magazine/march-april-2015/slip-sliding-away">on Audubon.org</a>). It was reported by Mac McClelland and photographed by <a href="http://www.gregkahn.com/#!/index">Greg Kahn</a>, who says the challenges for him were to build rapport with wary subjects, and bring attention to the story without sensationalizing it.</p>
<p>“What I didn’t want to do was try to make this more catastrophic than it is, because it is happening at such an incremental level that it is ignored. The idea was to show it for what it is, and the power it has,” says Kahn.</p>
<p>He got the assignment on the basis of a personal project called <a href="http://www.gregkahn.com/#!/portfolio/G00007zCTwj19qzM">“3 Millimeters,”</a> which he’s been working on since 2012. That project is a visual study of the environmental and social consequences of the three-millimeter rise in sea level each year along Maryland’s eastern shore. “Climate change is something I’m passionate about, and wholeheartedly believe in and want to tell the story of,” the photographer says.</p>
<p>Sabine Meyer, photography director for <a href="http://www.audubon.org/">National Audubon Society (NAS)</a>, had seen Kahn’s ongoing “3 Millimeters” project when she was doing research for an NAS website dedicated to climate-change issues. “I liked his approach. He’s a photojournalist, but his photography is quiet. He has a little bit of a fine-art approach. He could do portraits, he could do landscapes. The choice was really obvious,” Meyer says. </p>
<p>His assignment was to approach the four-day shoot much the same way he has shot the “3 Millimeters” project, using a combination of portraits and landscapes to tell the story. “It was kind of left up to me to find exactly what I wanted to shoot, and the kinds of stories I wanted to tell.”</p>
<p>But he had to follow the basic framework of McClelland’s story. On the basis of the people she had interviewed and places she had scouted while reporting the story, Meyer gave Kahn a short list of subjects. “I told him I wanted portraits that tell us about the person, but also about the place they live and come from,” Meyer says. “And second, we talked about how to show sea-level rise in a visually telling, compelling way so people want to look at it. Climate change is a polarizing issue. So we were navigating the question: Can you prove with a picture that this is happening, so you have visual evidence?”</p>
<p>Kahn started calling people on Meyer’s list to ask them about their activities, and probe their local knowledge in preparation for his trip.</p>
<p>“Talking to them [in advance] was crucial,” Kahn says, explaining that they gave him ideas for what to shoot. For instance, an environmental scientist who has been studying the Outer Banks for years told Kahn about the Salvo Campground Cemetery, a secluded graveyard that was slowly washing away. A photograph Kahn made of the cemetery was part of the final edit. </p>
<p>Kahn made the trip to the Outer Banks in late October, and worked from sunrise to sunset looking for images. “I travel very light. I want to be very mobile in these situations. All I took was my medium-format digital camera [Pentax 645z] and one lens [35–55mm f/4.5 AL].” He also kept a close eye on phone apps for the weather and tides, to track wind direction and times of high and low tide.</p>
<p>Kahn was looking for subtle signs of encroaching seas, rather than extreme signs that climate change skeptics could easily dismiss as abnormal or misleading. “Showing the little things—the little pieces that add up—is way more effective than going during a storm and showing dramatic images that don’t really tell what’s going on.”</p>
<p>Kahn photographed condemned beach houses, using the horizon to show how much they’ve shifted on their foundations. He showed the relentless encroachment of sand borne inland by waves. The opening image shows a backhoe scooping sand, Sisyphus-like, off a roadway. Another image shows workers shoveling mounds that threaten to bury a house.</p>
<p>Kahn also shot portraits of the main subjects of McClelland’s reporting. “I wanted to immerse myself in [the] community,” and show the culture, he says, because it is as threatened as the environment. “The way people live, you can’t just move a culture inland and have it exist the way it was.”</p>
<p>One of Kahn’s subjects was Ernie Foster, whose family has lived on the Outer Banks for generations. He can’t easily pick up and leave. “That’s what I was trying to get across: [the issues are] more complex than [saying] everyone needs to move,” Kahn says.</p>
<p>He photographed Foster in his office at a marina he has run for years. “You get a sense of who he is, through the pictures kept under the glass table there, [by the way he] keeps the books by hand, all this stuff piled up in the glass case. It’s an accumulation of his life.”</p>
<p>Kahn says he was simply having a conversation with Foster about what was happening around the Outer Banks, and what the future might bring. Kahn took a photo as Foster gazed out a window. “We kind of had a moment. Instead of positioning him, I let him operate in his own space.”</p>
<p>Kahn made a portrait of another subject, Stephanie O’Neal, sitting at a picnic table on an overcast day behind the motel her family owns. Her contemplative, worried look suggests the collective anxiety of the locals.</p>
<p>She was reluctant to have her portrait taken for the story because she didn’t want to get into the middle of the emotional argument over climate change. But she finally agreed after Kahn engaged her in a conversation. “It was a matter of building up a little bit of trust, hearing what she had to say, and [talking about] where I came from.”</p>
<p>After the trip, he sent about 100 images to <em>Audubon</em>. “We had a discussion about what I liked, what I was feeling. They were receptive, and everything I thought should be in there, was.”</p>
<p>Looking back on the project, Kahn says the only thing he might do differently would be to go at a different time of year, when there are more tourists and activity. “That was not in my control,” he says. “But I’m really happy with how the story turned out. I was able to find the right people and have them in genuine, honest situations.”</p>
<p>Kahn is continuing work on “3 Millimeters,” but he’s trying to expand it to examine the effects of climate change in other places. He predicts he’ll return to the Outer Banks at some point to do more work on his own. For now, he’s planning a trip for next winter to Australia, where drought threatens to drive people off the land in some parts of the continent.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[In black-and-white images, spare as bone but thick with texture, we see an underrepresented Afghanistan: Beyond baby-faced coalition soldiers and their cagey Taliban opponents, behind the glad-handing politicians and their cynical enablers, live ordinary Afghans who struggle to survive and dream of a better tomorrow. In the photographs in <em><a href="http://daylightbooks.org/products/dread-and-dreams">Dread and Dreams</a></em>, a new photobook by <a href="http://www.zalmai.com/">Zalma&iuml;</a> published in May by Daylight, peasants eke out a living against a barren moonscape, their simple mud homes scarred by war. The corrugated tin of the shantytown, the sodden muck of the slum, the abasement of the beggar—the images reveal the terrible mundanity of Afghanistan’s degradation. And yet, within this sea of bleak truths, there are flashes of color and subtle moments of beauty and joy. 
<p>Zalma&iuml; was born in Kabul in 1964. The Afghanistan of his birth was a sleepy country growing restive, in the midst of transitions that would exact a terrible price on this land and its people. A reformist program begun by Afghanistan’s monarch in 1964 foundered, setting in motion a string of coups that would culminate in the event that changed the course of Zalma&iuml;’s life and his nation’s future: the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the last days of 1979. “When the Russians invaded, my father had been a high ranking [official] in the government for many years,” Zalma&iuml; remembers, “and for him it was unimaginable to continue working there.”</p>
<p>The family ended up in Lausanne, Switzerland, and Zalma&iuml; studied at the School of Photography of Lausanne and the Professional Photography Training Center of Yverdon. After finishing school, he embarked on a freelance photography career that fulfilled his childhood dream of traveling. “Growing up, I remember looking at <em>National Geographic</em> and other magazines, and seeing how mysterious the world was,” he says. For the next 12 years he traversed the globe, shooting images that were published by <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>La Repubblica</em> and <em>Harper’s Magazine</em>, or on assignments for the United Nations or NGOs such as Human Rights Watch. But he did not return to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>“I was so traumatized by my experience when I left, I didn’t want to go back,” Zalma&iuml; explains. “In my mind, I thought that I lost my country, lost everything we had, but also that I had gained the planet.... I was not Afghan, I was not Swiss, I was just Zalma&iuml;.”</p>
<p>Then came the September 11 attacks and, suddenly, the eyes of the world were on Afghanistan. Unable to resist, in 2001 he entered Afghanistan from Tajikstan on assignment for Newsweek, as the Taliban was swept from power by the U.S. and its allies. For the first time since the Soviet invasion, an Afghan diaspora scattered by successive wars began returning home in droves. Trying to capture the “hope of the country,” Zalma&iuml; shot in color, delving into the stories that were going untold; the lives and dreams of Afghans scarred by violence and buoyed by sudden winds of change. Having grown up a middle-class “Kabuli” in a time of relative prosperity, Zalma&iuml; returned to a land beggared by conflict and deprivation. </p>
<p>“It was very interesting to be in a country where I understand the language and kind of understand the culture, but it is [also] very foreign,” he muses. “I did have experiences where people would say, ‘When the country needed you, you were gone. You didn’t see all this misery we saw, lucky you.’ And sometimes they would be angry, sometimes envious, sometimes happy.” Aperture published a book of that work, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zalma%C3%AF-Return-Afghanistan-Zalmai/dp/1931788499">Return, Afghanistan</a></em>, in 2004.</p>
<p>The rich and vibrant palette of that book stands in direct contrast to the stark, monochrome imagery that forms the backbone of <em>Dread And Dreams</em>. As he traveled in and out of Afghanistan on assignments for the United Nations High Commission on Refugees and various media outlets, Zalma&iuml; took note of another, darker change in the air. “After 2005 the situation got more complicated; more Taliban, more [foreign] soldiers, and of course the corruption in the government. More people started losing their hope,” Zalma&iuml; says. </p>
<p>By 2008, Zalma&iuml; had begun shooting Afghanistan primarily in black-and-white as a contrast to the optimism that he saw earlier in the decade. “For me, war steals the color from life, so the black-and-white is about the suffering and misery that war visits on people,” he explains. “But when you dream, you dream in color, so the color section of the book is the dreams of Afghan people. And that is important to me because it is those dreams that are driving the country forward, not the war.” </p>
<p>Zalma&iuml; had already completed the book when he connected with Daylight Books at the 2014 <a href="http://rokkophotofestival.com/en/">Mt. Rokko International Photo Festival</a> in Japan. He had insisted on editing the project himself, not wanting to risk diluting his vision. By the time he finished shooting in 2013, there were thousands of images to go through and attempt to fuse into a cohesive work that spoke to the dualities of Afghan life. The book is notably light on text, with only a short introduction by the author and no captions. Zalma&iuml; wrestled with this decision but felt that the images must speak for themselves. “It’s very important to me that people can look at a picture and take something from it, without [a description] having to be written at the bottom,” he says, “I just want to provoke something, so that people ask questions.” </p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[An experienced photojournalist and former <em>Newsweek</em> contributor, <a href="http://www.charlesommanney.com/">Charles Ommanney</a> had never shot any video before he pitched MSNBC an idea for a multimedia piece—combining video, stills and recorded interviews—about life along the U.S.-Mexico border. “I hadn’t even turned on the video button of my DSLR,” he says. <em>The Fence</em>, which was <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/watch/the-fence-part-1-293670979661">published in three parts on MSNBC.com</a> last summer, won 2nd prize for long feature at the World Press Photo Multimedia Awards. <em>The Fence</em> breaks many of the conventions of a video documentary: Ommanney’s interview subjects rarely appear on camera; their words are heard over the footage and stills he shot. Rather than shooting sequences that combined footage of action with B-roll, Ommanney shot long takes of the subject that is central to the film: the barrier wall that now spans about 700 miles of the nearly 2,000-mile border. Cutting across deserts and backyards, the snaking fence is a monumental presence in all the footage Ommanney shot and in the stories he gathered. Editor <a href="http://andrewhida.com/">Andrew Hida</a>, who had the task of shaping Ommanney’s sound and visuals into three coherent pieces, says of <em>The Fence</em>, “In a way it’s a character-driven narrative, but the main character never speaks.” 
<p>Ommanney had pitched his former <em>Newsweek</em> colleague, <a href="http://www.richardwolffe.com/">Richard Wolffe</a>—now executive editor at MSNBC.com—on an idea to talk to people near the U.S.-Mexico border about the issue of immigration reform. With Wolffe’s approval, Ommanney recalls, “I flew to Texas in January of 2014, and then drove in an old car from Brownsville all the way across [the] country, keeping as close to the U.S. border as I could until I got to Friendship Park near San Diego.” As he talked to people, however, he decided the story was not about immigration but about the impact of one measure taken to stop it. “It’s about the absurdity of this fence that’s been built for millions and millions of dollars that’s doing absolutely nothing,” he says. Since construction began in 2006, the barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border has cost $3 billion, and in some spots there are gaps 15 miles wide. Ommanney shot video of the fence while driving along in his car or after stopping to set up a tripod. In some footage, he shows the fence stretching across vast, inhospitable terrain, but he notes, “The fence is stopped for golf courses because high-paying golf club members didn’t want to see the fence.” </p>
<p>Soon after he arrived in Brownsville, he met and interviewed a man on Boca Chica Beach who sits and watches for immigrants. But he’s not a vigilante: He told Ommanney that one day while camping he encountered “one of the prettiest women I’ve ever seen,” who said she had walked across Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico and was planning to walk to Florida. In hindsight, he regretted he hadn’t asked her to marry him; he now watches each day, “hoping it’ll happen again,” he told Ommanney. </p>
<p>Other people Ommanney met in his travels referred him to other subjects. He conducted interviews with a diverse group of people, including an environmentalist concerned about the fence’s effect on natural migration patterns; a clergyman near San Diego who ministers to families divided by the fence; and an Arizona man who, while hiking, had come upon the body of a young woman who died crossing the border, inspiring him to research her identity and the story of her perilous journey. Ommanney notes, “One of the arguments against the fence is that it just makes people walk miles out of the way into remote areas where they die of dehydration.” </p>
<p>He conducted his interviews off-camera, inside the quiet of his car, using a R&oslash;de microphone and Zoom H4N sound recorder he had purchased before his trip; he also bought a Zacuto eyepiece and an MD filter for his camera. “I didn’t want talking heads in my film,” he explains, and says that letting the viewer imagine what the speakers look like “keeps you more interested, I think.” It also prevented any one subject from dominating the documentary, keeping the attention on “the central character” of his piece, which he calls “this serpent that runs across the country.” </p>
<p>Working by himself, Ommanney often felt frustrated “juggling such different media.” He says, “I’d be recording sound and then cursing myself for ballsing it up.” After recording what he calls “the best interview of my life,” he drove to a motel for the night, checked his gear and discovered he had forgotten to turn on the “record” button. In the morning, he drove back and re-did the interview, “but it wasn’t the same.” </p>
<p>After two and a half weeks on the road, he had a lot of material, but decided he needed more information about the border patrol agents. He spent weeks seeking permission, and in May returned to Texas to spend time with border patrol agents, shooting stills and footage when they rounded up several young men who had tried crossing the border near McAllen, Texas. </p>
<p>In June, he reviewed his roughly eight hours of footage and 3,500 stills with Andrew Hida, the editor MSNBC had suggested. Ommanney had envisioned the film as a 10-minute piece, but MSNBC insisted on showing it in three short parts to maximize viewership. “I fought that,” says Ommanney. “I said no, you’re going to water it down or weaken it.” MSNBC wouldn’t budge, so he outlined for Hida some themes that each chapter could highlight: the social cost, the economic and environmental cost, and alternatives suggested by people along the border who feel the fence is both a damaging presence and ineffective at stopping people hoping to reach the U.S.</p>
<p>Ommanney felt the story of the man on Boca Chica Beach watching for his future wife made a natural, attention-getting opener to the piece. He and Hida agreed to end the third chapter with words of hope, spoken by the pastor in California who leads weekly worship for people standing on both sides of the fence, and says he looks forward to the day the wall comes down. </p>
<p>“I loved some of those stories people shared with Charles,” Hida says. “Anyone can relate to them, even if you don’t live in El Paso or near the border.”</p>
<p>Hida organized Ommanney’s stills using Adobe Lightroom, and used Adobe Premiere to review video and audio clips. Then he began looking for similarities in the visuals, and organizing clips that shared similar themes.</p>
<p>Ommanney’s shooting method presented “both an advantage and a challenge,” Hida says. Not having to match audio interviews with footage of the subjects gave him “the poetic liberty” to show any footage he liked while using the testimonials as voiceovers that provide “a guided experience along the fence.” He notes, however, “Editors love sequences and love details,” and his job is easier when directors shoot scenes in a logical order: “You shoot tight, medium, wide, and then you move,” Hida says. Ommanney “definitely broke that rule,” he says. “He shot video [clips] like a photographer shooting stills: They’re static, the light is gorgeous, they’re composed very deliberately.” When he first saw Ommanney’s footage, he recalls, “I said, ‘Oh, man there are no sequences.’ But the way we ended up structuring the project, it didn’t matter.” </p>
<p>Ommanney says, “People seeing it have said, ‘That’s a great picture’ and I say, ‘Actually that’s not a still, that’s video.’” That similarity made it easier for Hida to interweave stills with moving footage without jarring breaks. Hida says, “I like to use two or three still images in a sequence. It allows the viewer to settle emotionally and it helps to smooth the transition.” </p>
<p>To introduce each chapter, Hida cut one short intro that would “engage the viewer in the first 10 seconds.” </p>
<p>Hida’s first cut hit most of the points Ommanney had wanted, and they continued to make adjustments. Though it was Ommanney’s first time editing video, Hida says, “Charles was good at articulating visually what he had issues with and where he wanted to try something different.” </p>
<p>Though he had balked in the beginning, Ommanney says the three-chapter structure worked, “and people really did watch all three.”</p>
<p>Despite the accolades <em>The Fence </em>has received, Ommanney has not yet shot another video. Still, he says he’s pleased with his first effort, and what he learned from the experience. “As much as it was amateur hour, I found it invigorating and freeing,” he says. While handling all the tasks on his own was challenging, it was an experience he valued. “The solitude of being out in the wilderness was very special.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<p class="p1">To appreciate how digital storage is progressing, consider this: You<span class="s1"><strong>’</strong></span>re reading the first hard drive roundup in <em>PDN</em> history to use the word <span class="s1"><strong>“</strong></span>petabyte<span class="s1"><strong>”</strong></span> (that<span class="s1"><strong>’</strong></span>s 1,000 terabytes, or 1,000,000 gigabytes). And while a petabyte might seem extravagant today, we<span class="s1"><strong>’</strong></span>re confident that with the advent of 4K video and 50-megapixel DSLRs, it won<span class="s1"><strong>’</strong></span>t be very long before such a staggering number starts to seem increasingly reasonable for at least some users. Until then, we<span class="s1"><strong>’</strong></span>ve assembled a variety of sub-petabyte options to house your digital files instead, including desktop, portable and cloud options.</p>
<p class="p3"><strong>For Desktop</strong></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s3">The <a href="http://www.g-technology.com/products/g-speed-studio-xl">G-Speed Studio XL</a> builds off the G-RAID Studio we reviewed in the December 2014 issue of<em>PDN</em>, only instead of the RAID</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">s two drive bays, the XL makes room for a total of eight removable enterprise-class 7200-RPM hard drives. The result is a system that offers a maximum 64TB of storage with data rates topping off at 1350MBps. Hard drives are loaded through a door on the front panel. The Studio XL has several RAID modes, including RAID 0, 1, 5, 10, 50, 60 and JBOD (Just a Bunch Of Disks), and like other products in the Studio line, it can be daisy-chained via dual Thunderbolt 2 ports to boost speed and capacity.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s6"><strong>LaCie 5big Thunderbolt 2</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">The <a href="https://www.lacie.com/us/products/product.htm?id=10623">5big</a> delivers ample capacity for long-term photo storage with 10-, 20- and 30TB options. Thanks to a pair of Thunderbolt 2 ports, it has the speed you need for 4K video editing. You</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">ll enjoy data-transfer speeds of up to 1050MBps, but if you leverage Thunderbolt 2</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">s daisy-chaining capabilities, you can bump up both your capacity and speed by adding more 5bigs into the mix. In fact, if money and studio space are no object, you can link a total of 36 5bigs together and enjoy a full petabyte (there</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">s that word) of storage with transfer speeds reaching a toe-curling 3000MBps. The 5big supports several hardware RAID modes, including RAID 0, 1, 5, 6, 10 and JBOD. You</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">re not stuck with a single RAID configuration, either. With five hard drives to choose from in a single enclosure, you can assign one RAID setting to, say, three drives and another RAID setting to the remaining two drives. The hard drives are hot-swappable in all but RAID 0, so you can replace drives on the fly without gumming up your workflow. The seamless aluminum-cast enclosure dissipates heat and keeps audible clicks and whirs to a minimum. </span></p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://portfolio.alicegao.com/">Alice Gao</a> is a lifestyle, travel and food photographer who has worked for Refinery29, Club Monaco, Gap, <em>Conde Nast Traveler</em>, Crate &amp; Barrel, <em>T: The New York Times Style Magazine</em> and Tiffany &amp; Co, among other brands and publications. Gao was an active member of the Flickr community when she downloaded Instagram on her phone in 2010. Initially, she didn</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">t have much interest in the app.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She began cross-posting her lifestyle and food images from Flickr, rendered in muted tones with deep shadows, onto Instagram. For the first year, she had a very small audience</span><span class="s2"><strong>—</strong></span><span class="s1">around 200 followers. Then, she suddenly began accumulating followers at a rapid pace. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">I tweeted that I thought I was hacked or there was a bug in the program!</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> she explained to <em>PDN</em> via email. A friend told her she was on Instagram</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s Suggested Users list. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">I didn</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">t even know something like that existed,</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> she recalls. Before long, she had hundreds of thousands of followers</span><span class="s2"><strong>—</strong></span><span class="s1">today, she has nearly 900,000, and brands pay her to promote them on her feed. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gao says she is able to build her following</span><span class="s2"><strong>—</strong></span><span class="s1">and keep it</span><span class="s2"><strong>—</strong></span><span class="s1">because users like that they don</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">t feel as if they</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">re being sold something. She is careful about how she integrates the products of the brands that hire her into her feed. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">The campaigns are usually very exciting, because it</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">ll be something that challenges me creatively while also allowing me to express my personal esthetic, since it</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s a collaboration.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gao</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s followers also like being along for the ride when her assignments take her to places such as the Galapagos Islands, Lima, Tokyo and Copenhagen</span>. In these locations, she often visits top-notch restaurants and hotels. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She posts images at least once a day. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">I don</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">t spend that much time on the photos,</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> she says. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">I will know quickly if I like something and will have it up on my feed almost instantly.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> Like the other photographers interviewed for this series (see related links below), Gao believes an active presence keeps her followers coming back, and compels others to recommend her feed.<br />

    <article_text><![CDATA[T<span class="s1">he emergence and growth of the social media market has offered photographers new opportunities to earn money. They</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">ve done so by shooting for brands that need images for channels like Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest; and by promoting products or companies on their own social media channels. </span>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Questions persist about how to price photographs for social media use. Standards have yet to emerge, perpetuating a </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">wild west</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> pricing situation that harkens back to the early days of digital advertising. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">I</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">ve tried to ask other reps what they</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">re doing,</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> says Beth Johnson of <a href="http://www.friendandjohnson.com/">Friend &amp; Johnson</a>. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">There isn</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">t anybody talking about it in a big way so we can all get in line with each other.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Part of the problem is lack of clarity about terms. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">A lot of times we</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">ll have clients call us and say, </span><span class="s2"><strong>‘</strong></span><span class="s1">We want digital use, Web use,</span><span class="s2"><strong>’”</strong></span><span class="s1"> Johnson adds. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">We</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">re having to really drill down on what that means.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Contributing to an already challenging situation, photographers who have large social media followings are entering the market with little professional experience. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">Somebody might charge $50, another person might charge $5,000,</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> Johnson says. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">There</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s huge value to the imagery, but we haven</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">t quite figured out what it is yet.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jennifer Haysler, managing director at <a href="http://www.sarahlaird.com/">Sarah Laird &amp; Good Company</a>, says they</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">ve used the same criteria they use to price traditional advertising</span><span class="s2"><strong>—</strong></span><span class="s1">like audience size, territory and term</span><span class="s2"><strong>—</strong></span><span class="s1">as a starting point. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">It</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s something that</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s known and existing, and it</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s something that all the art buyers and us as reps have our heads wrapped around already.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As a base for pricing, Haysler says, she</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">ll </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">look at the client</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s social media platforms, and look at their followers and their engagement on each platform.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brian DiFeo, who founded <a href="http://themobilemedialab.com/">The Mobile Media Lab</a>, a company that creates Instagram influencer campaigns for clients, says that reach, engagement and client demands all factor into how they determine pricing. The Mobile Media Lab contracts with a client, then subcontracts with photographers who meet the needs of the client, paying the photographers on the day they do the work. They</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">ll increase the price</span><span class="s2"><strong>—</strong></span><span class="s1">and what they pay the photographer</span><span class="s2"><strong>—</strong></span><span class="s1">DiFeo says, </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">if the client has an ask, like the product</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s got to be front and center [in the image] or the photographer has to feature a URL in the caption.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Included in their pricing is the client</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s right to </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">regram</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> the photographer</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s images on their own social channels and use them in perpetuity on social platforms as long as they credit the photographer, DiFeo says.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Johnson, Haysler and DiFeo all say they ask for credit to the photographer in negotiating social media usage. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">Photographers should understand how valuable presence on social media can be for themselves,</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> Haysler says. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">If they</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">re being associated with a great client and they</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">re being credited on that company</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s social media platform, it has its own big value.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The term of the license is another important factor in determining pricing. Johnson says that for the past eight years </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">the first thing that anybody asks for is unlimited use for an unlimited period of time.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> Convincing clients that an unlimited term should cost more, and that a limited buy makes more sense, is difficult, she says. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">In their mind they don</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">t want to ever have to worry about it again, but many times [the image] goes on a shelf [after time]</span><span class="s2"><strong>…</strong></span><span class="s1">never to be thought of again, so they</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">re paying for usage they don</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">t need to pay for.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Haysler says that clients have begun shortening the length of the usage term </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">as a bargaining piece in trying to get the usage fee lowered.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> She</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s seeing clients ask for </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">one month or three months, sometimes three weeks.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> Even though an image will stay on a social feed for a long time, she considers the term the period of time that the client can actively post and repost an image to their social media feeds. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">In theory that image may only be seen once even though they have it for a three-month usage because social media is so quick</span><span class="s2"><strong>…</strong></span><span class="s1">. How many people are digging back through months of a company</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s Instagram feed to find an image? They probably aren</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">t.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The specter of work-for-hire agreements and copyright buyouts has also carried into social media. Johnson says clients are </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">many times asking for the copyright.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> Haysler says </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">some brands have requested that,</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> but adds, </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">I think they</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">re the same brands that have always tried to go that route. I don</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">t see it any more than we did before.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p2">Johnson says, <span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span>We don<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>t sell the copyright,<span class="s3"><strong>”</strong></span> and emphasizes the importance of  <span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span>educating the younger group of people who are new to this industry about why copyright is so important. We<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>ve fought so hard to make that a very big part of our conversation and it<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>s falling away quickly, so my rule is that you should never sell the copyright. And if you<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>re asked to sell it, you should make the price so incredibly high that they don<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>t want it.<span class="s3"><strong>”</strong></span> The problem, she says, is that some people are selling their copyrights inexpensively, or offering unlimited, perpetual use for low rates. <span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span>It<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>s a difficult place to be because it<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>s hard to negotiate what most people feel are fair rates with realistic usage attached when there are so many people just willy-nilly giving rights away.<span class="s3"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">We all have to remember that there has to be a minimum at some point,</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> Haysler says. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">A lot of clients try to undervalue images because of how quickly things are used and gone on social media</span><span class="s2"><strong>…</strong></span><span class="s1">. I think it</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s a different minimum for each photographer, but there has to be something in place that protects that.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Haysler says she doesn</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">t think fees for social media usage will ever reach those for traditional advertising usage. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">You could argue that social media is perpetually going to be bigger and bigger usage because it</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s going to be more users everyday,</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> she says. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">But on the other side you could argue that it</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s smaller, because with print or out of home, an audience can be passive and still be reached.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> Audiences have to actively follow brands to see what they</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">re putting out on social media, she notes. Targeted ads that allow brands to reach people who don</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">t follow them, however, could help social media fees reach those commanded by print. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">I feel like that is going to be the next delineation that we as agents have to look into: Is this social media usage for a company</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s channel, or is it going to be sold through into advertising on a social media channel? I think those would be different usage fees.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span></p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[For the last 14 years, <strong>Jeff Tammes</strong> has worked at <a href="http://www.cornerstoneagency.com/">Cornerstone</a>, a multi-disciplinary agency based in New York City. When he started in 2002, the agency had only eight employees; now they count the likes of Budweiser, Diageo and Converse among their roster of clients. As the head of creative and strategy, Tammes says a large part of what he does is help his team develop stories around a client’s brand, and find innovative ways to share them throughout the life of a campaign. Here he tells <em>PDN</em> about what Cornerstone does best, how they use photography and what they look for in photographers. 
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>:</strong></span><strong> What kinds of services does Cornerstone offer?</strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><strong>JT:</strong></span> We started early on creating projects inspired by music, projects telling the story of fashion and music culture that inspired us. Brands started coming to us to help them identify how we can tell their story for them: how we can create this credible story of who they are and how they can connect with the consumer through that. For Converse, specifically, we are their lead agency on all lifestyle music activity. Budweiser is a client of ours; we work for many different spirits brands within Diageo. We do some work on some other interesting campaigns a little bit outside of that; one is called Families for Excellent Schools, which is creating a movement, rallying people around the education crisis in New York City. We do work for Bit Torrent. In most cases, photography starts to really play a role in not only what you would call traditional advertising, but how we<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>re integrating [it] into point-of-sale materials, to even the kind of daily storytelling we<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>re doing through digital channels. </p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>:</strong></span><strong> What are some of the ways you utilize photography?</strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><strong>JT:</strong></span> We<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>re taking photography and then making a lot of social media communication with it, around it and inspired by it. Especially in the case of spirits, the drink shots, [we<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>re making] a variety of point-of-sale materials, and are constantly looking for new ways to do that in a more beautiful way. Then we<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>ll often look at above-the-line, more traditional advertising; out-of-home, print, those mediums. That photography ends up being part of the finished product. So even if we<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>re telling a lifestyle story in an ad communication, product always becomes an important part of that story, and it will be used there. Taking a step beyond social media, there<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>s press outreach, and that photography becomes really important; to supply editorial photography, beautiful photography that properly represents the story we<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>re sharing.</p>
<p class="p5">There<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>s also <a href="http://www.converse-music.com/rubbertracks/">Rubber Tracks</a>, something we created for Converse. It<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>s a global platform now, but it started and is headquartered in the recording studio we built in Brooklyn, which serves as a community center, where we give away free studio time to aspiring bands. Photography helps us tell the story of what<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>s happening in there day-to-day. We don<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>t do canned shoots or above-the-line photography in the studio. It<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>s much more about the constant capture of what<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>s happening within the studio and around the studio, events and experiences we do around it. </p>
<p class="p5">We have an editor in there full-time who is capturing a lot of that photography. When we have specific initiatives, we might bring in [photographers] to stay in there for a kind of a <span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span>photography residency.<span class="s3"><strong>”</strong></span> </p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s4"><strong><em>PDN</em>:</strong></span><span class="s5"><strong> How do you find the photographers you hire to document what happens in the studio? </strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s6"><strong>JT:</strong></span><span class="s5"> We get to know them from their own hustle; a lot of them are photographers that are already showing up at the types of events that are relevant to Converse Rubber Tracks. They are documenting the music experiences, they are very much a part of that culture. So when we want to tell a story through photography, and get someone that we know understands that scene, understands what</span><span class="s7"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s5">s being created there, we</span><span class="s7"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s5">ll typically go back to them and ask them to come in and [shoot] that for us. <a href="http://www.danieldorsa.com/">Daniel Dorsa</a> recently shot all the Converse South by Southwest stuff for us.</span> </p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>:</strong></span><strong> Who are some other photographers you’ve found this way?</strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><strong>JT:</strong></span> <a href="http://jonathanmannion.com/">Jonathan Mannion</a>, who we<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>ve worked with for years on different campaigns, is a guy from back in the early days of the company that was really active in documenting New York<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>s music scene<span class="s3"><strong>—</strong></span>specifically the hip-hop scene<span class="s3"><strong>—</strong></span>and built incredible relationships throughout that industry, and became a supporter of a lot of the projects we were doing at that time. We started a magazine out of Cornerstone called <em><a href="http://www.thefader.com/">The FADER</a>,</em> and Jonathan was a photographer who was very active in shooting for that magazine. As we<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>ve grown as a company, we<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>ve brought him on to help us tell those stories. One example is the campaign we did for Bushmills Irish whiskey: The photography that was needed for that [included] a lot of product photography, which has its own nuances and a different approach. But a big part of the Bushmills storytelling was bringing in people who were ambassadors for the brand who were somewhat recognizable: Aaron Paul, Chromeo, Elijah Wood. Knowing Jonathan over the years, his great skill is that he connects with his subjects in an incredible way, and can always get the most authentic, realest vibe going with them when they<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>re in a studio. He can take any situation and make it relaxed, and we knew we needed that for the Bushmill<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>s photography. We saw his passion, and got to know him and gave him a shot based on that. </p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s4"><strong><em>PDN</em>:</strong></span><span class="s5"><strong> What do clients find attractive about Cornerstone as an agency?</strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><strong>JT:</strong></span> <span class="s5">When we started, music led a lot of what we were doing. We</span><span class="s7"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s5">ve played a very active role in music since the inception of the company. So a lot of brands do come to us for our expertise there. A lot of brands and clients come to us because they think we have an ability to connect with the consumer in a more authentic way, frankly. Our approach has always been, </span><span class="s7"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s5">How do we take who you are and identify what</span><span class="s7"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s5">s going to be special about you to your consumer, and start to further entrench you in their lifestyle?</span><span class="s7"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s5"> People don</span><span class="s7"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s5">t come to us to just get the word out that, </span><span class="s7"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s5">Here</span><span class="s7"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s5">s the commodity, and it costs X.</span><span class="s7"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s5"> For the spirit brands, Converse, Budweiser, the Families for Excellent Schools, or the NBA</span><span class="s7"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s5">s Milwaukee Bucks, a new client of ours who wanted to tell a new story about the team and new ownership: In all those cases, we don</span><span class="s7"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s5">t want to just advertise [on behalf of the client]...essentially, we want to create a movement.</span> </p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>:</strong></span><strong> How do you find new photographers?</strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><strong>JT:</strong></span> We<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>re always looking for photographers who can demonstrate an ability to capture real life, and not so much a composed lifestyle. We<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>ve identified that in two ways: The first is what I was talking about before: people we see actively participating and telling stories on their own. Then of course in a more traditional sense, it<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>s people who meet with us and share their work and share their books. You can see it come through in their work, obviously. </p>
<p class="p5">The other type of photography which we<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>ve been doing more recently is <span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span>hero<span class="s3"><strong>”</strong></span> product stuff, and it<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>s a whole different animal for us. We<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>re working with drink stylists because we<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>re looking to create unique, classic visuals that can stand alone, but be highly adaptable because we<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>ll end up using them in multiple forms, multiple layouts. <a href="http://www.gentlandhyers.com/">Gentl &amp; Hyers</a> are people we<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>ve worked with a few times who have been great. </p>
<p class="p5">We<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>ve also been looking more and more at people doing interesting things with GIFs. Because of that, we<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>re more actively looking at social media profiles of photographers to figure out if they<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>re the right person to talk to about a particular project. We<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>ll do that a lot for some of the social media feeds of our clients; some of that [is shot by] our in-house production staff, and other times we<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>ll bring in other [artists] with a bigger audience in that [social media] space. For example, with Rubber Tracks, we<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>re starting to bring in guest GIF artists like Mr. GIF, GIFRIENDS and Golden Wolf to do some storytelling for a prolonged period of time [in] the studio; in that Families for Excellent Schools example, we<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>re also in the process now of creating different tools just to play with some of the numbers and stats we<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>ve been talking about [in relation to education].  </p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>:</strong></span><strong> What advice can you give an emerging photographer who wants to work with you?</strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><strong>JT:</strong></span> The hustle that I was referencing earlier<span class="s3"><strong>—</strong></span>being there<span class="s3"><strong>—</strong></span>is still important. Now it<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>s even more important to figure out how to get your story out there through photography in digital environments. More and more we<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>re looking at social media, and looking at Instagram pages for photographers. We<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>re looking to see if they<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>re telling a story that<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>s connecting and building an audience. That<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>s always incredibly compelling to us, maybe more so than the [technique]. If they have a unique perspective, and when they shoot something they tell a story with it, and it seems to be resonating and people react to it<span class="s3"><strong>—</strong></span>that<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>s where social media audience is an interesting gauge of [whether a photographer] would be worth bringing into a campaign. </p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I </span><span class="s1">would say without question I was completely unprepared,</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> says <a href="http://www.ronhaviv.com/">Ron Haviv</a> of his first forays into war reporting as a young freelancer. Haviv began his career covering civil conflict in Panama and </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">grew up during the war in Yugoslavia,</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> which he covered for a decade from 1991</span><span class="s2"><strong>–</strong></span><span class="s1">2000.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">During his early career, Haviv says, </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">I made many mistakes that I was lucky enough to survive, while colleagues of mine who made the same mistakes were either wounded or killed.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Nearly 30 years later, photojournalist <a href="http://www.nicoletung.com/">Nicole Tung</a> bought a plane ticket to Egypt to cover the Arab Spring. Her experience with, and training for, reporting in hostile environments was </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">pretty much zero,</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> she says. Tung had contacts with journalists on the ground and </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">relied on my own wits and instinct.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> Later she went to Libya on her own, connected with other journalists and </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">started picking up assignments with the writers who were reporting from there.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The paths Haviv and Tung took into conflict reporting</span><span class="s2"><strong>—</strong></span><span class="s1">going to report a story they felt compelled to tell and working at times without assignments or guarantees</span><span class="s2"><strong>—</strong></span><span class="s1">have been trod by young, committed journalists for time immemorial. The assumption is that a reliable, serious freelance journalist who does good work will find assignments and/or a home for their stories with news organizations.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Yet in the past two years, as record numbers of journalists have been targeted, kidnapped, imprisoned, and murdered in videos broadcast across the world, the news business</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1"> already complicated relationship with freelancers has become increasingly fraught. Questions of safety</span><span class="s2"><strong>—</strong></span><span class="s1">and of who is responsible and liable when things go wrong in the field</span><span class="s2"><strong>—</strong></span><span class="s1">have caused editors to shy away from assigning freelancers, and even from picking up stories photographers produce on their own. They fear that publishing the work will encourage more freelancers to travel into conflict zones.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In response to the murders of freelance journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, a group of volunteers drafted a Global Safety Principles and Practices document, which was released publicly at a gathering at Columbia University</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s <a href="http://dartcenter.org/">DART Center for Journalism and Trauma</a> on February 12. The drafters included members of the AP, The DART Center, Frontline Freelance Register, Human Rights Watch, the Overseas Press Club, Reuters, <em>The New York Times</em> and other organizations.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The standards advocate that freelancers on dangerous assignments complete first aid and hostile environment training; seek adequate medical insurance for conflict zones or infectious disease areas; and use </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">protective ballistic clothing, including armored jackets and helmets.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The standards also urge that journalists both on assignment and working independently conduct risk assessments before traveling to conflict zones; plan routes and daily check-ins with editors or colleagues; and </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">take appropriate precautions to secure mobile and internet communications from intrusion and tracking.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> (To see the full Global Safety Principles and Practices document visit <a href="http://dartcenter.org/content/global-safety-principles-and-practices#.VYdIQxNViko">dartcenter.org/content/global-safety-principles-and-practices</a>.)</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The document also lists principles for news organizations to follow. It specifies that editors and news organizations recognize that freelancers and local journalists </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">play an increasingly vital role in international coverage, particularly on dangerous stories</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1">; that editors and news organizations should </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">show the same concern</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> for local journalists and freelancers as they would for staffers; and that, for freelancers and local journalists they work with regularly, news organizations should help with safety training and equipment, and take </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">responsibility in the event of injury or kidnap.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The document also says, </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">News organizations should not make an assignment with a freelancer in a conflict zone or dangerous environment</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> unless they are prepared to take responsibility for the well-being of the freelancer, calling it a </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">moral responsibility.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Agence France Press, The Associated Press, the BBC, Guardian News and Media, <em>Newsweek</em>, The Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, Overseas Press Club of America, Reporters Without Borders, Reuters and <em>USA Today</em> were among organizations that had signed on to the document as we went to press. Journalist David Rohde, one of the document</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s drafters, told <em>PDN</em> via email that he hopes more organizations will sign on after a follow-up meeting on April 23 at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. But there are still several major news organizations that have not signed on. <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and <em>TIME</em> are reviewing the standards, Rohde says. Photo agencies such as VII, Magnum Photos and Noor are also missing from the list.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">Our overall goal was to spark a conversation in the news industry regarding freelancer safety,</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> Rohde says. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">Some organizations have signed onto the guidelines. Others have started internal reviews of how they handle freelancer safety. Either way, we</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">re happy the issue is being discussed.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> To produce something that satisfies both freelancers and news organizations and their lawyers is no easy task, and the document is worded less strongly than freelancers might like. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://viiphoto.com/">VII Photo</a> is among the organizations still discussing the standards internally, says Haviv, one of the founders of the photo agency. He has worked with the group that drafted the document. <span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span>Speaking for myself, I personally feel that the language is not strong enough to protect us,<span class="s3"><strong>”</strong></span> he says. Haviv says he<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>s <span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span>very appreciative of the ideas that are presented,<span class="s3"><strong>”</strong></span> and that heads of the signatory news organizations acknowledge that <span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span>these are real issues that need to be addressed by the entire community.<span class="s3"><strong>”</strong></span> The organizers have touted this as a starting point for broader discussion and stronger standards, he says, <span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span>and I<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>m hoping that<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>s correct and that<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>s why I<span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span>m working with them.<span class="s3"><strong>”</strong></span>  </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Tung, who is on the board of directors of the <a href="http://www.frontlinefreelance.org/">Frontline Freelance Register</a>, an organization that advocates for freelance journalists, saw earlier drafts of the standards. She says that the initial wording </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">was a lot stronger.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> For instance, it addressed a publication</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s responsibility if they pick up work a journalist produced on spec. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">This document is really addressing the on-assignment stuff,</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> she says.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">A lot of people have criticized this whole document, saying that it</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s an exercise in hand-washing and that no more responsibility is being taken by the publications, but I think it was an important step to recognizing the responsibilities of both sides,</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> Tung adds.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Haviv says that the training and equipment necessary to prepare freelancers properly for dangerous assignments are readily available, but they</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">re costly. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">Obviously budgets are an issue,</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> he says. While organizations including the <a href="https://rorypecktrust.org/">Rory Peck Trust</a> subsidize some training for journalists, </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">there</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s not enough of that, especially for the freelance photographers, to automatically be able to go and get this training before going into the field.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> Freelancers in the field are responsible not only for themselves, but the people they hire, like drivers, fixers and translators, Haviv says. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">It</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s getting to the point where it can be considered a criminal act to go into a conflict zone and not have the correct training, equipment and insurance.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Tung points out that safety and fair pay are connected. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">If you don</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">t pay us enough or fairly, we</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">re more likely to cut corners,</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> she says. For instance, rather than hiring a trusted driver for a weeklong assignment, a freelancer might take cabs, she says. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">In a dangerous environment, you don</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">t know who you can trust and that becomes a safety issue, so we want people to understand that.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If publications take more responsibility for freelancers, Tung says, they may want to </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">pick up a freelancer who they know they can trust, who</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s been through some security training, which is a good thing.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While the Global Safety Principles and Practices may or may not lead to </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">a shared commitment to safety and a new spirit of collegiality and concern</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> between freelancers and news organizations, as the document states, both Tung and Haviv believe young freelancers will continue to travel independently into conflict zones.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">If they believe in the story and have something to say, people should cover conflict, but with the proper tools,</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> Haviv says. </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">Where there</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s a will there</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">s a way,</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s1"> Tung adds. Despite her lack of experience and training, experienced journalists took Tung under their wing because she proved she was serious.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Says Haviv: </span><span class="s2"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s1">I tell this to every student in my workshops and I tell it to any photographer that talks to me about wanting to be a conflict photographer</span><span class="s2"><strong>…</strong></span><span class="s1">. I</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">m not going to go anywhere with you or even stand next to you in the field if I don</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">t believe that you know what you</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">re doing. Because I</span><span class="s2"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s1">ve seen what can happen when people are not properly trained.</span><span class="s2"><strong>”</strong><br />

    <article_text><![CDATA[In 2010, as newsrooms were cutting budgets and a shrinking number of media organizations were sending photographers to cover stories overseas, <em>PDN</em> reported on the opportunities that new, non-profit journalism organizations had been providing for photographers. In this 2010 interview, Nathalie Applewhite, the managing director of The Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which was founded in 2006, spoke to us about her organization's support of photographer-writer teams.<br />
<br />
Below is our full interview with Applewhite, in which she describes the role photography plays in the work The Pulitzer Center supports, how photojournalists can strengthen their applications for funding, and how the organization expects its grantees to help reach an audience well beyond readers of a single media outlet.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: What function does the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting serve for journalists?<br />
<br />
Nathalie Applewhite:</strong> We cover the hard costs associated with international reporting. We're trying to fill the gap between what the media outlets can no longer afford on their own when they are willing to run a story.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: In addition to a project proposal that fits the Pulitzer Center mission, what should journalists who are looking for funding have when they apply?<br />
<br />
NA: </strong>We want them to have a strong interest [in publishing the story] from media outlets. The idea is that the media outlets should still pay the journalists for their work, and we're committed to making sure the journalists, as much as possible, are getting revenue for that.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: Do you assist with distributing the work as well, or is that left to the journalist?<br />
<br />
NA: </strong>We need to see enough of a distribution plan in line for us to take something on. We don't want a plan where it's just completely in the abstract, but once we do commit to a project then we're really invested in seeing the project get to as many people and in as many media outlets as possible, so we'll work with the journalist to try to find additional venues for it.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: On the Pulitzer Center site it says the organization is trying to focus on "multiplatform." Why is that a focus?<br />
<br />
NA:</strong> Our overarching mission is not just to support the work, it's to raise awareness for the issues that the journalists are covering, and the best way to do that is to use as many different platforms as possible to generate interest. <br />
<br />
To have short video on YouTube linked to a blog, which links to an article that has photographs—having many different pieces gives us the opportunity to spread that [story] across all these different outlets, so different audiences can ideally follow the full path through all of the mediums and explore that and really get as much as possible out of the reporting that we've supported in the first place.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: You also encourage partnerships between journalists working in different medias. Why is that important?<br />
<br />
NA: </strong>There's been somewhat of a trend of print reporters being expected to become videographers, and everyone's trying to be this one-man band, but I strongly believe that people have areas where they have their strongest skills and they should really focus on that. If we have to pay a little extra money to have the quality video along with the print, or the quality photographs along with the strong radio piece [we do that]. You can end up lessening the quality of everything overall if you try to do too much.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: How important is photography to telling and distributing a story?<br />
<br />
NA: </strong>We live in a visual culture and in order to grab people's attention it really helps to have a strong image to draw people in. It's definitely more universal, it translates across cultures and across languages, and it gives us a way to have greater reach overall. <br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: As an organization that is supported through grants and funding from donors, does visual reporting also contribute to Pulitzer Center fundraising?<br />
<br />
NA: </strong>Absolutely. We struggle sometimes with the photography-only projects, because those are harder to place in as many mainstream outlets. We've had excellent proposals from photojournalists that we haven't been able to support, because we get such a volume of proposals in the first place, and they're harder for us to place across as a wide range of outlets than some of the other pitches that we get. But what we have found is that all of our projects where we've had strong photographers, those materials become very precious to us in putting out our brochures and annual reports and things like that. There's a second phase of value there.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: Are you seeing proposals from photojournalists who want to produce both stills and video, and if they want to do both does that help their chances of receiving funding?<br />
<br />
NA: </strong>Yes, absolutely.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: How important are multimedia pieces to distributing a story and building momentum for a project?<br />
<br />
NA:</strong> The format definitely helps. My background is in video production, so I know putting together a solid five-minute documentary can be a really involved process and it takes a lot of different skills to do that, but putting together a Sound Slides show...certainly not everybody can do the same quality show, but even print reporters who don't have the experience can be able to put together something very strong where they're combining their narrative with some of the images they've captured, which can be a really great introduction to the issues for the audience.<br />
<br />
One of our requirements for most of our grantees is to produce an audio slideshow. It's dependent on the specific project… We also ask them to produce a blog with photography. Grantees have to do Wikipedia entries [for their stories]. We want to make sure that they're putting whatever they've found out in the mix.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: Do you help grantees who don't have multimedia skills with production?<br />
<br />
NA: </strong>[Grantees] have done a lot with Time.com and just worked directly with the producer there. If they are producing just for our site and want to put together a Sound Slides show, we've worked with them on formatting and structure. We have a small staff managing a huge volume of projects, so we want people to do it on their own but [our staff] ends up mentoring people. <br />
<br />
It is rewarding because you see people, who may be resistant to creating a multimedia piece, and they come back with these 15 strong images and they can do it and they have a strong story. With some good guidelines you can create something very strong that can draw people into the larger print piece or video production.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: Do you support projects that are undertaken by photojournalists alone, or do they generally work with partners?<br />
<br />
NA: </strong>We've had several projects where we have just worked directly with photojournalists. We may have helped them editing some of the writing they were doing, but they had enough confidence [to create a multiplatform story]. In general it's more likely that they would be paired up with a writer or radio reporter.<br />
<strong><br />
PDN: What is the biggest mistake journalists make when applying for funding from the Pulitzer Center?<br />
<br />
NA: </strong>The same mistake that anybody makes. Not taking time to look at the site and the work that the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting is supporting. I get a lot of questions that would take five minutes to answer if people looked at our site. It's kind of insulting; if you want us to support the work and you're a journalist I would think [you could do the research].<br />
<br />
Sometimes people think of us just as a funder, but we're really more than that. Yes we're supporting the reporting, but we really take these projects on as campaigns, so we want to have a relationship with the journalist that we're working with and see that they're committed to seeing the story through. <br />
<br />
It's not just about the publication or about placing it in one big outlet, it's about drawing attention to this issue over a long time. In some cases we've seen photojournalists and videographers who think [the project is] done when it's published and so their job is done and just walk away. We'd like people to be more committed to continuing that process.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: Is it difficult to place stories in a number of outlets if the work has also been published elsewhere?<br />
<br />
NA: </strong>Outlets were really exclusive, and once they ran the picture they had ownership of it. Because of the crisis in the industry, media outlets are less willing to put those restrictions on it unless they're really willing to pay for it, and that's good news as far as spreading awareness of the kinds of crises that we're trying to draw attention to because it means that people can take that story elsewhere. <br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: What should journalists seeking funding take into account when they apply?<br />
<br />
NA:</strong> See what else we've covered. We are only funding a maximum of 50 projects annually, and we're trying to scale that down so we can give more attention to each one. [Applicants should] take geographic diversity into consideration.<br />
<br />
People often misinterpret our organization title and think we're looking for conflict coverage. We're not looking for conflict coverage. We're about looking at underlying causes, what leads up to the crises, what follows the headlines.<br />
<br />
Generally the proposals are very much in tune, [applicants] seem to have done the research. The photographers are really struggling to get their stories out there because they're not covering things that are making headlines, so they need support to cover that kind of in-depth story.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: Are journalists who are working in partnership at an advantage in terms of their application for funding? <br />
<br />
NA: </strong>It does tend to help on the distribution end of it and for us. If [a print reporter] comes to us and has a relationship with the Christian Science Monitor, and a photographer has a relationship with Time.com—whatever the outlets are—this to us is a stronger guarantee that it's going to reach an audience. That's just a really key component because we have such limited funds we need to make sure that the dollars we spend are going towards something that's going to reach the public.<br />

</span><span class="s1"><strong>Art director:</strong></span><span class="s2"> Craig Love</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">To introduce the sports drink <a href="http://www.drinkheadon.com/">HeadOn</a>, creatives at the ad agency <a href="http://www.strawberryfrog.com/">StrawberryFrog</a> wanted to show believable images of athletes in moments of intense exertion, rather than highlighting celebrity endorsements from star players. </span><span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s2">They wanted to show athletes in peak action,</span><span class="s3"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s2"> says commercial photographer and director <a href="http://garyland.com/">Gary Land</a>, who</span><span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s2">s known for his gritty, dark sports imagery. He submitted an estimate for the job and wrote a treatment explaining how he would capture the look and convey the message the creatives wanted. Writing a successful treatment, he says, is about demonstrating an understanding of the client</span><span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s2">s idea, </span><span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s2">then writing about how I plan to execute it.</span><span class="s3"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s2"> His treatment landed him the assignment, and his estimate convinced the client to focus on just four sports: soccer, football, basketball and CrossFit. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The creatives had referenced images in Land</span><span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s2">s portfolio that they liked that were in the style he describes as </span><span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s2">augmented reality.</span><span class="s3"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s2"> Based on the references, he says, </span><span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s2">I knew they wanted the key light to be behind the subject.</span><span class="s3"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s2"> He also suggested bringing in a hazer to create a mist in the background of each shot: </span><span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s2">It helps add drama to the scene. It is especially nice when your lights shine through it.</span><span class="s3"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><strong>Logistics</strong></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Land, who is based near Boston, had suggested doing all the shots in a sports complex in Hanover, Massachusetts, with 40-foot-high ceilings and no sources of natural light: The facility has multiple basketball courts, soccer pitches and a small gym. Land always budgets a day for tech scouting. For the HeadOn shoot, he worked with a crew of ten, including a hair and makeup person, a wardrobe stylist, a digital tech, a producer, production assistants, his long-time gaffer Jeff Douglass and two other assistants. Land</span><span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s2">s production company, <a href="http://www.glpcreative.com/">GLP Creative,</a> owns a grip truck equipped with all the lights he needs for both film and still productions. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">To cast the shots, Land suggested some athletes he had worked with on previous shoots, including a soccer player from Brandeis who had been in a Coca-Cola commercial that Land directed, and a woman who works out at the same gym Land goes to. Before he hires real athletes, he always does video casting. </span><span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s2">I</span><span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s2">ve been burned many times when someone has said, </span><span class="s3"><strong>‘</strong></span><span class="s2">Oh sure, I can run.</span><span class="s3"><strong>’”</strong></span><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When he</span><span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s2">s directing sports shots and needs to get peak performance out of his models, Land notes, </span><span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s2">Before the shoot, I</span><span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s2">ll have a little pep talk with people and say, </span><span class="s3"><strong>‘</strong></span><span class="s2">This is why you were chosen out of 300 people. I need you to bring it.</span><span class="s3"><strong>’”</strong></span><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><strong>Lighting</strong><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Land says that when he set up the lights for the shoot, the first shot provided the template he followed to keep the look consistent throughout the campaign. He starts by setting up the key lights, then moves on to the fill, he says. </span><span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s2">In this case, considering we were shooting sports in action, we decided on using harder lights, such as Magnums, 7-inch reflectors and dishes.</span><span class="s3"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Land uses Profoto Pro-8 packs. </span><span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s2">I use those because they have fast flash duration and recycle times,</span><span class="s3"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s2"> he says. He typically uses bi-tubes for extra power </span><span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s2">when I have to stop action.</span><span class="s3"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s2"> His preferred light modifier is a Profoto Magnum, a large strobe reflector with a 50-degree-angle beam spread, because he likes the control it gives him. </span><span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s2">It</span><span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s2">s great for sports, and for re-creating sun.</span><span class="s3"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s2"> To give him the freedom to move his lights around from set to set, or to adjust to an athlete</span><span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s2">s movements, he set most of his lights on medium rollers. The rollers are sturdier than C-stands, and Land uses them often on film productions, or when he needs flexibility. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">For one of his shots of a basketball player driving towards the net, he set up his camera under the basket. Land wanted to backlight the athlete to match the rest of the shots in the campaign. He also wanted edge lights on both sides of the player</span><span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s2">s body, to make sure he stood out dramatically from the black background. Land had one Magnum on a medium roller set at its maximum height</span><span class="s3"><strong>—</strong></span><span class="s2">about 15 feet high. To the left he had another Magnum high on a medium roller to rim-light the athlete. Lower on the roller</span><span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s2">s stand, he also had a second light with a 7-inch reflector. Set at lower power, this smaller reflector hit the player</span><span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s2">s legs and feet. The DF-50 hazer was placed on the floor between the rollers, casting a mist over the back of the hall. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At camera right, he had another 7-inch reflector at the top of a medium roller. This added additional edge lighting, and also shone through the mist from the hazer. Behind the camera, he had a silver beauty dish with a grid to provide some fill. The dish was attached to a medium roller by a mega boom. As Land changed angles, looking for the perfect positioning of the athlete in the air, he could move the beauty dish, keeping it behind the camera. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Land continued his use of backlighting in his photo of a woman doing pull ups in a dark gym, where the gaffer attached one light and Magnum to a beam on the back wall, and another on a highboy stand. For his front lighting, Land diffused the light by setting up a silk and using strobes with 7-inch reflectors behind her and to camera right, to light her lower back. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><strong>Camera </strong></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Land shot with a Hasselblad H4X with a 28mm f/4 lens and a Leaf Credo 50 digital back. </span><span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s2">I shot pretty much at 1/500th of a second at f/9,</span><span class="s3"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s2"> and was usually shooting at ISO 400. Land adds, </span><span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s2">The good thing about </span>the digital back is that it<span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span>s awesome with low light now.<span class="s4"><strong>”</strong></span> Shooting at a low angle, with the camera on sandbags or on a low tripod, Land shot tethered to his digital tech<span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span>s iMac, which has a 27-inch monitor. The digital tech, Max Gordon, also screen-shares the images to a MacBook Pro that Land places near his camera as he shoots, so he can check that he<span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span>s captured the action he wants. While Gordon reviewed the shots in CaptureOne software, zooming in on details, clients flagged the shots they liked. Land notes, <span class="s4"><strong>“</strong></span>That<span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span>s the other thing about the camera: Not only is the file size huge, but the dynamic range is incredible.<span class="s4"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><strong>Postproduction</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Land</span><span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s2">s retouching is handled by <a href="http://www.tridentpp.com/">Trident Post Production</a>, which he owns and which operates out of his studio. A member of the Trident team came to the shoot and was on hand when the client signed off on the look and images they wanted. After a hard drive is delivered to Trident, Land likes to check the retouching and color correction, he says, </span><span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s2">like a director being involved in the film-editing process.<strong>"</strong></span></p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[PDN takes a look at a handful of magazines and websites that got a fresh coat of paint, as well as some of the new kids on the block. 
<p><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/NYTMagCover_s.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong><em>The New York Times Magazine</em></strong></p>
<p>Jake Silverstein was lured from <em><a href="http://www.texasmonthly.com/">Texas Monthly</a></em> to oversee the transition of the 119-year-old magazine’s new look and website, which will feature a regular column on photography by <a href="http://www.tejucole.com/">Teju Cole</a>. The new site will feature photos run large, from edge-to-edge on both mobile and desktop browsers, more Web-only galleries and extended photo essays from the print magazine. The first issue had four covers, featuring work from Matthew Pillsbury, Hannah Whitaker, Sara Cwynar and the duo Maurizio Cattelan and Pierpaolo Ferrari, whose work is on this month’s cover of <em>PDN</em>.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/SelfFeatures_s.jpg" /><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Self.com</strong></p>
<p>After a 2013 print redesign, Conde Nast installed new editor-in-chief Joyce Chang, who oversaw a redesign of the brand’s website. Brooklyn-based <a href="http://athleticsnyc.com/">Athletics NYC</a> was tasked with the site’s image-centric redesign, which <a href="http://fashionista.com/2014/09/self-magazine-october-2014">Chang told fashionista.com</a> “is, in itself, an Instagram feed writ large.”</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/MaximCover_s.jpg" /><br />
</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Maxim </em></strong></p>
<p>Kate Lamphear, the former style director at <em>T: The New York Times Style Magazine</em>, was hired as editor-in-chief to implement a more mature version of the lad magazine. The debut <a href="http://www.maxim.com/women/article/candice-swanepoel-maxims-march-2015-cover-girl">“Raw”-themed issue</a> featured original photography from Jamie Chung, Sigurd Gr&uuml;nberger, Lorenzo Agius, Dan Forbes, Robert Nethery, Gilles Bensimon, Edwin Tse, Andreas Laszlo Konrath, Anuschka Blommers &amp; Niels Schumm, Bobby Bruderle and Michael Piazza.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/PaperCover_s.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Paper</em></strong></p>
<p>The 30-year-old downtown New York art, fashion and culture magazine got a redesign in the fall, with new typefaces and a new bordered cover format that eschews full-bleed photos. <a href="http://www.papermag.com/2014/11/kim_kardashian_paper_jean_paul_goude.php">Jean-Paul Goude’s cover shoot for the Winter 2014 issue</a> recreated his infamous Carolina Beaumont “Champagne Incident” shoot with Kim Kardashian-West, which <em>PAPER</em> declared to “Break the Internet.”</p>
<p><strong><em><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/CondeNastTraveler02_s.jpg" /><br />
</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Cond&eacute; Nast Traveler</em></strong></p>
<p>Looking to find its footing in the age of Instagram and TripAdvisor .com, the Conde Nast travel title got freshened up, though the most prominent change is likely the redesign of its logo. The new magazine features the occasional two-page spread, but much of the photography is oriented vertically, especially in the front of the book. </p>
<p><strong><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/eater.com-2_s.jpg" /><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eater.com &amp; Racked.com </strong></p>
<p>Since Vox Media acquired the Curbed network (which includes <a href="http://curbed.com/">Curbed.com</a>, <a href="http://www.racked.com/">Racked.com</a> and <a href="http://www.eater.com/">Eater.com</a>), both Racked (fashion retail) and Eater (food) have been redesigned, and the sites now use Vox Media’s vaunted content management system. Eater, redesigned in September, has rolled out a longform features page edited by Helen Rosner, which gives a home to large-scale, image-centric narrative storytelling.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/OfficeCover_s.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Office </em></strong></p>
<p><em><a href="http://officemagazine.net/">Office</a></em> is the brainchild of Simon Rasmussen, the New York-based stylist who recently helped the Danish agency <a href="http://copenhagenagency.com/">Dyhr.Hagen</a> launch <em>FAT Man</em> magazine, and Jesper D. Lund, a creative director at Bergdorf Goodman. The debut issue of the hefty 13 1/4 x 9 3/4 -inch glossy fashion magazine has three covers, with photos from Marc Hom, Marcelo Krasilcic and Kira Bunse, and features work from Julia Noni, Asger Carlsen, Tom Allen, Jason Kibbler, Kathy Lo, Fumi Nagasaka and Dario Catellani. </p>
<p><strong><em><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/EclecticCover_s.jpg" /><br />
</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Eclectic </em></strong></p>
<p>A biannual art and fashion magazine based in the U.K., <em><a href="http://www.eclectic-magazine.com/">Eclectic</a></em> is run by Anna Barr and Charin Chong, who mix art projects and interviews with the standard fashion editorials. The most-recent third issue features photography from Lucilla Bellini, Robbert Jacobs, Samuel Colombo, Margaret Nowak, Corinne Stoll, Andrei Zozulya-Davidov, Lucio Aru &amp; Franco Erre, Isshogai, Hanako Whiteway, William Ferchichi, Sam Ssefa, Hubert Crabi&egrave;res, Rankin, Cary Fagan and C&eacute;dric Bonnard.</p>
<p><strong><em><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/AvenirCover_s.jpg" /><br />
</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Avenir </em></strong></p>
<p><em><a href="http://avenirmagazine.com/">Avenir</a> </em>(the French word for “future” and also the name of a typeface) is a quarterly art and culture magazine based in London. Issue 4 features a review of 2014 British graduate art school exhibitions, an editorial by Eli&ouml;ka Kyselkov&aacute; showcasing clothes designed by British fashion students, and photography from Louise Donohue, Zoe Lower, Charlotte Rutherford, Paul Franco and Jacob McFadden.</p>
<p><strong><em><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/GQStyleCOver_s.jpg" /><br />
</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>GQ Style </em></strong></p>
<p>A bi-annual fashion offshoot of the general-interest monthly, <em><a href="http://www.gq.com/style">GQ Style</a></em> is produced by <em>GQ’s</em> staff, and comprised mostly of pickup art as well as clothing still lifes from contributing photographers Josephine Schiele and Stuart Tyson. A single commissioned shoot—the Spring/Summer 2015 issue’s was shot by Tom Schirmacher—runs on the cover, and throughout the issue. </p>
<p><strong><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/TheGreatDiscontentCover_s.jpg" /><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://thegreatdiscontent.com/">The Great Discontent</a> </em></strong></p>
<p>Ryan &amp; Tina Essmaker raised more than $100,000 on Kickstarter to launch this quarterly culture magazine, composed mostly of interviews with creators. Ryan Lowry’s image of Tavi Gevinson from the debut issue was featured in April’s <em>PDN’s</em> 30 issue. Issue No. 2 features photography from Lowry, Eric Ryan Anderson, Amanda Jasnowski, Collin Hughes, Ren Rox, Clayton Cubitt, Catalina Kulczar, Amy Dickerson, Josh Goleman and Hannah Kristina Metz. </p>
<p><strong><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/SugarAndRiceCover_s.jpg" /><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://treadsack.com/sugarandrice/">Sugar &amp; Rice</a> </em></strong></p>
<p>This new Houston, Texas-based quarterly food magazine is run by formerly New York-based book editor David Leftwich and is backed by Down House, a local restaurant. Issue No. 2 features photography from Chance Hunter, Lou Vest, Debora Smail, Chuck Cook, Khalil AbuSharekh and Richard Knight.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The law firm largely responsible for helping photographer Daniel Morel win <a href="/exports/galleries/Judge-Upholds-12-M-11369.shtml">a $1.2 million jury award</a> for copyright infringement<span class="s1"><strong>—</strong></span>the maximum amount allowed by law<span class="s1"><strong>—</strong></span>spent more than twice that amount to prosecute Morel<span class="s1"><strong>’</strong></span>s case. And now, that law firm has to write off its costs as a loss.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">The reason is because a federal court has rejected a motion by Morel and his attorneys to recover $2.5 million in legal fees and costs incurred during his five-year copyright battle against Getty Images and AFP. The decision underscores the high costs<span class="s1"><strong>—</strong></span>and disincentive<span class="s1"><strong>—</strong></span>of pursuing copyright infringers.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Morel won the $1.2 million damage award in 2013 for willful infringement by the two photo agencies of eight of his images of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher, the law firm that tried Morel</span><span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s2">s case on a contingency basis, will get 15 percent of the jury award. But that amount</span><span class="s3"><strong>—</strong></span><span class="s2">less than $200,000</span><span class="s3"><strong>—</strong></span><span class="s2">doesn</span><span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s2">t come close to covering the firm</span><span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s2">s fees and costs.</span></p>
<p class="p2">In addition, the court ruled that Morel owes $164,583 in legal fees and expenses to Barbara Hoffman, the attorney who originally represented him in the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>“</strong></span>Morel fought a fair fight and won. The fact that this was a close case on the merits, involving novel legal issues, persuades the Court that the purposes of the Copyright Act are not furthered by awarding [attorneys<span class="s1"><strong>’</strong></span>] fees and costs,<span class="s1"><strong>”</strong></span> Judge Alison J. Nathan of the U.S. District Court in New York City wrote in her decision rejecting Morel<span class="s1"><strong>’</strong></span>s request.</p>
<p class="p2">Nathan explained in her decision that the <span class="s1"><strong>“</strong></span>interests of the Copyright Act are furthered by encouraging the raising of objectively reasonable claims and defenses, which may serve not only to deter infringement but also to ensure that the boundaries of copyright law [are] demarcated as clearly as possible.<span class="s1"><strong>”</strong></span> For that reason, she added, <span class="s1"><strong>“</strong></span>district courts are disinclined to award fees in cases that are close calls or which present novel legal issues or theories.<span class="s1"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Morel had asserted that the defenses of Getty and AFP were </span><span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s2">objectively unreasonable</span><span class="s3"><strong>”—</strong></span><span class="s2">the standard for awarding fees and costs to the prevailing party in civil cases. The judge disagreed. </span><span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s2">Morel primarily objects to Getty and AFP</span><span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s2">s litigation tactics,</span><span class="s3"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s2"> which had little to do with the merits of their legal arguments, the judge wrote in her decision. She added that the legal arguments of AFP and Getty </span><span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s2">were objectively reasonable.</span><span class="s3"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2">Moreover, the court said, the defenses <span class="s1"><strong>“</strong></span>raised a relatively novel issue<span class="s1"><strong>”</strong></span> and <span class="s1"><strong>“</strong></span>helped define the contours of copyright law in the digital age<span class="s1"><strong>”</strong></span> by testing the application of copyright law to social media. (Morel<span class="s1"><strong>’</strong></span>s images were copied and distributed without Morel<span class="s1"><strong>’</strong></span>s permission after he posted them on Twitter, and the question of infringement in the case turned in part on the language of Twitter<span class="s1"><strong>’</strong></span>s terms of service.)</p>
<p class="p2">Morel had sought $2,357,608 in attorney<span class="s1"><strong>’</strong></span>s fees for 3,829.5 hours of work performed by Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher between May 2011 and September 2014. He sought an additional $33,698 in fees fronted by the law firm for work performed by outside legal consultants, plus $166,688 in legal costs. That included $74,745 in costs incurred by the Hoffman Law Firm, which represented Morel from March, 2010 until February 2013, when Hoffman was, according to the court ruling, discharged without cause.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">When he took the case, Joseph Baio of Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher says he knew Morel wouldn</span><span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s2">t be able to pay the legal costs. Baio also anticipated the risk of not being able to recover costs from the defendants, even if Morel eventually won a decisive victory. That</span><span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s2">s because the principle of forcing losing parties to pay the winner</span><span class="s3"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s2">s legal costs </span><span class="s3"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s2">is alien to the system</span><span class="s3"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s2"> of U.S. law, he says.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Moreover, Baio says, the costs of pursuing copyright claims<span class="s1"><strong>—</strong></span>especially against well-funded opponents<span class="s1"><strong>—</strong></span>can far exceed the maximum damages that plaintiffs can recover under the law. So attorneys can never count on contingency fees to cover their costs.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Sara Terry, photographer founder of the Aftermath Project and a professional grant writer, estimates she has won grants totaling nearly $1 million over the last 15 years. PDN recently asked her for her practical tips and advice for successful grant writing. <strong><br />
<br />
PDN:</strong> Are there good resources for identifying available grants for photographers?<br />
<strong>Sara Terry:</strong> Every once in a while you see someone post a list of available grants. You can Google "grants available for photographers" and one of those lists will pop up. I just discovered the Ernest Cole Award in South Africa that way.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN:</strong> Do you follow any kind of roadmap when applying for grants? Can you break it down into manageable steps?<br />
<strong>ST:</strong> Number one, research the grant you think you want to apply for. Carefully read the website and the FAQ page. Look at who has won it before. Read very carefully the application questions, and figure out what they want to fund. Is it a year-long grant? Are they giving you cues that there's a specific hook to this grant? That's where you start.<br />
<br />
Then you need to understand what makes your project different, and what makes it worthy. What do you think is going to grab somebody's attention about it? It could be that nobody has done it. It could be a historically overlooked issue. You may have a personal connection to it. I'm thinking of Jessica Hines, who has been a finalist for the Aftermath Grant. <a href="http://jessicahines.com/my-brothers-war--all-chapters">Her work is about her brother</a>, who was a Vietnam vet who committed suicide. <br />
<br />
If you're not a good writer, give yourself a week to write the heart of your application—your statement—and then share it and get feedback on it. I think the next step would be to select the photos that you want to support it, and then have people check that edit for you. That's the order I would do it in.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN:</strong> How do you determine if a grant is a good fit for the work you do? <br />
<strong>ST:&nbsp;</strong> You have to understand that a grant has a specific purpose, mission or intent.&nbsp; You need to read carefully what the mission statement is. Aftermath Project has a mission in documenting post-conflict stories, and an outcome—a book. I make those things clear, but I get applications every year from people who propose environmental aftermath stories, or from people who try to twist the meaning of conflict to fit their own agenda, for instance, [saying] domestic violence is post-conflict. I guarantee you any funder with a specific mission statement will look at that and disqualify it. <br />
<br />
<strong>PDN:</strong> What are other common reasons applicants get disqualified or rejected?<br />
<strong>ST:</strong> I think a lot of people have never had anyone take a critical look at their work and say, “You are not up to par here.” <br />
<br />
A really important thing to do is go back in and look at what [the grant sponsor has] already funded. With the [Dorothea Lange–Paul Taylor Prize], it looked like an unwritten rule that if a national project won, you wouldn't win with a national project the following year [because] for many years, the awards went national, international, national, international.<br />
<br />
With Aftermath Project, we're not going to give a $20,000 grant for the same project that won the previous year. We have a limited landscape, and limited finances, and we're trying to draw a big picture. So if last year's winner was Stanley Greene on Chechnya, we won't give another grant for a project on Chechnya.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: </strong>When you're trying to figure out what projects an organization wants to fund, what other cues do you look for?<br />
<strong>ST:</strong> I got [The Alicia Patterson Foundation Fellowship Award] for work in Bosnia in 2005, I think. I read the Alicia Patterson guidelines. They so clearly stated they wanted to support production of journalism stories, so that's what I wrote, and I won. It was the wording I used to make sure I was meeting their interest. You have to incorporate it so you're not just parroting what they want. It takes some thinking, and maybe talking to someone who has won the grant before, if you know somebody.<br />
<br />
There are little tricks. The Guggenheim Foundation doesn't tell you why you won, but they want to feel like they're supporting you at a pivotal point in your career, and almost all the writing I've seen for Guggenheim fellowships reflected a measure of confidence on the part of the photographers—a sense of self-awareness, and why the work mattered. There was Robert Frank's legendary one-pager [application]. <br />
<br />
Sometimes people pitch [projects on grant applications] as a photojournalism assignment, but you look at that and go, “You could get that done in a month. And you want a grant for a year?” It's not going to happen. <br />
<br />
<strong>PDN:</strong> It sounds like you can look at past winners of different grants, and reverse engineer the winning applications? <br />
<strong>ST:</strong> It's something you can do. You would look for patterns of what's been awarded, and look at what they've funded in recent years. With Guggenheim, you can look up who's won, and try to find their project work online. And you can maybe look for what the photographer has written about that work, and how they've framed it, to give you a sense of their individual thinking. You’re never going to see a Guggenheim grant application [online because] it's very private. We do publish the [application] statements that come in with our winning grants [for Aftermath Project], so you can see how grant winners and finalists framed their stories. But you've got to learn as much as you can, and then you have to free yourself from thinking you have to copy anybody, because that won't work.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN:</strong> What tips do you have for writing the grant application?<br />
<strong>ST:</strong> If you're not a good writer, I think it's really important to find a friend who is a good writer—preferably a journalist. Your project statement should have, fairly high up, a succinct sense of what it is you want to do and why it matters. If you’re a really good writer, you can probably get people to wander with you for three or four paragraphs, before you get to [what you want to do and why it matters.] But if it sounds like a college history assignment, and you talk about the history of the civil war in Sri Lanka, you've wasted half of your up-front pitch talking about the past, and not about what you're going to do. In the end, the photos and the written statement are equal. You're not going to get through with strong photos and a lousy proposal.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN:</strong> Do have any other tips for writing that proposal?<br />
<strong>ST:</strong> I think one of the best tips ever given to me as a writer was: If you have just been to an event, or if something just happened, and you picked up the phone and called your grandmother, what's the first thing you would tell her about what you just saw? You're not writing for Congressmen or bankers. You want to be able to communicate in a clear and dynamic way to someone you care about. That's an amazing writing tip, in terms of keeping it conversational, intelligible, dynamic and human.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN:</strong> That applies to grant-writing, too?<br />
<strong>ST:</strong> Yeah, you don't want to quote a Doctors Without Borders report for the first couple of paragraphs. You might cite reports and statistics. But a really well-written, successful grant application—at least for the types of grants we're talking about—just has a compelling conversational quality to it. Not an academic quality. <br />
<br />
The other thing that gets noticed is whether your story is unusual. Every year I write a letter saying [to potential applicants], "This is what's interesting to us this year." And at the end, before the grant is announced, I write a letter to all of the applicants with notes about how the judging went, so they get a general sense of things that worked or didn't work. <br />
<br />
<strong>PDN:</strong> What's an example of something you said?<br />
<strong>ST:</strong> It's so interesting how trends develop. Like right now, that whole object-as-storytelling thing that Glenna Gordon did so beautifully with objects [that kidnap victims] brought back from captivity, and with her project called <a href="http://www.glennagordon.com/documentary-work/abducted-nigerian-school-girls/">Abducted Nigerian School Girls</a>; all of the sudden everybody's [photographing] objects [as stories]. That's going to become like beating a dead horse pretty soon. There was a period of time [three or four years ago] when everybody tried to tell news stories through portraits. And I would write to people and say, we had so many proposals [for that type of story], and they just weren't strong enough. <br />
<br />
<strong>PDN:</strong> We so often hear from jurors that people try to imitate what won previously. <br />
<strong>ST:</strong> Somebody gets recognized, and immediately everybody adopts that style. Know what's been awarded, but don't copy it, because that's really boring. Amplify it or go do something new. <br />
<br />
<strong>PDN:</strong> Can you solicit feedback if you don't win? Can you call afterwards?<br />
<strong>ST:</strong> If they say do not call, DO NOT call. They've said they don't want to hear from you.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN:</strong> What if you know a juror? Is it kosher to ask where you fell short, or how your application could have been better? <br />
<strong>ST:</strong> Not really. It depends. At Aftermath Project, we don't have the manpower for feedback. You don't have headspace for 180 applications in your mind. None of my friends have ever asked why they didn't get that Aftermath grant. They respect those boundaries. But we don't prohibit judges from talking to applicants. You might ask a juror if you know them. But if the funder says no feedback, that's it.<br />

<p >
<br />
I would make a really important point: If an applicant is fortunate to have communication from grantor, like a feedback note, like, "You're not framing it in a way that fits our goals," you want to be respectful and appreciative. You do not want to argue with the grantor about what it is they're doing, or how they see the issue that they are funding. You snap to and be appreciative that someone tried to give you a helping hand. [Don't] get defensive and argumentative.<br />

    <article_text><![CDATA[In this month’s interview with <a href="http://roadsandkingdoms.com/author/nthornburgh/">Nathan Thornburgh</a> (<a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/Nathan-Thornburgh-on-What-Makes-His-Online-Magazine-Roads-Kingdoms-Unique-13535.shtml">“The High Roads,” page 42</a>), the co-founder of Roads &amp; Kingdoms says his favorite collaboration with a photographer was the story he and Michael Magers did in 2013, when they traveled to Santiago, Chile. The pair followed photojournalist <a href="http://www.davidburnett.com/">David Burnett</a> as he looked for the places and people he had photographed immediately after the country’s military coup in 1973. Magers recalls that Thornburgh asked him to follow Burnett “and to be his shadow.” Says Magers, “It was a treasure hunt through Santiago to find people and places he had photographed during the coup, and it was quite emotional for Dave at times as well, to be connecting with these subjects.” Burnett photographed the tearful reunion of two women who had not seen each other since they were teenagers, when Burnett had photographed them mourning at the funeral of poet Pablo Neruda just days after the coup. He also photographed people who had been rounded up by the military in the days after General Augusto Pinochet seized power. 
<p>As Burnett hurried through the city, he attracted attention wherever he went thanks to the gear he hustled along with him, including an old Pacemaker Speed Graphic on a tripod, several other cameras, and a holster-like fanny pack he has customized to carry the Speed Graphic’s film holders. “It was a combination of madcap caper and serious subject matter,” Magers says. Hunting for a location, Burnett would stop people on the street, show them his old photos and ask for directions. “As soon as you talked to someone about it, you might find yourself in an hour-long conversation,” says Magers. Chile was in the midst of hotly contested presidential race among three candidates whose fathers had been key players on both sides of the political battles of 1973. The wounds of that period still felt raw, Magers notes. A documentary series airing each night on Chilevisi&oacute;n featured previously unseen footage and images of the bloody coup. </p>
<p>Many people were surprised to meet the photographer who had taken the photo that came to symbolize the dictatorship’s abuses. In the notorious soccer stadium where thousands had been detained and tortured, Burnett had captured the frightened gaze of a young man—his name, Burnett later learned, was Daniel C&eacute;spedes—in a group of prisoners being corralled by soldiers with guns. Burnett and another American photographer, Bob Sherman, had been arrested trying to take photos in the stadium; they were held at gunpoint for two hours. Moments after they were released, Burnett caught sight of the prisoners and captured his famous frame, which was later published in Paris Match. C&eacute;spedes was eventually released—possibly because of the international attention the photo brought him. </p>
<p>A section of the stadium has been preserved as a memorial. There, Magers took Burnett’s portrait. “What I saw was the past rushing into him and over him,” Magers says. “There was a great solemnity to it all, and a feeling of loss.” </p>
<p>Magers says of watching Burnett interact with his subjects, “For me, it was just an incredible experience to see how he works, and what a great guy he is.”</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<em>Audubon Magazine</em> is the bi-monthly publication of National Audubon Society, an organization dedicated to conserving and restoring natural ecosystems, with particular focus on the habitats of birds and other wildlife. Since January 2014, Sabine Meyer has served as the society's photography director, overseeing photography in <em>Audubon Magazine</em> and on the NAS web portal. She was previously director of photography at <em>National Geographic Adventure</em>, and has held photo editing positions at several other magazines, including <em>New York Magazine</em> and <em>Conde Nast Traveler.&nbsp; </em>Meyer, who recently worked with photographer Greg Kahn on a story about <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/A-Photographer-Explores-Climate-Change-on-North-Carolina-s-Outer-Banks-14028.shtml">climate change affecting the Outer Banks</a>, talked to <em>PDN </em>about how she assigns photo essays and portraits for its coverage of nature, the environment, and conservation.<em><br />
</em><br />
<strong>PDN: What are you looking for in the photographers you hire?</strong><br />
<strong>SM:</strong>&nbsp; I have portraits, landscapes, and stories that blend ecology and science. We often have stories that blend science and ornithology, so of course I need [photographers] who can photograph birds, who know about the proper ethical handling of bird photography and how to handle wildlife and how to work with researchers. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: What are you looking for esthetically? Is there anything in particular you favor?</strong><br />
<strong>SM:</strong> I don't know there's anything I favor, but my creative director and I (Kevin Fisher) are trying to move toward documentary and wildlife photography mixed in with a slightly fine-art approach.&nbsp; For instance, Camille Seaman does beautiful landscapes and climate change stories with wildlife in her pictures.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: Who are some other photographers you've hired recently?</strong><br />
<strong>SM: </strong>I hired Jon Lowenstein last fall to do <a href="https://www.audubon.org/magazine/july-august-2014/duck-dynasty">a story on a group of hunters/duck chasers</a> in the Dakotas. We did a story [for the January-February 2015] on the soon-to-be-dug-out Nicaragua canal. <a href="http://www.audubon.org/magazine/january-february-2015/a-very-bad-plan">Ivan Kashinsky did that story for us</a>. He's not specifically a bird photographer, but he does tackle environmental issues. Richard Barnes, who does architecture, <a href="https://www.audubon.org/magazine/july-august-2015/skeleton-crew-bones-and-bodies-behind-risds">just did a project for us</a> about the Rhode Island School of Design.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: Do you have particular examples of photographers who have recently delivered on assignments way beyond your expectations? What did that do that impressed you?</strong><br />
<strong>SM:</strong> Tristan Spinski went to a very&nbsp;remote&nbsp;atoll in&nbsp;the South Pacific to cover "crazy ants," which spray acid on birds, and the team from US Fish and&nbsp;Wildlife&nbsp;&nbsp;that works on eradicating the ants.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.audubon.org/magazine/july-august-2015/one-remote-islands-battle-against-acid">Tristan shot photos and videos</a>&nbsp;of the work and daily life on the atoll, but also set&nbsp;up a mini studio with white&nbsp; and black backdrops to shoot "portraits" of the ants as well as the birds, which we ended up using in the magazine throughout the story.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Last year, <a href="https://www.audubon.org/magazine/july-august-2015/jailbird-parrots-return-wildas-fugitives">Tom Fowlks photographed Brooke Durham</a>, who rehabs parrots in southern California. Tom impressed us by coming back with reportage, portraits, a cover and a series of mini still lifes (of the tools used to rehab the parrots), all executed beautifully and produced in a super clean and super&nbsp;graphic way which really pushed the&nbsp;envelope for us on how we can approach bird photography.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: Where do you find photographers? What's your best source of leads?</strong><br />
<strong>SM: </strong>Everything. There's my own personal rolodex, photo blogs, the world of photographers in the conservation arena. I look at photographers who belong to the International League of Conservation Photographers. I look at the group of photographers who shoot for National Geographic. <br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: What are the photo blogs that you mention?</strong><br />
SM: Lens, Lightbox, BJP, Rob Haggert's blog, Conscientious. Those are the big ones I pay attention to.<br />
<strong><br />
PDN: Do you ever give assignments to emerging photographers? If so, who are recent examples?</strong><br />
<strong>SM: </strong>Connor Stefanison is a young wildlife shooter based in British Columbia. We&nbsp;published some of his images of loons&nbsp;on our site, then <a href="https://www.audubon.org/magazine/january-february-2015/pulling-north-americas-loons-back-brink">an assignment came down to shoot loon scientists</a> in the field in Montana. Connor also just graduated with a&nbsp;degree in&nbsp;ecology,&nbsp;conservation and evolution,&nbsp;which made him the perfect match for this job. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;My colleague Mike Fernandez met Esther Horvath&nbsp;this year at the International Center of Photography's career day. Her work on Kemp's Ridley sea&nbsp;turtles really impressed us. We got the opportunity to send a photographer to the Arctic on a US Coast Guard ship for two weeks to report on their&nbsp;work collecting&nbsp;oceanographic data and we jumped at&nbsp;the&nbsp;opportunity to get Esther on the ship to shoot photos, videos,&nbsp;and also post on&nbsp;Instagram for us. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: Do you follow anyone on Instagram or other social media? Who has your attention right now?<br />
SM: </strong>Right now I'm following Matt Black, because the work he's doing is of high interest. I loved his California [drought] project in black and white. Clearly the drought is affecting the habitat of birds, so I look at his pictures. And I follow all the National Geographic photographers. <br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: Whose self-promo have you kept in the last month, and why?<br />
SM: </strong>I don't get a ton of mailers. But Matt Slaby of Luceo Images sent me a fun marketing kit, "Break this glass in emergency for creative call." We have worked together before. That's on my radar. <br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: What's the best way for photographers to get meetings with you?</strong><br />
<strong>SM:</strong> The first thing to do is probably to send me an e-mail with work that falls in line with what Audubon does. It doesn't have to have birds, but portraits, landscapes, habitats, photojournalism--everything we do. I don't have a ton of time for meetings. I tend to spend more time looking at portfolios online. <br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: If you could tell photographers in advance how best to present their work to you, what instructions would you give them? </strong><br />
<strong>SM: </strong>Show me stories. Unless you're a portrait photographer, I'm not interested in individual images. Show me stories that have a long narrative arc. Show me some personal projects. Show me things that touch on environment, conservation, wildlife, social issues--domestic or international. It's perfectly acceptable to show the work on an iPad or a laptop as a slideshow.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: Are you judging the photographers you hire on factors other than the quality of their work? </strong><br />
<strong>SM: </strong>Yes. If I hire photographers to go into the field and represent the National Audubon Society, I'm looking for people who understand that there are some very particular rules about photographing wildlife. If a researcher says you can't get close to that bird because it's going to affect the nest and the baby birds, you've got to stop and not do it. And I'm looking for photographers who understand how a story is built.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: What's the line for you between a photographer helpfully staying in touch and a photographer annoying you too much?</strong><br />
<strong>SM:</strong> Send an e-mail to say, "Hey, look at my work," and if I really like the work, I will answer, even if it takes me two weeks. If after two e-mails I haven't answered it's because there's no interest. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The other thing that's critical for me, is we re-launched a website in January that's content rich, with lots of room for photos and photo galleries. We're constantly looking for content, so someone who has a project that's ready to go, and it's content we're interested in, I'm happy to look at it. Often that's the first step [toward] an assignment for the photographer.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: Which photographers have graduated from contributing existing work to landing assignments?</strong><br />
<strong>SM: </strong>Gerrit&nbsp;Vin&nbsp;is a very seasoned&nbsp;wildlife shooter. We have been publishing a lot of his photos on our&nbsp;site and&nbsp;in our&nbsp;magazine and annual reports over the years. I had a shoot in Alaska,&nbsp;photographing Gyrfalcons in&nbsp;nests and tagging along with scientists&nbsp;studying them— Gerrit&nbsp;&nbsp;was the obvious&nbsp;choice&nbsp;for&nbsp;this&nbsp;project as he had been in Alaska previously shooting Gyrfalcons.&nbsp;The&nbsp;story is scheduled to be published in 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Greg Kahn's 3 Millimeters project on our&nbsp;Climate Change site <a href="http://www.audubon.org/magazine/march-april-2015/slip-sliding-away">led to an assignmen</a>t documenting the&nbsp; effects of climate change in the Outer Banks.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: Is there anything that you think photographers don't understand about how you work, that would be helpful to you if they understood?</strong><br />
<strong>SM: </strong>I think what's important to us is the fact that going on assignment requires a lot of different skills and a keen journalistic mind. I'm after the esthetic, too, but I'm looking for people who are journalists.<br />
<br />
<strong>PDN: Do you have any pet peeves about photographers, and if so, what? </strong><br />
SM: Yes. [Poor] captions. [You have to include] detailed, accurate captions in the metadata of the photos when they're delivered. Too often I get a set of images, and the captions aren't detailed. We live in a world of particular bird species. We need to know what species the bird is, we need to know where [it was photographed], we need to know the circumstance, we need to know when it was photographed. it seems very basic. But it's one of my biggest pet peeves.<br />

    <article_text><![CDATA[The world of fine-art photography has its own vocabulary, and its own methods for assessing value and price. To better understand the workings of the fine-art market and how it's changing, <em>PDN</em> has interviewed numerous gallery directors, private dealers and collectors, and also talked to photographers who have succeeded at selling their prints themselves. Their advice, gleaned from articles in <em>PDN</em>’s archives, provides a guide for photographers trying to navigate the market for fine-art prints. <em><br />
These articles are available to</em> PDN <em>subscribers</em>. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong><a href="/exports/galleries/A-Guide-to-Pricing-Y-8524.shtml">A Guide to Pricing Your Prints</a> </strong><br />
Gallery owners agree: You can always raise prices, but you can never lower them. In addition to pricing their work too high before they’re established, emerging artists make the mistake of issuing editions that are too large. Keeping editions small—ideally six prints or fewer, she says—is increasingly important, as more contemporary art collectors used to investing in one-of-a-kind paintings begin collecting photographs. “I beg artists to issue one edition of three to five,” says New York gallery owner Andrea Meisin.<br />
Raising your prices depends on many factors, gallerists say, including not only how well your prints have sold, but who has bought them. <br />
<br />
<a href="/exports/galleries/What-Does-Limited-Ed-5916.shtml">What Does "Limited Edition" Really Mean?</a> &nbsp;<br />
Twenty years ago, an edition of less than 20 prints was rare; now galleries rarely sell work by a photographer who prints in editions of more than ten. Collectors expect that the photographic prints they acquire remain scarce so they hold their value. But many photographers have issued new editions at a later date in larger sizes, or using different print processes, or both: Sometimes it’s for creative reasons, but often it is to cash in on the rising value of a work for which the existing limited-edition prints have sold out. New York, California and other states have statutes defining a “limited edition” and restricting what a photographer can do to capitalize on a single image. Philadelphia-based photography dealer Alex Novak, for one, minces no words. “Whether it’s illegal or not, it’s unethical” to issue new editions that previous buyers had no warning might be created, he says. “It hurts the people you’ve sold to previously.” And photographers hurt themselves by diluting the market value of their work and their name. <br />
<br />
<strong><a href="/exports/galleries/Managing-Your-Invent-11241.shtml">Managing Your Inventory of Limited-Edition Prints</a></strong><br />
By limiting editions, artists also limit the inventory they can sell. When the last print in an edition sells, “You can’t just print one for posterity,” says private dealer Lee Marks of Lee Marks Fine Art. Whether to sell or to save for the future—when you may need equity, or give it to an institution or heir—is a highly personal decision each photographer PDN interviewed considered differently, depending on their career, their prospects and their view of their legacy. <br />
Managing your inventory also depends on accurate record-keeping. That's particularly important for dealers who use stepped pricing: In an edition of ten, for example, prints 1 through 3 sell for the lowest price and numbers 4 through 6 cost more, up through the last print. Keeping accurate records about how many prints they’ve sold, given away, or lent for an exhibition is essential for every photographer to prevent pricing mistakes—such as selling the fourth print at the third print’s price. “If someone calls and says, ‘I like this image. Where is it in the edition?’ we know,” says Michael Foley of Foley Gallery. <br />
<br />
<strong><a href="/exports/galleries/What-To-Expect-From--11125.shtml">What to Expect from the Photographer/Gallery Relationship</a></strong><br />
Who pays for production, promotion, shipping? What exactly does “exclusivity” or “consignment” mean? “A written document is essential,” insists noted photography consultant Mary Virginia Swanson, author of “Finding Your Audience: A Guide to Marketing Your Photographs.” “Many galleries don’t use one, so artists need to sit down with a dealer if they don’t provide a contract to discuss what the expectations are.” <br />
Dealers, photographers and gallery owners discuss some of the terms to be negotiated-- and explain where misunderstandings commonly occur. <br />
<br />
<strong><a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/What-Collectors-Want-2986.shtml">What Collectors Want</a><br />
</strong>PDN interviewed five veteran photo collectors to tell us about the print they bought most recently, and where they look for new work. We also asked them how much they are influenced by edition size, print size, price, or the reputation of the artist or the artist's gallery. Their opinions on these criteria&nbsp; were as individual as the collectors themselves. <strong><br />
<br />
<a href="/exports/galleries/How-to-Sell-Your-Pho-8642.shtml">How To Sell Your Work Direct to Collectors</a></strong><br />
Photographers who choose to sell prints on their own—without the help of gallery representation—can face some wariness from collectors. However, by prudently promoting their work to select collectors and institutions, building a network of supporters and being professional about their pricing and record-keeping, several artists PDN interviewed said they have been successful at marketing their prints privately. It occupies a lot of time, however, and balancing selling one’s work with creating new work can be very difficult. “There are times when I get completely frustrated that I haven’t made anything and I just get fed up with it,” says Lauren Henkin.<br />
&nbsp;<strong><br />
<a href="/exports/galleries/The-Growing-Market-f-12080.shtml">The Growing Market for Fine-Art Videos</a> &nbsp;</strong><br />
Technological developments are helping collectors get comfortable with the idea of purchasing video-based art. Buying video works no longer means committing to the installation of a bulky television or finding the space for a projector; video art and multimedia can now be displayed seamlessly on slim monitors hung cleanly on a wall. The photographers-turned-video artists PDN interviewed explain that
collectors of video work now include individuals, as well as large
institutions.<br />
<br />
Representing video artists like Gregory Scott has “completely expanded our market,” says Catherine Edelman who owns a gallery known for selling photography. These collectors are primarily collectors of contemporary art. "There is something about video that is so accessible today," adds Edelman. "We're all looking for that person who gets our heart going, and [video] is the one avenue that I'm definitely seeking." <br />
<br />
<strong><a href="/exports/galleries/Photo-Innovation-Se-9852.shtml">S[edition]: Selling Fine Art Photos for the Screen</a> </strong>&nbsp;<br />
As flat-screen televisions become more affordable, a relatively new company, S[edition], foresees collectors exhibiting their art on multiple screens displayed like sculpture and paintings in their homes. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
S[edition] collectors, who range from traditional fine-art collectors to art lovers who cannot afford the original art they flock to see in galleries and museums, are actually buying access to a computer code and the right to stream the encoded digital information on as many screens as they like.&nbsp; ]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[I<em>t’s easy to fantasize about the globetrotting life of a </em>National Geographic<em> photographer. It’s a different matter to live it, explains long-time </em>National Geographic<em> contributor Randy Olson, in this excerpt from Lessons in Great Photography (www.ThePhotoSociety.org/ebooks). <br />
<br />
</em>People have a fascination with travel and equate that with a glamorous lifestyle. Because National Geographic has been exploring the world for so long, our jobs are linked to that stereotype. When the former CEO of NG explains where he works and people say, “Oh are you a photographer?” And when he says he just runs the joint, they seem disappointed. Regardless of the stereotype, it is not glamorous. <br />
<br />
Three months in Sudan with no facilities greater than a bug net in someone’s courtyard and bucket baths being the only relief from 120–130&deg; heat is not my idea of fun. <br />
<br />
But... just recently I’ve understood that this job is an escape from the relative wealth, apathy, and pursuit of consumer goods of our culture. I’ve had many fixers in many different cultures explain that we are so wealthy we don’t need each other anymore and that they still need each other to survive. I am lucky to be out in the world. <br />
<br />
And there are moments I wouldn’t trade for anything. This job means you get on a plane, leave your comfy, little life. And when you land it always seems like the same third-world airport (in the dark) with the same fluorescent tubes at weird angles flickering on and off, ballasts almost dead, whining away into the night. <br />
<br />
When you step off the plane something is going to hit you: extreme heat, extreme cold, a certain smell or set of smells that lets you know you aren’t home anymore. Then you remember that wheels on bags don’t really work in some places as you try to roll your bag over broken chunks of concrete and rebar. It takes a while to get your bearings, but you adjust because wherever you go in the world there are people around you doing extraordinary work that they think is perfectly normal. <br />
<br />
Once you are inside an assignment, you adjust to whatever it is. It’s always the edges that are the most difficult. Trip logistics are usually difficult. I never know when I will encounter some Idi Amin-like character, screaming at me to put all 600 rolls of film (when I shot film) through some 1950s X-ray machine the size of a semi that looks like it was actually built for time travel or for Willy Wonka or something, and part of the machine is battered because when the belt stops moving they beat it with a stick to get it going. <br />
<br />
Usually by the next morning you’re excited to be in a new place and ready to get to work. But this first morning in Sudan I was greeted with this editorial in the local paper: <br />
<br />
Photography is Prohibited <br />
Dear Sudanese tourist, our country and its unique exotic beauty may entice you; you may elatedly walk about the Nile Avenue, attracted by nature and its grace, which is evident on the riverbank. A sinful hand of yours may then reach for the camera to take a snap of the breathtaking scene, having the Nile as a magnificent background. You must realize then that you have violated an officially impermissible action, that you intentionally and openly subject your own self to criminal interrogation. <br />
<br />
From the right angle, being paid to shoot pictures in 50 countries in 20+ years is the ultimate glamour job. But taking pictures for National Geographic is rarely glamorous. It is often awe-inspiring. It can be scary, life threatening, and, with many weeks spent on the road occasionally, lonely. <br />
<br />
The truth is that mostly I wait. For flights, the right light, official okays, for helpers to find one instant that will make a worthy photograph. From weather to accommodations, food, drink, and travel, my assignment conditions can be miserable. In the Acacia forest, I worked amid sand fleas, carriers of flesh-eating parasites whose greater flaw was transferring an often-fatal disease. <br />
<br />
On another assignment I accompanied a group of Russian explorers to the Siberian Arctic. To determine if nine people and many days’ worth of camping supplies were more than the helicopter could carry, the pilot hovered 5 feet above the ground. If we didn’t crash on the tarmac, we were good to fly.<em><br />

    <article_text><![CDATA[<a href="http://roadsandkingdoms.com/">Roads &amp; Kingdoms</a>, the independent online publication of travel, culture, politics, food and music, publishes feature stories from around the world and regularly highlights photographers working on international projects. Roads &amp; Kingdoms was founded by Nathan Thornburgh, a former foreign correspondent and editor at <em>TIME</em>, and Matt Goulding, who worked as a food editor for <em>Men’s Health</em>, is the co-author of a travel book and has contributed to several publications. The two met in 2008 in Mexico City. Thornburgh was there doing follow-up reporting after having been arrested and briefly jailed in Cuba; Goulding was writing an article titled <a href="https://au.lifestyle.yahoo.com/mens-health/a/6670787/there-are-no-nachos-in-mexico/">“There Are No Nachos in Mexico.”</a> Over a meal of goat tacos, they discussed ideas for a publication that would combine their talents and interests. After Thornburgh left <em>TIME</em> in 2011, the publication he and Goulding had imagined took shape as Roads &amp; Kingdoms.
<p>Thornburgh recently spoke with <em>PDN</em> about the publication’s work with photographers, the kind of pitches that interest him, and the magazine’s approach to surviving financially while caring more about storytelling than clicks.    </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What’s the editorial mission of Roads &amp; Kingdoms?</strong></p>
<p><strong>NT:</strong> It’s foreign correspondence but with a big, healthy dose of food, music, culture and photography. We want to make it interesting and more about life and the experience, with less of the dryness that sometimes comes from dutiful foreign coverage. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: And you and your co-founder Matt Goulding run it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>NT: </strong>We are the editorial founders. Our third partner is our designer, Douglas Hughmanick. Instead of taking on a business partner we took on a designer, which has been a great decision. We would undoubtedly be further along in our business development if we had taken on a business partner, but I think it’s important to who we are as a publication that we try to make it look as beautiful as possible. </p>
<p>In 2012 we had our soft launch on Tumblr, as Matt and I were testing out our voice. In 2013 we launched as a full magazine online. Since then, Medium and other long-form treatments have come along with a similar look, which is phenomenal; 2014 was a very good year for being pretty on the Internet. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: The pages have no sidebars, no links to related headlines. How does the design support your editorial mission?</strong></p>
<p><strong>NT:</strong> I think it’s important to have no distractions. We have great photographers who contribute, and you can do important work by making sure their work is front and center. You send a message to the reader that you care about these things.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Do your photographers also write?</strong></p>
<p><strong>NT:</strong> We are pretty loose when it comes to saying, “This is a photo essay” or “This is a story with photography.” For example, <a href="http://www.cengizyar.com/">Cengiz Yar</a> is a photographer who was in the Kurdish region of Syria. He wrote, I thought, a pretty brilliant 2,000-word piece. I’ve found photographers to be a little rawer, way more passionate, but willing to state an opinion and say to hell with what everyone else thinks. That’s a voice I’m attracted to, and for Roads &amp; Kingdoms, it works very well. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Roads &amp; Kingdoms isn’t a typical travel magazine. </strong></p>
<p><strong>NT: </strong>For me, travel is never the story; it’s what happens when you’re going after the story. It’s not the end; it’s the means. When we work with photographers and writers, we say: It’s not just that you’re in Sri Lanka. Tell us a story we haven’t heard before, and if you can explain Sri Lanka to us that way, that’s great. </p>
<p>I’m definitely not interested in travel for travel’s sake, and I’m not interested in news for news’ sake. When we wanted to talk about the security situation in Mogadishu a couple of years ago, we asked correspondents who were there to tell us about getting ice cream with the defense minister. There had been all these stories about Mogadishu getting back to normal, but of course [getting ice cream] took a convoy of four armed cars. That, to me, is how to tell a story like that, not with a fill-in-the-quote from a talking head. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you find correspondents and stories?</strong></p>
<p><strong>NT:</strong> When I was at <em>TIME</em>, I saw a lot of foreign bureaus shutting down, but not everyone went home. People are out there. Frankly, given our rates, we can’t pay for travel. Because of our fledgling business model, we pay everyone, but not enough to make a living. Correspondents have a story in their notebooks, or they’re working off a grant. I also really like it when we get local voices into Roads &amp; Kingdoms as well. It’s amazing to see the level of reporting and photography that’s out there. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: So most of the photographers and writers you’ve worked with seek you out? </strong></p>
<p><strong>NT: </strong>It’s rare these days to get edited. There’s such a crunch, and online editors don’t have time to spend making a story better. We’ve been approached by people who say, “Hey, I hear you guys edit.” If you’re a photographer trying to figure out the best way to show a subject, it can be great to have [an editor] to talk with. That’s why it can be great [for photographers] to have [director of photography] Pauline Eiferman helping them work through those things. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Can you give an example of a successful pitch?</strong></p>
<p><strong>NT: </strong>One photographer I have loved working with is <a href="http://www.eduardoleal.co.uk/">Eduardo Leal</a>, a young Portuguese photographer who’s very enterprising. When he was in Venezuela [in 2013], we talked about the country’s politics, and he said, “You wouldn’t believe the [Hugo] Ch&aacute;vez gear that people are rocking. People have got Hugo Ch&aacute;vez on their sunglasses.” We said yes, that’s how you cover politics, with a burst of color and energy. The story was called <a href="http://roadsandkingdoms.com/2013/chavez-chic/">“Ch&aacute;vez Chic.”</a></p>
<p>At <em>TIME</em> I got to work with some incredible photographers. It’s a privilege to work with someone like <a href="http://noorimages.com/photographer/kozyrev/">Yuri Kozyrev</a>. [For Roads &amp; Kingdoms] he and I traveled in Abkhazia, where there had been a resort area under the Soviet Union that got blown up about 20 years ago. He had the idea to show this apocalyptic landscape that was still a functioning resort. It was a great mix of a bizarre post-conflict world and a beach vacation experience. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.amandamustard.com/#0">Amanda Mustard</a> is great. We ran her piece on the pigeon coops of Cairo and she did a piece about the Umbrella Revolution in Hong Kong by embedding with protesters. We were lucky to publish it. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.andrewstanbridge.com/">Andrew Stanbridge</a> is a favorite. He was our first photographer on our Instagram feed. While he was in northern Burma, he shot a story about a drinking god that was great, and he did a story from S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe that was pegged to Martyr’s Day but was also exploring the idea of post-colonial African governances.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://roadsandkingdoms.com/2013/the-speed-graphic-returns/">single best photography piece</a> I’ve ever done…was when photographer <a href="http://www.mpmagers.com/">Michael Magers</a> and I went to report on the legendary [photographer] David Burnett’s return to find the subject of his famous 1973 Chilean coup picture.    </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What makes a good pitch?</strong></p>
<p><strong>NT: </strong>I want a very specific, narrow window into a larger problem. The smaller your focus is, the bigger the story you can tell. </p>
<p>We did a story about preachers of the prosperity gospel in Lagos. The number of people who do motivational speaking has just exploded. People in Lagos have envisioned a wealthier self and say God helped them get rich. It’s a great way of talking about Nigeria. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Why doesn’t Roads &amp; Kingdoms have any advertising?</strong></p>
<p><strong>NT: </strong>We don’t want to sell Google ads. We were lucky that when we started, display advertising rates were already in the tank. That made it an easy decision to choose design over serving ads. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you pay your bills?</strong></p>
<p><strong>NT: </strong>We have a studio model. We act as a creative agency for brands. We don’t have giant name recognition but we’re catching on. We can choose brands we like, and go out and do storytelling for them. Brands involved in food, travel, and cars have big audiences they need to feed content to. You can call it “branded content.” We’re taking what we do and producing it for them. Video is a huge part of that, because they’re interested in making the best video products that they can and they need help. We did a video series with Breville and director Kate Kunath that we’re really proud of.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: You also have content that appears on Slate. </strong></p>
<p><strong>NT:</strong> That’s an editorial partnership. We curate and edit the Friday dispatches for them. It’s great for them because it bolsters their international coverage and for us it’s great to have a distribution partner who is more established but sees the value in what we do. </p>
<p>We did a partnership with Sports Illustrated leading up to the World Cup in Rio. I loved the stories we did around the world. I like using football as a way to talk about the world. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: And you’re surviving? </strong></p>
<p><strong>NT:</strong> I’m the publisher as well as an editor, and I’m learning a lot about the business. </p>
<p>I want to build a publication that will sustain writers and photographers. I’m suspicious of the wave of tech money being invested in media. It gets you to scale really fast, but there are certain protocols you have to follow. We publish one story a day, and that’s antagonistic to the way you get to scale. Raising money from Silicon Valley investors is contingent on having an exit strategy: The idea is that you make your money and we’re all laughing on our boats in a few years. [But] we have no plan B. We purposely built a publication that we really like. I’m doing what I want to do. </p>
<p>I think the world is an amazing place. I’m interested in telling stories about the things that make the world better. We want to tell the story about people enjoying food and music. That’s the deeper moral for me.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Travel photography has always been about capturing the beauty and uniqueness of a locale. But there’s a new word in town: “experiential.” In tune with our social media-driven times, travel publications are looking for more personal, authentic travel stories. The emphasis is on down-to-earth reality, with stories containing environmental portraits of locals and funky close-up details alongside more typical landscapes and streetscapes. 
<p>“A lot of travel photography is well-conceived and lit, but there’s nothing insightful about it,” says Leila Courey, photo editor of Air Canada’s award-winning <em><a href="http://enroute.aircanada.com/">En Route</a></em> <a href="http://enroute.aircanada.com/">magazine</a>. “I like it when photographers are more voyeuristic, reacting to moments that are honest and genuine.” Tara Guertin, photo editor at <em><a href="http://www.afar.com/">AFAR</a></em>, a San Francisco-based travel magazine that launched in 2009, agrees, saying, “There should be a freshness there.”</p>
<p>Although they might have a looser and more authentic feel, the stories are still carefully planned and executed. After all, it requires good preparation, technique and interpersonal skills to capture life on the fly—or, as composer Stephen Sondheim once said, “To make art look effortless takes a lot of effort.” So how are photographers delivering the images that satisfy today’s travel editorial market?</p>
<p><strong>FIRST STEPS</strong></p>
<p>Guertin and Courey both say they prefer to have a story written first, if possible, but there are times when a photographer and writer might travel together. For example, Montreal-based photographer <a href="http://alexihobbs.com/">Alexi Hobbs</a> was hired by <em>AFAR</em> in 2011 to document travel writer Matt Gross’s reunion in Montreal with his estranged younger brother. “That’s hard, because the story is unfurling as you go and could be anything,” says Hobbs. “But it’s also fun because you get to discuss things with the writer.” </p>
<p>If the written story precedes the photography, the photo editor will typically give the photographer a shot list of places mentioned in the article, but also ask them to shoot around it. “I tell every photographer that I’m hiring them for their eye,” Courey says. “They’re the ones on the ground; they’re the ones who are going to find something interesting. If they’re sitting having coffee and the place looks great, shoot it—it will add to the story.”</p>
<p>Hobbs remembers departing from a shot list on an assignment for <em>En Route</em> about modernist architecture in Phoenix, Arizona. One day, he went for a walk in the desert and, coming across some cactus plants lit gold by the setting sun, shot them. “There’s just something about that image—the light and mood encapsulates the feeling of being there,” he says. Sure enough, the image was featured prominently in the article. </p>
<p>“Having the photographs match directly with the text doesn’t interest me,” says Courey, “but there’s usually something about the tone of a piece that a photographer can hone in on.”</p>
<p>“When I’m on location, I always re-read the story and refer to it,” says Los Angeles-based photographer <a href="http://www.amandamarsalis.com/">Amanda Marsalis</a>. However, she says, many travel stories these days are “intimate, first-person journey stories” that can’t be directly illustrated. That was the case for <a href="http://www.cntraveller.com/recommended/cities/merida-authentic-city-mexico">a story she shot in spring 2014 in Merida, Mexico</a>, for <em>Cond&eacute; Nast Traveller</em> (UK). “There wasn’t really a shot list with that story, they just wanted me to capture the essence of the place, which was terrific.”</p>
<p>Some photographers pitch stories too—but that usually doesn’t work, say the editors. Guertin estimates that writers pitch 80 percent of the stories in <em>AFAR</em>, while editors generate most of the remainder. Timing is a factor: A photographer might pitch a story about a place she’s visiting next month, but since travel magazines work about six months ahead, the seasonality won’t line up. But Courey says it’s not impossible. “Occasionally there’s a hole in the book, and we’re looking to fill it. A photographer’s pitch might work then.”</p>
<p>Along with their regular contributors, the editors look for newcomers: “I love working with young people getting started, because I think they give 150 percent,” Guertin says. She advises aspiring travel photographers to put a relevant image prominently in their emails to her. “Make the email short and sweet, and have an image up front. If it makes my heart palpitate, you’ll be bookmarked immediately.”</p>
<p><strong>HITTING THE GROUND</strong></p>
<p>Photographers who do their research get high marks. “It’s in your interest to do as much research as possible: the story will be better if you go to a place informed,” says Courey. Hobbs, who now shoots regularly for <em>AFAR</em> and <em>En Route</em>, says he always looks up a country’s history and culture, and looks at maps. “But I prefer not to look at photographs, so that I can arrive with fresh eyes,” he says</p>
<p>Hobbs, who typically travels alone, will go out walking soon after arriving at a destination. “If it’s a town or city, I try to hike up to a high spot to find a wider view—not just for a photograph, but to get my bearings and get to know the place,” he says. “It gives you a sense of where you are, where the sun rises and sets, what the sounds and smells are.” He also advises eating at the bar at local restaurants. “You’ll meet locals who’ll give you great tips,” he says.</p>
<p>Marsalis, who has shot travel stories for <em>GQ</em>, <em>Outside</em> and <em>Islands</em>, says she tries to absorb as much local culture as possible. “It’s about figuring out the essence of a place, conveying what it feels like to be enveloped in that place,” she says. When shooting her 2014 story on M&eacute;rida for <em>Cond&eacute; Nast Traveller</em> (UK), for example, she went to a Mezcal bar to hang out with locals, and returned with an intriguing, moody portrait of a local woman. </p>
<p>Of course, travel assignments can be unpredictable: The average trip lasts three to six days, involves multiple locations, and can be challenged by weather. Photographers<em> PDN</em> interviewed advised not burdening yourself with complicated gear (though Hobbs recommends taking three cameras—he once had two fail on a trip) and above all, anticipating worst-case scenarios. “If you get bad weather, you might need to spend a day shooting interiors, or wait until dusk, when the clouds can be pretty,” Marsalis says. </p>
<p>Hobbs remembers getting to Martinique in 2013, finding it not as photogenic as he’d imagined, and having to think outside the box. “If you walk around and keep looking, you can always find something,” he says. On one walk, he came across a man weaving a hat from palm fronds. “He was standing in an oasis of light, by the water—I stayed there for 40 minutes, until the sun set, then we went to grab a drink together.”</p>
<p>Both Hobbs and Marsalis say they often stay on after an assignment, to unwind and photograph for the client under less pressure. “I’ll often stay a couple more days on my own dime—usually, hotels will give you the same discount they gave the magazine,” Marsalis says. Hobbs, who has also lengthened trips, points out that the most charming shots often happen when you’re not actively searching for them. “It’s like when you’re single and really want a girlfriend or boyfriend and nothing happens—then as soon as you stop looking, one comes along!”</p>
<p><strong>KEEPING THE EDIT IN MIND</strong></p>
<p>Guertin and Courey say they don’t micro-manage a shoot, preferring to trust the photographer’s instincts and “not poke in,” as Guertin puts it. Sometimes, though, guidance can be helpful. When assigning Marsalis to shoot features on Los Angeles and Brooklyn, <em>GQ</em> photo editor Justin O’Neill says, “I requested that she edit as she went along, for the sake of maintaining cohesion.” He advises photographers to “keep in mind images and moments that have potential as ‘opener’ art [principal art featured on the title page of a story].” </p>
<p>“The imagery on the opening spread tends to be clean and graphic,” says Guertin. “After that, I want to see faces and details.” For Courey, it’s important to “story-tell in a way that has a human quality, that’s palatable and relatable.” </p>
<p>In the Internet age, that immediacy is important: travel magazines are competing with social media and sites like Airbnb. To deliver that immediacy, photographers should have an eye for the quirky environmental detail (“Let the design of the destination speak for itself,” says Courey), and a comfort level with approaching locals. “I can be shy about approaching people when I’m home, but I find it easy in other places,” says Hobbs. </p>
<p>Marsalis, who grew up flying the globe as the daughter of a pilot and a flight attendant, certainly believes in the power of the travel image. “Wherever I go, I try to keep the wanderer vibe alive,” she says. “If someone sees your story and decides to spend their money going to that place—and then if they get the experience they’re looking for, you’ve done your job.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Helen Rosner is the features editor at Eater.com, a food-centric website under the Vox Media umbrella. Since Eater’s site was re-launched in September 2014, she’s been commissioning features and original photography, producing image-heavy, longform stories and expanding the site’s coverage beyond day-to-day restaurant news, gossip and blogging.</p>
<p class="p3"><em>PDN</em> sat down with Rosner at Vox’s Manhattan headquarters to talk about what she looks for when choosing new photographers, the kinds of stories she likes getting pitched and the cliches she tries to avoid when assigning feature stories.</p>

The writer pitched it; he had worked with the photographer, Andrew Thomas Lee, before.</p>
<p class="p7">For quick reporting trips, I don<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>t always feel like it<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>s necessary for the writer and photographer to be there at the same time. But for something like this<span class="s6"><strong>—</strong></span>which was such an intimate story [about a chicken farmer producing <span class="s6"><strong>“</strong></span>ethical<span class="s6"><strong>”</strong></span> foie gras]<span class="s6"><strong>—</strong></span>Andy was clearly the right choice from the beginning. He<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>s a really experienced food photographer, but he also has a tremendous understanding of how to shoot in the field, and how to go on location and create something that feels very formal in a very natural space. For a story like this one that was about blood and guts, I really liked the idea of imposing Andy<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>s sense of visual formalism onto something that has a lot of built-in dynamism and grotesquery. </p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>:</strong></span><strong> How do you find photographers for remote locales?</strong></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s5"><strong>HR:</strong></span> If you go into Photoshelter and you do an advanced search, you can do it by city, state, and country. <span class="s6"><strong>“</strong></span>Ghosts in the Ham House<span class="s6"><strong>”</strong></span> is a profile of a woman who runs a country ham facility in Western Kentucky. And it was written by a Chicago-based writer, who was driving down from Chicago to report the story over the course of a couple of days. From a purely budgetary perspective, this isn<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>t something that required a three-day photo shoot. So I decided to see who I could find who was within 150 miles.</p>
<p class="p7">Through that, I found Rick Smith. I went through his portfolio and he had this incredible style that I thought was really interesting. We<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>re shooting a massive country ham curing facility, there<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>s a tremendous amount of inherent visual regularity to the way this works. The curing houses are just giant wooden structures with thousands and thousands of hams stacked on them, so there<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>s a lot of pattern, there<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>s a lot of repetition, and I really wanted to find a photographer who could speak to that, and do something that would feel abstracted and geometric. I had total faith in him as a photographer, and what he wound up doing worked really beautifully for the story, which was actually much more of a texture story than a pattern story. I didn<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>t want your standard <span class="s6"><strong>“</strong></span>here<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>s the shop, here<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>s the portrait.<span class="s6"><strong>”</strong></span> I wanted something that felt a little bit exciting or different. </p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>:</strong></span><strong> What makes a successful pitch from a photographer?</strong></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><strong>HR:</strong></span><span class="s3"> Melanie Dunea</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">s truffle-hunting story is a great example. Melanie is a very successful food and portrait photographer. We</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">ve known each other from the food world for a number of years, and she came to me with a pitch. She had shot this while she was on assignment for something else; this was a side trip for her. She went out with a truffle hunter and had this extraordinary experience, and got some really remarkable, very rarely seen, intimate access to the real world of truffle hunting. You know, your truffle is presented in a satin-lined box, it</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">s an incredible luxury, and she went out with this guy at five in the morning, in the dark, down this treacherous, weird, terrifying mountain valley, and it</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">s dirt and shit and gross and it was amazing. She pitched this to me as a complete package. All I had to do was negotiate the price and sit down with her to make selects. </span></p>
<p class="p7">What I<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>m particularly looking for is a narrative. It<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>s really easy to fall back on the frequently visited trope of <span class="s6"><strong>“</strong></span>one day in the life of X.<span class="s6"><strong>”</strong></span> Chronology is not the same as narrative.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>:</strong></span><strong> </strong><span class="s7"><strong>What kind of stories are you <em>not</em> looking for? </strong></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><strong>HR:</strong></span><span class="s3"> I get these day-in-the-life pitches, of a dishwasher, or a busboy. I think it</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">s really good to tell the stories of the people whose stories are not being told. We don</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">t need another set of photos following whatever celebrity chef who</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">s already being covered in 15 other magazines. But I also think that a dishwasher is not interesting just because he</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">s a dishwasher; I want there to be more than that. Why this guy, at this moment? I get a lot of pitches for travelogues, which are difficult for Eater, because we</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">re not a travel brand, we</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">re a food brand, and telling the story of travel through food is interesting, but it</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">s not a story. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>:</strong></span><strong> </strong><span class="s3"><strong>Any tips about pitching you stories if a photographer hasn’t worked with you before?</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s5"><strong>HR:</strong></span> What<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>s much easier for me to take with a new photographer would be an ongoing project. I don<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>t want to tip my hand too much to upcoming stories, but I have a really great photographer I<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>m working with who I have not worked with before who<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>s following a group of people over a multi-month process. The story is less dependent upon these gasp-inducing, perfect, beautiful, formalist shots. And it has a built-in chronology.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>:</strong></span><strong> Do writer/photographer teams often pitch you? Do you prefer to be pitched by a team?</strong></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s5"><strong>HR:</strong></span> I<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>ve had writers and photographers who have pitched me as a team before where I<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>ve had to do this very delicate work of saying, <span class="s6"><strong>“</strong></span>I really like this story but I think I want to take it in a different visual direction<span class="s6"><strong>…</strong></span>. Are you guys willing to break up?<span class="s6"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p7">When it comes to a story that the photography has to occur at the same time as the reporting, or the credentialing is just a giant pain in the ass, it can be very, very helpful for a writer to have a photographer lined up. And when it is something about exclusive access or having to have a source<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>s trust, that<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>s often a <span class="s6"><strong>“</strong></span>yes.<span class="s6"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>:</strong></span><strong> How do you vet new photographers?</strong></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><strong>HR:</strong></span><span class="s3"> It</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">s not like I run them through an algorithm. You look at the portfolio, but I</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">ve asked photographers before, </span><span class="s4"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="s3">I totally love these three selects that you showed me from this one story that you shot, do you have the full film?</span><span class="s4"><strong>”</strong></span><span class="s3"> It</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">s helpful for me to understand how much is this a photographer who isn</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">t just great at Photoshop and benefitted from great photo editors at great publications, but is a photographer who does his research ahead of time, really thinks about the shots ahead of time. I try not to be too micro-managey, but I also don</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">t want to be surprised when I see the film, and I don</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">t want the photographer to be surprised when they get my reaction to it. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>:</strong></span><strong> </strong><span class="s7"><strong>What does it take to fly someone to a location, as opposed to hiring a local? Budget?</strong></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s5"><strong>HR:</strong></span> I think it<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>s equal parts budget and style. I am a really big fan of using local photographers, not just because I save on travel costs, but because I think that frequently the same bylines show up again and again and again. And I love that I<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>m in a position to use my platform and my budget to elevate people who might not have shown up on the radars of other New York-based people assigning photography. It<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>s just sort of the visual <em>terroir</em>. If I<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>m telling a story that takes place in Western Kentucky, why not use a photographer that already knows the landscape? Who has that sense of intimacy, and who isn<span class="s6"><strong>’</strong></span>t going to fall back onto the visual tropes that you see when an outsider comes in and photographs a new place.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>:</strong></span><strong> Any specific goal for your site?</strong></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s5"><strong>HR:</strong></span> I just want really awesome photos. And I want to push the envelope a little bit. </p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>:</strong></span><strong> How do you do that?</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><strong>HR:</strong></span><span class="s3"> It depends a lot on the photographer. If there are photographers who are doing weird or cool or slightly skewed things, something different, I would love for them to come to me. I love this idea of helping amplify somebody who is getting started, or is late in their career but at the beginning of a new idea. We have a great platform. On Eater, we have 8 million readers a month, that</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">s a lot of eyeballs. We have amazing photographers on staff, who shoot the hamburger or shoot the restaurant interior. What I</span><span class="s4"><strong>’</strong></span><span class="s3">m basically looking for is either photojournalism or art, or both.</span></p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[When the emerging photographers selected for this year’s <em><a href="http://www.pdns30.com/gallery/2015/#grid">PDN</a></em><a href="http://www.pdns30.com/gallery/2015/#grid">’s 30</a> described the steps they took to launch their careers, many talked about the challenge of taking the first, crucial stride: They had to learn to believe in themselves before they could seek support from clients or mentors. <br />
<br />
“The only advice I really remember getting was from my uncle when I was quite young and started photographing. He gave me my first camera and told me plainly, ‘Do you want to be a photographer? Then you have to just keep making pictures,’” <a href="http:// http://www.pdns30.com/gallery/2015/#5-Antoine_Bruy">Antoine Bruy</a> recalls. “Perhaps simple, but it is something that I have always remembered.” <br />
<br />
Here, some of the <em>PDN</em>’s 30 photographers profiled in <em>PDN</em>’s April issue share other valuable lessons they learned—from colleagues, clients, friends or from their own experimentation—that helped them find their photographic voices and build support for their work.  <br />
<strong><br />
Seeking Advice – And Deciding What’s Worth Following</strong><br />
Many of the <em>PDN</em>’s 30 photographers have learned from peers, teachers, portfolio reviewers and advisors. “Having people critique your work over and over is one of the best things you can do for yourself as an artist,” says <a href="http://www.pdns30.com/gallery/2015/#27-Pascal_Shirley">Pascal Shirley</a>. “I feel a lot of people don’t ever get much critique and a lot of people are scared to give it. Having a place for this kind of dialogue is crucial in developing your photographic vocabulary.”<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.pdns30.com/gallery/2015/#8-Paul_Colangelo">Paul Colangelo,</a> who spends months working on projects, says his mentors have been invaluable not only for the advice they shared but the reassurance they offered about the difficulties photographers inevitably face. “One of the greatest challenges was working in the field on a long-term project when no one knows or cares that you’re there, you have no sponsors, no assignment. All you have is your belief in the story. No matter how strong that belief is, after living on a mountain for two months by yourself, you end up desperate for some support to go along with that belief. I have a mental list of photographers’ most desperate moments to keep me warm and reassured: Crying in a McDonald’s parking lot, your dream editor saying you’ll never make it as a photographer.” He explains, “These have happened to some of the best photographers of our time, and I’m grateful to know these stories.”<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.pdns30.com/gallery/2015/#14-Sara_Naomi_Lewkowicz">Sara Naomi Lewkowicz,</a> who says she's benefitted from the advice Donna Ferrato and other established photographers, notes, “It can be really hard to see people who have achieved so much in their careers and think, ‘How am I going to get there?’ You don’t. They’re at the top of the mountain. What you really need to do is to look 10 feet away, and get there in a few steps and then a couple more steps. You figure out your own path.” <br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.pdns30.com/gallery/2015/#21-Amanda_Mustard">Amanda Mustard</a> says that when she began to work as a photojournalist, she learned a lot from the guidance of more experienced photographers, and some helped her build connections; she tries to pay the favor forward.  “I got some of my first gigs because of contact or job referrals by generous, more established journalists, and I was incredibly grateful for that. In turn, I’ve always been open to my close colleagues and willing to share what I can, when I can. Freelancing is a constant hustle, and it takes the edge off if you’re looking out for each other’s backs.”  <br />
<br />
<strong>About Hustling Your Work</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.pdns30.com/gallery/2015/#12-Malin_Fezehai">Malin Fezehai</a> observes that seeking assignments takes gumption. “What you should be asking yourself is if you should be doing this, and if you should, then you should be doing it,” she says. After shooting photos for NGOs, traveling, and working in a lab, Fezehai took two years off from photography. <br />
<br />
“Then just something snapped in me that said: ‘You know, you have to go out and ask people for work.’ Before that, I was holding myself back. I think some women do this thing of, ‘Here are my pictures and I’m sorry I’m alive,’ while some of my male colleagues are like, ‘I’m a fantastic photographer. Look at me.’ Learning from them a bit was helpful. I think the main thing is to own what you do. People talk about entitlement as if it’s a bad thing, but I think it’s something everyone should have.”<br />
<br />
Mustard observes, “I’ve always believed that if you’re hitting the pavement and pushing forward hard, something will come of it. And when the inevitable kick-to-the-groin will and does happen, whether it be a harsh review or assignment gone wrong, always be ready to pull something constructive out of it and move forward.”<br />
<br />
In February 2013, the long-term project Lewkowicz had shot while at Ohio University, on a couple named Maggie and Shane, was published on <em>TIME</em> Lightbox, under the headline, “Photographer as Witness: A Portrait of Domestic Violence.” The project later won Lewkowicz the 2013 Ville de Perpignan Remi Ochlik Award, but the post on Lightbox put her in the center of controversy about her role in witnessing, rather than intervening in, an incident of domestic abuse. The lesson Lewkowicz learned: “Never read the comments. Ignore the comments. When you make work and put it out there, you lose a degree of control, and control over how it’s perceived. It’s frustrating because your work is so personal to you.”<br />
<br />
<strong>Finding an Audience</strong><br />
Fezehai, who shares selected images from her projects and assignments both on <a href="http://pdnpulse.pdnonline.com/2015/04/follow-the-2015-pdns-30-photographers-on-tumblr-instagram.html">her own Instagram feed</a> and on Everyday Everywhere says, “Because the nature of distribution is changing all the time, it’s making people scared but it’s also liberating, I think. Think about other ways of sharing your work. Because the old gatekeepers are not there, it’s a more democratic market now. If you’re able to do a really great project, you have certain outlets you can access.”<br />
<br />
"Over time I’ve realized, through critique, that those images I used to take 'for myself' can speak the loudest, moments that are a very personal interpretation of what is happening, and I’ve been working to hone in on that,” says Mustard, who started out shooting news stories while living in Cairo, and has moved into shooting features and long-term projects. “This is something I’m still very much figuring out, but when the work I do is more personal and something I greatly care about, it’s very clear that those pieces translate best to an audience.”<br />

    <article_text><![CDATA[Every <a href="http://www.pdns30.com/gallery/2015/#grid"><em>PDN’s</em> 30 photographer</a> has had to find their own path into the professional photography business, but along the way, they were lucky to find experienced colleagues who gave them words of encouragement, useful insights and, when needed, honest critiques that kept them pushing forward. A common theme in the <em>PDN’s </em>30 profiles is how much the photographers benefitted from advisors who were both caring and candid. 
<p>We asked <em>PDN’s 30</em> photographers to tell us about the feedback and advice that helped them the most when they were starting out. </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pdns30.com/gallery/2015/#3-Peter_Bohler">Peter Bohler</a> </strong></p>
<p>Greg Miller “said that photography has an emotional side and a technical side. People have strengths in one area or the other, but it really needs to be a balance. You need to work toward cultivating both.”</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pdns30.com/gallery/2015/#4-Clarissa_Bonet">Clarissa Bonet</a></strong></p>
<p>“I was really nervous that life was going to take over and my work was going to fall by the wayside. I’ve seen it happen to so many photographers…. They get out of school and don’t do anything, because everyone needs to make money right out of school.... One thing [Columbia College faculty member] Ross Sawyers said was that you need to make your artistic practice your second job… and dedicate at least 20 hours a week to your practice. Grant writing, website updates, promotional stuff, research, writing—all of that stuff falls under the umbrella of your artistic practice.”</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pdns30.com/gallery/2015/#8-Paul_Colangelo">Paul Colangelo</a> </strong></p>
<p>“Frans Lanting advised me to work on one story I’m passionate about, and continue working it for years, from every angle, until I’m an expert on the subject, until I have something to say about it. And when I think I’ve finished, start working on it again.”</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pdns30.com/gallery/2015/#2-Anna_Beeke">Anna Beeke</a> </strong></p>
<p>Elinor Carucci “was very critical and intelligent and always had handy references of work to look at, but she was also very motherly and we just had a great [relationship]. She would tell you if you sucked, or an image sucked.” </p>

<p>“[A]t <em>&Uacute;ltimas Noticias</em>, a local newspaper, I learned a lot from Iv&aacute;n Gonzalez and Joaquin Ferrer. They taught me to see beyond the news and to always try to find a new perspective.”</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pdns30.com/gallery/2015/#7-Michael_Clinard">Michael Clinard</a></strong></p>
<p>“I recall Alex Hayden delivering sermon-like lectures on the benefits of marketing oneself early.” </p>

<p>“In the Bay Area, a local critique group known as Library Candy fosters engaging dialogue concerning each member’s projects and trends in the medium. I’ve grown tremendously through discussing work with these more experienced photographers: Lucas Foglia, Jason Fulford, Eric Carroll, Nigel Poor, Chris McCaw, Meghann Riepenhoff, and Richard Misrach…. Of them all, Richard Misrach has set a beautiful standard of generosity and engagement, including my work in lectures, introducing me to potential book publishers, and overall demonstrating a genuine interest in my work and success as an artist.”</p>

<p>About her partner, photographer <a href="http://www.edoardoagresti.it/">Edoardo Agresti</a>, photographer Giancarlo Ceraudo and photo editor Diego Orlando, she says: “They pushed me, and encouraged me, calling me: ‘What are you doing? Go take your camera and go take pictures.’ </p>

<p>“<a href="http://www.daviddegner.com/">David Degner</a>, a photographer based in Cairo before me, was a great mentor to me while I was trying to get my footing both in Egypt and the industry….

    <article_text><![CDATA[On Monday, March 23, in McDowell County, West Virginia, photographer <a href="http://www.marishaphoto.com/">Marisha Camp</a> and her brother Jesse found themselves confronted by an angry and hostile group of folks, who accused them of taking photographs of children without permission. The Camps, who were on the road gathering material for a television show they hope to pitch later this year, were detained and threatened with physical violence by these local citizens. After a 45-minute confrontation, the Camps were escorted out of the county by the West Virginia state police.
<p>The story was picked up by local news stations and by national photography magazines and blogs. As is usual when Appalachia is the subject, the story was told primarily by and about one group—outsiders visiting the area. That’s not to say the Camps’s accounts of what happened aren’t valid, but they’ve been given a platform not afforded many of the others involved. The locals have been portrayed as vigilantes, as mob- or gang-like. One national photography magazine titled their story, “West Virginia Mob Reportedly Detains Photographers for Looking Out-of-Town.” Let’s be clear: the Camps weren’t detained for looking “out-of-town.” They were detained, illegally this West Virginian and photographer believes, because parents thought they'd photographed their children without their permission.</p>
<p>Knowing that I am from West Virginia and that I have a professional and personal interest in work being made in and about Appalachia, a friend posted the news story on my Facebook wall. Several other people contacted me to ask what I thought about the situation. After watching the local news story, I knew there was much more to the story. I knew there would be fallout, and feared that locals would bear the brunt of it.</p>
<p>Searching for a greater understanding of the incident and the actions that caused it, I began reaching out to those directly involved. I contacted Marisha Camp on Thursday, March 26, and over the next few days I exchanged calls and dozens of text messages with her and her brother. On April 2, I spoke with Jennifer Adkins, the woman who accused the Camps of photographing her children and threatened them with a gun.</p>
<p>I also contacted journalists and filmmakers who have worked in Appalachia, and a local photographer, to gain as much perspective as possible about what happened that day. I asked them to comment on the situation in McDowell County because none of the reporting thus far attempts to look at the long history of misrepresentation in Appalachia. Sure, this could’ve happened anywhere. But it didn’t. It happened in McDowell County, West Virginia. And although the Camps may not have been intentionally seeking out “poverty porn,” many local residents view photographers, both insiders and outsiders, with understandable suspicion.</p>
<p><strong>“You don’t look like upstanding citizens.”</strong></p>
<p>The Camps had been on the road for months, working their way across the country filming and making photographs. On Sunday, March 22, they filmed a church service in McDowell County. The following day, they decided to collect B-roll footage. “We noticed these three obese kids playing with sticks in [a] driveway,” Jesse Camp recalls. “When we drove by I asked them if they were having a stick fight. They sort of laughed and that was that. We drove on.” On their way from Jolo to Raysal, the Camps parked their Volvo station wagon with Massachusetts license plates at a gas station and crossed the road to photograph some houses and talk with some folks. Soon thereafter, Marisha Camp heard someone yelling across the road and noticed a van blocking in their vehicle. The van’s owner, Jennifer Adkins, was upset because she thought the Camps were photographing her children without her consent, and she demanded the pair hand their cameras over. The situation escalated quickly.</p>
<p>According to Marisha Camp, Adkins immediately threatened them. She opened the door of her van and pointed to what she said was a gun, stating that the Camps weren’t leaving until they handed over their cameras and the police arrived. Afraid and panicking, Camp tried to call for help, but had no cell service. Camp was able to record <a href="https://soundcloud.com/roger-may-1">audio of the incident</a> on her phone. “Have you all looked at yourselves in the mirror? You don’t look like upstanding citizens,” Adkins can be heard saying on the recording. For nearly 45 minutes, the situation intensified. An angry crowd grew around the Camps, despite Marisha Camp showing Adkins’s husband the images on one of their cameras in an attempt to prove that none of the images were of their children.</p>
<p>Local parents were already on edge due to the disappearance of a young child in the area: The same day the Camps were filming the church service in Jolo, less than a hundred miles away in Pulaski County, Virginia, five year-old Noah Thomas went missing. The sheriff’s department received more than a hundred tips, many of which identified suspicious vehicles in the area. (Sadly, Thomas’s body was found on his parents’ property in a septic tank Thursday, March 26, five days after he was reported missing. His parents have been charged with felony abuse and neglect.)</p>
<p>Finally, West Virginia state police arrived on the scene. After assessing the situation, they escorted the Camps out of the area and lectured them about how they “ought to be careful about not making ugly pictures about the people of West Virginia,” Marisha Camp says. Later that day, she contacted the McDowell County sheriff’s department and was told by a deputy, “You’re lucky you weren’t shot.”</p>
<p><strong>“We love West Virginia.”</strong></p>
<p>“I’m a gypsy, self-admittedly,” Jesse Camp told me on the phone on March 31. “I love traveling every nook and cranny of America. My sister and I have been road tripping forever, man. We’ve been everywhere, all over the South, and 99 percent of the people we meet are cool.”</p>
<p>Jesse Camp says he and his sister had been all over West Virginia. “Logan, Omar, Iaeger, War, Jolo and Bradshaw. You know man, West Virginia is like the most outlaw place. We love West Virginia.”</p>
<p>Marisha Camp echoes her brother, and she’s been actively responding via Facebook to inaccurate claims from McDowell County residents about the incident. “We really love West Virginia, and it was utterly heartbreaking to think about not going back,” she says. “I know not everyone [there] is like that.”</p>
<p>Also upset by the behavior of the police, Marisha Camp wrote a letter to West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, detailing the events. In the letter she writes that she “strongly believes” in combatting “negative stereotypes of the region,” but calls the actions of the police “absurd and about as counterproductive as it gets.”</p>
<p>“It is for everyone's benefit that incidents like this are taken seriously,” she writes. “I would have been encouraged to press charges anywhere else rather than be run of town like a ‘long haired hippie’ and then told by law enforcement that I'm somehow lucky because I wasn't murdered.”</p>
<p>Despite all this, the Camps say they’ve received overwhelming support from residents of McDowell County. Many have contacted the Camps via Facebook apologizing for the actions of a few people and offering them places to stay if they make it back.</p>
<p><strong>“We had no choice but to question their motives.”</strong></p>
<p>Jennifer Adkins was on the phone with a neighbor when her 13-year-old son walked in the front door and told her, “there was a guy out there taking pictures.”</p>
<p>Adkins hung up the phone and immediately called 911 to report the incident. She, her husband and their two sons got in their minivan and drove after the Camps in order to get a license plate number. (As a parent, I understand the fear and concern Adkins must have felt for her children in the moment, especially considering the missing child in the news.) Once they found the Camps's vehicle at a gas station in English, they called 911 again to report the tag information.</p>
<p>“I was floored by their appearance. They looked like bums. I don’t mean that to sound derogatory, but they did,” Adkins told me. “I saw [Marisha Camp] put one of her cameras away and then she started showing my husband pictures from the other one.”</p>
<p>Both Jesse and Marisha Camp deny making photographs of the Adkins’s children. But the family didn’t know what the Camps were up to because they never came to their door to ask if it was OK to talk to their children or photograph them. Therein lies the problem for me, and for Adkins. “I can understand them [the Camps] being scared, but we had no choice but to question their motives,” Adkins says. “I wouldn’t have ever given them permission to take pictures of my kids, let alone talk to them, but they never gave me the chance.”</p>
<p>Adkins admits she threatened the Camps. “I mean, I said I had a gun, but I didn’t. I wanted them to know I meant business and that they weren’t leaving until the police showed up. I told [Marisha Camp] that she could leave by ambulance or by a police car, but she wasn’t going nowhere until I saw that she didn’t have pictures of my boys,” Adkins recalls. Soon thereafter, Adkins says, residents she didn’t even know began to gather around. She says the other residents, who must’ve felt they were looking out for their own, "sort of took over."</p>
<p>I asked Adkins about judging the Camps by how they looked when for so long West Virginia has been the butt of so many jokes about appearance. I had a really hard time with this one. “I know,” Adkins says, “but if I go to New York City, I’m going to stand out and possibly be stereotyped. Anybody who knows me knows that I’m outspoken. We [West Virginians] always get portrayed bad. And we didn’t know what they were up to.”</p>
<p>A few days after the confrontation, Adkins was <a href="http://www.wvva.com/story/28617658/2015/03/25/controversy-over-out-of-state-photographers-in-mcdowell-co">interviewed by WVVA</a>, the local news station, after they saw her Facebook posts about the incident. Adkins has taken down most of the posts, but I had taken screenshots for my notes. In one post, she wrote, “They are from Mass. and said they were doing a ‘documentary’…. All I can say is they best NOT COME BACK TO RAYSAL!!!!!” Someone commenting on Adkins’s Facebook page posted the Camps’s license plate number, and several commenters also included pictures of the Camps’s vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>“We don’t get to choose who makes work in Appalachia.”</strong></p>
<p>Elaine McMillion Sheldon, a native West Virginian, spent more than three years on and off working on <em><a href="http://hollowdocumentary.com">Hollow</a></em>, an interactive, community-driven documentary project about McDowell County’s past, present and future from the perspectives of local residents. When I reached out to her, she was beside herself about the incident and didn't understand why residents would react as they did. “What is the goal here? I think it's a question of how we want to be seen,” she says. “Do we want to be seen as a threat?”</p>
<p>Sheldon says residents she talked to in the County are divided about the incident. She was surprised that local photographers told her they don’t agree with the kind of work the Camps were making. Sheldon says: "We don’t get to choose who makes work in Appalachia. We can’t police who makes pictures here, but we should try to educate those who want to come in to document, and encourage a more nuanced story. We all need to stand together as artists, regardless of whether we like a specific artist’s work or not. You can't pick and choose whose rights you support based upon whether you like or dislike their work. All artists have the same legal rights, regardless of the art they create."</p>
<p><strong>“The visual equivalent of hate speech.”</strong></p>
<p>Kate Fowler has worked in West Virginia extensively and was recently hired by the Magnum Foundation in New York. Her film, <em><a href="http://www.kateelizabethfowler.com/">Nitro</a></em>, chronicles the complicated relationship between a small West Virginia town and the chemical plants that both provide jobs and impact the environment in West Virginia’s “Chemical Valley.” Fowler also spent a great deal of time in McDowell County working on her film <em>With Signs Following</em>, about the late Mack Wolford, a preacher and serpent-handler from southern West Virginia.</p>
<p>Fowler views the actions of the Camps and the reactions of the local citizens as part of a long, complicated history of photography in Appalachia.</p>
<p>Many in West Virginia, Fowler says, recognize that outsiders who’ve photographed their communities without consent have participated in the “dissemination of classist and bigoted rhetoric—the visual equivalent of hate speech.” Fowler also points out that when a small group of citizens decided to speak up for themselves, “the Internet...mobilized to discredit and to once again, deny the subject’s capacity for critical engagement.”</p>
<p>“No person deserves to be threatened with violence” or held against their will, Fowler adds. But, she says, “We [as photographers] must not presume that our intentions are clear, nor deny the trauma we may invoke through our actions, tools or intentions.”</p>
<p><strong>“Am I supposed to go and knock on each and every door?”</strong></p>
<p>Alan Johnston is a native and lifelong resident of McDowell County, West Virginia. He’s a musician and landscape photographer I met several years ago through Sheldon’s <em>Hollow</em> project. I reached out to him to get a local photographer’s perspective on what happened and he was kind enough to talk with me.</p>
<p>Johnston says he was “genuinely concerned” when he heard about the incident, especially when he considers what it might mean for his ability to work locally. “I really don’t understand what I’m supposed to do,” he says. “Do I tell somebody at the mouth of the holler that I’m taking pictures of barns and landscapes? How will the people in the head of the holler know what I’m doing? Am I supposed to go and knock on each and every door and report to people who I am and what I’m doing?” He notes that he rarely photographs people he doesn’t know, but rather photographs landscapes of McDowell County for his own pleasure.</p>
<p>Johnston recalled a time a few years back when he was out making pictures in the county and pulled off on the side of the road to photograph a horse in a barn. “All of a sudden this woman came out on her porch and started yelling at me. ‘You better not take any bad pictures on this mountain,’ she yelled.”</p>
<p>He staunchly defends his right to make pictures on public property, but confided that there are a whole lot of people “skeptical of anyone doing anything around here.” So it’s clearly not just outsiders that are met with suspicion.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural insensitivity and privilege</strong></p>
<p>Jesse Camp says this could’ve happened anywhere. It’s true. It could’ve. But it didn’t. It happened in West Virginia. And if you’re not familiar with the long history of visual misrepresentation of the region, then close your eyes and think about the first thing that pops in your head when you hear the words “West Virginia.” See what I mean?</p>
<p>Understanding the very real history of misrepresentation in Appalachia—particularly McDowell County, West Virginia, which is often portrayed as a hopeless pocket of rural Appalachia (a depiction I take great issue with)—by no means implies that it’s justifiable to hold people against their will and threaten physical violence. It’s also unreasonable to judge anyone by his or her appearance or how they talk, no matter who they are or where they’re from. But it’s important, although not easy for everyone, to understand where the anger comes from. It’s only through self-awareness that both photographers and local residents can hope to prevent incidents like this.</p>
<p>West Virginia is in my DNA. It’s a huge part of who I am. I’m also a photographer, which is an equally huge part of who I am. Often when these two meet it can be a challenge to find a balance, to reconcile history with the present, to challenge what we’ve been shown with what we know. I’m all too aware of how we’re portrayed, joked about and stereotyped. I’m also aware of how important listening is, and how making work in Appalachia isn’t as much about me as it is about honoring, respecting and searching for home. I’m not saying the way I work is the right way, if there is such a thing, but I am saying I don’t want to be another taker in a long line of takers.</p>
<p>Without a true understanding of the long history of takers in Appalachia, it can be hard to understand why locals reacted the way they did. The Camps deny both their privilege and a lack of understanding. They stated to me several times that they’ve been living out of their car, wearing the same clothes over and over again, and doing so with little to no money. But there’s nothing that pisses underprivileged people off more than privileged folks blind to their own privilege. Does that make the Camps bad people? I don’t think so. Does being threatened, blocked in, called names, yelled at and held hostage until state police arrived seem warranted? Again, I don’t think so. The Camps are likable people and I’ve found nothing in the time I’ve spent communicating with them that would lead me to feel otherwise, but I can raise concern over their cultural insensitivity.</p>
<p>Does that mean they can’t make work in Appalachia? Absolutely not.</p>
<p>Privilege can be tricky. I know this all too well. But photographers should be aware of it and sensitive to it. Marisha Camp was quick to counter my mention of this via text. “I’ll bet that lady [Jennifer Adkins] makes more money than me.”</p>
<p>This isn’t a situation in which it’s easy to either support the photographers or support the community. It’s much more complex than that. What would’ve happened if the Camps had knocked on the door of the Adkins house? What would’ve happened if Jennifer Adkins had simply left after seeing no pictures of her children had been taken? If the Camps were more apologetic and disarming in their responses, would the situation have escalated?</p>
<p>This isn’t just a place in a road trip documentary. This place is my home. It’s true that we can’t police who does and doesn’t make work in Appalachia. But when I reflect on this situation, I’m reminded of a saying by my granddad, “Enough is enough and too much is nasty.”</p>
<p>Thanks to Marisha Camp, Jesse Camp, Jennifer Adkins, Elaine McMillion Sheldon, Kate Fowler, Joy Salyers and Alan Johnston for their time in contributing to this article.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[For photographers with an
archive brimming with slides, contact sheets, negatives and prints, the future
of that work looks bright. Basic defenses against the corrosive agents of time,
a dollop of good fortune and those photos have an excellent chance of surviving
for potentially a hundred years or more.<br />
<br />
Digital photographs? Not so
much.
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“We’re living in an
unprecedented time,” says Henry Wilhelm, co-founder of Wilhelm Imaging Research
and a photo permanence expert. For all of human history, we’ve created
“human-readable” records—like your archive of prints—that require nothing more
than a working set of eyes to be accessed and understood. Now we are in an age
of “machine readable” records. In such an age, it’s a question of whether
future software and devices will be able to able to access, read and display
the bits of digital information that represent your images. As anyone who’s
held an 8-inch floppy disk knows, that’s no sure thing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To shepherd your digital
photos through generations, three major factors have to be considered.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>The Security of Your Files</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The ideal solution, says
stock photographer and image preservation expert <a href="http://www.riecks.com/">David Riecks</a>, is known as the “3-2-1 approach.” That’s three
copies of a file, stored in two different places with one of those locations off-site.
Wilhelm prefers hard drives as cloud since services like Dropbox are only good
archival solutions as long as they’re in business. As the history of
technological disruption attests, today’s well-capitalized empires may collapse
into tomorrow’s business school case studies. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The life of any given hard
drive is variable, but a <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/how-long-do-disk-drives-last/">study</a> from
the cloud provider BackBlaze based on a comprehensive examination of drives
used in their servers, found the average to be <span>six to seven years. Migrating
data to new drives on a five-year basis may provide extra insurance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Moving large amounts of data back-and-forth introduces plenty of opportunities for file corruption. Fortunately you can run the equivalent of a “DNA test” on files that are being transferred from one media to another to ensure they arrive intact. Riecks uses a hashing program that creates a checksum file that examines the bit structure of all his archived files. If there were any errors introduced during the transfer process, the checksum file will flag them. AV Preserve <a href="http://www.avpreserve.com/avpsresources/tools/">offers a variety of file-checking tool</a>s, some of them free, to verify the integrity of image collections across storage platforms.</p>
<div>The recently introduced <a href="http://www.mylio.com">Mylio</a> software is another very effective method to keep
files synchronized multiple platforms, including offline devices, Wilhelm said.
While Mylio is new, it is “cloud agnostic” and preserves the file structure in
a Mac or Windows environment so that in the event it is shut down, a user would
still be able to easily locate images on stored devices, says company founder
David Vaskevitch. Unlike other image organizers, “Mylio has protection baked
in,” since it also adheres to the 3-2-1 approach and offers a visual guide
alongside each image to alert users to its protection status, Vaskevitch says.</div>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One shouldn’t overlook the
value of printing as an archival method either, Wilhelm says. Properly produced
and cared for, printed images can last for hundreds of years—far longer than
any contemporary digital storage media. What’s more, a signed and dated print
is the currency of the fine art photographic market, Wilhelm says. “You don’t
see people spending $5.6 million for a file.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>The Readability of Your Files</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Second, and more
challenging, is choosing an image file format that has the best chance of being
machine-readable in the future. “A primary characteristic for an archival
format is that the structure and nature of the format be openly documented
and understandable by any reasonable software engineer in the imaging field,”
says Tom Hogarty, Director of Product Management at Adobe.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">JPEGs and the Adobe-championed
DNG format fall under this umbrella. "Support for JPEG codecs will remain part of photographic software years from now," says Peter Schelkens, PR chair for the JPEG Committee. "I do not see main photo software vendors discontinuing support in the near and not so near future. Moreover, the fact that JPEG is an official ISO/IEC and ITU-T standard guarantees that it is well documented and generally accepted. Such standard specifications are well archived and should in principle allow you to decode these images even thousands of years from now, assuming of course we did not move out of the digital era." </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A “plain vanilla TIFF” file, while proprietary,
is also very well documented and is Riecks’ archival format of choice. For
Riecks, “plain vanilla” means an 8-bit TIFF file in the AdobeRGB color space.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Library of Congress uses bitmaps in a TIFF wrapper to preserve their digital photo files, says Carl
Fleischhauer, project panager in the Office of Strategic Initiatives at the
Library of Congress. This approach prioritizes long-term readability over the
ability to make future edits to a file, but photographers may want the emphasis
on the latter. In that case, formats like DNG make sense, Fleischhauer says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What our experts were less
confident in was the ability of proprietary, camera-specific RAW files to offer as high a
degree of longevity and readability.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Preserving the Metadata</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ensuring a photo has
accurate and thorough metadata is critical to digital photo preservation,
argues Riecks, because it enables future programs to find and organize a
photographic collection. It also ensures critical copyright data travels with
the images as they migrate from old storage solutions (like hard drives) to new
ones that haven’t even been conceived of yet. It also protects images that are
discovered online from being deemed “orphaned” works. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A first step to preserving
metadata is to make sure it’s input early in your workflow, otherwise you’re
“throwing images into a black hole,” Riecks says. Given the sheer number of
images you’re likely managing, it makes sense to discriminate. Riecks will
batch process all photos with a minimum amount of metadata to ensure basics like
location, copyright, time and date, and captioning details are represented. For
images he cares more about, he’ll input even more information such as tags,
ratings and keywords. Riecks offers a <a href="http://www.controlledvocabulary.com/metalogging/ck_guidelines.html">series of detailed keywording guidelines</a> on his site, <a href="http://www.controlledvocabulary.com/">Controlled
Vocabulary</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Like image files<a href="http://www.photometadata.org/META-101-metadata-types">, metadata files come in a variety of flavors</a> and not all will be viable as a long-term preserve
of valuable image information. Adobe, for instance, backs the open-source <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/xmp.html">XMP</a> (for Extensible Metadata Platform) format. News and
photo agencies use the <a href="http://iptc.org/standards/photo-metadata/iptc-standard/">IPTC Photo Metadata Standard</a>, which is built off of Adobe’s XMP and an older IPTC
standard to ensure long-term interoperability (it also comes with its own <a href="http://www.embeddedmetadata.org/embedded-metatdata-manifesto.php">manifesto</a>).
Another virtue of using widely available image file formats as opposed to proprietary
RAW files is that they support embedding metadata into the image file.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Whatever method you adopt,
it’s clear that for images to survive for decades in a machine-readable age,
image-makers have to keep preservation at the forefront of their workflow.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“There’s a paradigm shift in
that preservation used to be the end of the process,” Fleischhauer says. “Now,
preservation actions have to start at the very beginning of your workflow.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<strong>Client: </strong>Nasty Gal
<p><strong>Director of Photography:</strong> Anouck Bertin</p>
<p><strong>Client: </strong>Refinery29</p>
<p><strong>Photo Editor: </strong>Julia Finch</p>
<p>On most of her assignments for editorial and commercial clients, still-life photographer <a href="http://www.stephaniegonot.com/">Stephanie Gonot</a> does her own propping, styling and art direction. “I think that clients like that I can do the whole thing myself,” the Los Angeles-based photographer says. “I enjoy shooting solo on the smaller jobs, because I can get into a zone and move quickly.”</p>
<p>Her long-time clients often give her a subject, then let her figure out how she wants to shoot it. That’s true for <a href="http://www.nastygal.com/">Nasty Gal</a>, the online fashion retailer Gonot has been shooting for since 2013, when Sarah Kissel, the senior art director at the time, hired her to shoot a photo illustration for the <em><a href="http://supernasty.nastygal.com/">Nasty Gal</a> </em><a href="http://supernasty.nastygal.com/">magazine</a>. Typically, Nasty Gal sends her some fashion accessories to shoot, sometimes with suggestions for a color scheme or materials to use. A few days later, Gonot delivers the images she has created, which Nasty Gal typically uses in its email promotions.  </p>
<p>When the assignment called for her to shoot a white shoe, Anouck Bertin, Nasty Gal’s director of photography, said she had in mind one of Gonot’s earliest still lifes, which showed a meal from McDonald’s that Gonot had spray painted white and shot on white seamless. Gonot, who had studied painting, made the image in 2010, shortly after she began experimenting with photography. It inspired her to begin her best-known series—on the ingredients of fad diets—shot on colored backdrops. Her playful imagery is a good fit for the Nasty Gal brand, which Gonot describes as “colorful, and a little bit irreverent. Or maybe a lot irreverent.” </p>
<p>Her assignments for <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/">Refinery29</a> are even more open-ended. The first time the fashion and lifestyle website hired Gonot in 2014, she sent the editors some PDFs to show her ideas and get them approved. After that, she’s been given free rein to come up with her own treatments. “They would come to me with a story and say we need six pictures that illustrate this story, here are the six points we’ll cover, do you have any ideas?”</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/083_Gonot_Refinery29_TheTruthAboutTripping2014-ARTICLE.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" /></p>
<p>For a story called <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/lsd-shrooms-psychedelic-drugs">“The Truth about Tripping: How Psychedelics Made a Comeback,”</a> Refinery29 photo editor Julia Finch asked her to come up with four trippy images, and suggested it would be fun to show them as animated GIFs. Though the compositions were very different from the shot of the white shoe she created for Nasty Gal, on both assignments Gonot used the same lighting and camera setup, making only slight modifications. </p>
<p><strong>Logistics</strong></p>
<p>Gonot shoots most tabletop setups on 4-foot-wide seamless, and has a variety of colors and materials to choose from. She does most of her own prop shopping, “which keeps costs down,” she says. </p>
<p>For the <em>Nasty Gal</em> white-on-white shoot, she pulled some seamless from her collection, and bought some fruit for propping and some spray paint. For the Refinery29 story, she bought some colorful children’s blocks, which she set on a sheet of black Plexiglas, which absorbs and disguises shadows. After some experimentation, she decided to use some white pegboard she had in her studio as her backdrop. The pattern of holes in the pegboard, which she leaned against the wall behind her table, was reflected in the black Plexi. </p>
<p>To photograph the reflected pattern, she says, “I was on my tiptoes, looking down on the Plexi to capture that weird effect of the dots trailing away.”</p>
<p>Gonot puts time and attention into her compositions, so she finds it satisfying to work on images that will appear online: “It’s nice that the images aren’t cropped,” she explains.</p>
<p><strong>Lighting</strong></p>
<p>Though she rents bigger lights on some productions, when she’s shooting on her own, Gonot likes to use a simple setup so that she can move quickly and easily as she shoots. This setup usually combines two Calumet Travelites with a Canon Speedlite 430EX II on her camera, which she’ll turn up or down to adjust the flash. She’ll also use the speedlight to trigger her strobes. “That’s the general setup when I’m in my studio, then I modify from there, depending on what I’m shooting.”</p>
<p>For the white shot for Nasty Gal, she used one Travelite on a stand about seven feet high, to the right of the table. Shooting white objects on white seamless, she wanted to soften the light, so she fired it through a white umbrella. The Speedlite provided some fill. “It gives it a little bit of extra kick of light,” she says. “It takes away dark shadows.” </p>
<p>For the shot of colored blocks, the strobes were bare, and positioned so they hit both the blocks and the white pegboard background at the same time. For this shot, she powered the Speedlite down. “It’s used almost as a trigger, more than a fill, but it adds a little bit of something.”</p>
<p><strong>Camera</strong></p>
<p>Gonot used a Canon EOS 5D Mark III with 24–70mm f/2.8 zoom. She notes, “These are small objects. I’ve got to zoom in to get the details.” Shooting with the Speedlite turned up, she’ll typically shoot at ISO 160, and rarely uses a tripod. “I like to move around and try different angles and move things around.” </p>
<p><strong>Postproduction</strong></p>
<p>Gonot began making still-lifes before she learned Photoshop, “so I had to make sure I got everything in-camera because I didn’t know how to clean things up.” These days she’s more experienced, but she typically has to turn a job around in only four or five days, which leaves little time for retouching. “I try to shoot these so that not much post is needed.” </p>
<p>Gonot typically shoots a lot of variations, modifying her lights or position as she goes, and may produce up to 200 images on a shoot. “It’s like I’m doing a lot of sketches,” she explains. She reviews the take, noting everything she likes.  She’ll typically send about 20–60 low-res images to Nasty Gal; when they choose the finals, she’ll clean up the selection then send high-res files; Nasty Gal has their own retoucher for more extensive retouching. For Refinery29, she typically edits the story herself, and forwards her final selection to Finch. “That’s just how Julia and I work,” Gonot says. “I’m choosing this image from this set because it looks good with the image from that set.”  </p>
<p>The Refinery29 tripping story was Gonot’s first experience making animated GIFs. Once she figured out the process in Photoshop, she delivered four subtly reverberating GIF files, which were published on the site in August 2014.</p>]]></article_text>

You can stave off dehydration with a seam-sealed side pouch that can store 70 ounces of liquid in an optional hydration reservoir. The internals offer the usual padded, adjustable dividers. A laptop sleeve sits in the front pocket and you can clip a tripod to the bottom of the bag. You’ll find a rain cover at the bottom of the bag, for when the skies open up. </div>

The interior can be sub-divided by using seven adjustable Velcro dividers. The sides and bottom of the bag are padded to protect your gear, and the bag will stay upright when you place it down. You can fit a DSLR body, 10-inch lens and a 13-inch laptop or 10-inch tablet, and an armful of odds and ends inside the Jude—the dividers come out to make for more space. Both the front and the back offer a zipper pocket and a snap pocket for quickly accessing smaller items. The Jude is stitched from gray canvas and trimmed with leather.</div>

Manfrotto Off Road Back Pack 30L</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div>Manfrotto’s first foray into outdoor photo backpacks is the appropriately named <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1111494-REG/manfrotto_mb_or_bp_30gy_off_road_hiking_backpack_gray.html/BI/1282/KBID/1657/kw/MAMBORBP30GY/DFF/d10-v2-t1-xMAMBORBP30GY">Off Road</a>. Half of the bag’s carrying capacity is devoted to photo gear; the other half dedicated to personal items. And in those rare moments that you don’t want to carry your camera, you can convert the bag to carry just your personal items. Manfrotto says the Off Road can stash a pro DSLR with a 70–200mm f/2.8 lens, plus additional lenses and accessories, in its interior. There’s a removable insert with handles that you can pop out of the bag. You can also clip a tripod and a pair of walking sticks to the back of the bag. Manfrotto will offer a color-coordinated pair of walking sticks—made by the Italian firm Fizan—that have a removable cap at the top to double as a monopod with a max payload of 5.5 pounds. The sticks are sold separately for $100. </div>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Christopher Grimes has worked in the advertising business for 15 years, both as an art producer and as a photo agent. While at The Martin Agency and Crispin Porter + Bogusky, he worked with numerous photographers and produced photo shoots around the globe. In 2013, he joined <a href="https://olson.com/">Olson</a>, an advertising agency in Minneapolis, as a senior integrated art producer creating custom content for clients such as Target, General Mills and the Baylor College of Medicine. In an email interview with<em> PDN</em> and an Olson publicist, Grimes discussed his work with photographers in creating integrated campaigns for a variety of platforms.
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What can you tell us about Olson?</strong></p>
<p><strong>CG: </strong>Everyone here is like family; to me, that is everything. As far as a company and our offerings, we have three divisions—brand &amp; digital (Olson), loyalty (Olson 1to1) and PR (Olson Engage). For clients, we’re a one-stop agency.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Olson’s slogan is “revolutionizing engagement.” How so?</strong></p>
<p><strong>CG: </strong>Olson is a unique agency in that, in addition to its advertising and digital capabilities, we have really strong, industry-leading practices in areas like loyalty and PR that allow us to offer our clients a broader range of ways to engage their customers. </p>
<p>We also believe that marketers are only starting to grasp what’s now possible thanks to evolving technology and emerging media. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What does the “integrated” part of your title mean?</strong></p>
<p><strong>CG:</strong> It means we don’t exclusively work on photography or illustration projects. Since I’ve been at Olson, I have produced a range of artwork for social media, websites, events, video productions, installations and of course, traditional photography and illustration for print.  </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What role do you think photography can play in integrated solutions for a brand? </strong></p>
<p><strong>CG: </strong>Visual storytelling gets more important all the time, wouldn’t you agree?</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What are some projects you’ve worked on that you are proud of? </strong></p>
<p><strong>CG:</strong> One of my favorite projects so far has been a photo shoot for the <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/">Baylor College of Medicine</a>. The creative team created a beautiful campaign that used black-and-white photography from <a href="http://www.nadavkander.com/">Nadav Kander</a> to focus on the hands of the doctors at BCM. The BCM project used gallery-quality photography to convey the elite status of the Baylor College of Medicine doctors. </p>
<p>Another favorite was <a href="http://stealanylook.com/">the Steal the Look app</a> for the beauty brand wet n wild. That included both still and video assets. It’s a bright, brassy, well-designed app and it’s fun to use…even if you don’t wear makeup! For wet n wild we needed to convey edgy and bold style that screams L.A. [Photographer] <a href="http://www.meredithjenks.com/">Meredith Jenks</a> was the perfect choice.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Why were the photographers you chose right for the assignments? </strong></p>
<p><strong>CG: </strong>For BCM, we vetted so many brilliant photographers. They all brought a unique approach to the project, however in the end Nadav Kander brought a sophistication that we loved. </p>
<p>Meredith Jenks’s [photography] is stylish, colorful, fun and irreverent—exactly what the wet n wild brand is. Also, her energy made her stand out both in the creative calls and on set.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Do you have favorite ways of finding photographers, or being approached by photographers? </strong></p>
<p><strong>CG: </strong>Through building relationships with their agents over the course of many years. Personal visits to the agency from the photographers is also a nice way to have an idea of their personalities and how they will work with the creative teams prior to putting them up for an assignment. </p>
<p>Meeting the photographers...is not essential to me suggesting them or assigning them a project. Their work is first and foremost. However, a personality that you click with is definitely a good thing.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Are you looking for new talent, or do you tend to rely on a stable of freelancers you trust? </strong></p>
<p><strong>CG:</strong> Both! I love my trusted partners (most have become friends) and always throw them into the mix if possible. At Olson I love meeting with new photographers and have worked with quite a few that have come to visit us.</p>
<p>I guess 80 percent of the photographers I have worked with since I have been at Olson have been new to me. Perhaps I knew of them but it was my first time partnering with them. Both Nadav and Meredith were new.</p>
<p>Many of the local Minneapolis photographers I have worked with have been new as well.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What skills or talents does a photographer need to have to convince you to entrust him or her with an assignment? </strong></p>
<p><strong>CG: </strong>They need to do their homework prior to the creative calls—spend time getting to know both the client and agency brands. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Have agency or client expectations about your role changed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>CG:</strong>  Yes, I think mostly with timelines and budget. Clients want more…with fewer resources. They need to react to trends quicker.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: You worked at a photo agency for a while. What did you learn from that experience? </strong></p>
<p><strong>CG:</strong> Being an agent is a tough job! Agents and producers are in this together—the more information you can give agents, the better they can help you to get what you and your client need.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Is there anything you wish photographers understood better about advertising today? How should they not approach you? </strong></p>
<p><strong>CG:</strong> Two things: First, when you contact us, please do your homework. There are too many times I get emails or calls saying ‘I’m perfect for such and such a client’ and their style isn’t even close to the current creative or we’re not working on that client anymore. Second, it’s nice to have occasional follow-up, but please know we can’t personally answer everything. Art producers are inundated with emails, mail and calls, and answering them all on top of our workload is nearly impossible. Show us your latest work, add a few lines personally tailored to the recipient and don’t make the email open-ended.</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[It’s an inescapable fact: At some point, all of us will die. And we all hope that when we do, we leave our loved ones with minimal mess and maximum gain from our assets. But for various reasons—lack of time, confusion about the options, or denial of our mortality—we may not be planning accordingly. 
<p>For photographers, bequeathing archives can be especially complicated. During the course of his or her career, the typical photographer will make hundreds of thousands of images. What value does the work have, and who should inherit it? How should it be organized so that it will continue to be relevant, and how can its tax liability be minimized?</p>
<p>What happens to a photographer’s estate after death, and the amount of tax levied on it, can vary according to the estate plan the photographer puts in place. And while death (we hope) seems a distant prospect, it can pay to start planning early.</p>
<p>In order to distill some of the best practices, we spoke to several photographers who are putting estate plans in place now, and to professionals in the field. They outlined simple but effective ways of dealing with large bodies of work, and deciding what should happen to them posthumously. </p>
<p><strong>Organization</strong></p>
<p>According to almost everyone we interviewed for this story, by far the most important step all photographers can take to secure their legacies is to edit and organize their work well. A messy, overloaded archive creates a physical and emotional burden for your heirs or executor, and can lead to extra expenses, such as storage and appraisal. </p>
<p>“I’m often called in because a widow or widower is overwhelmed with the amount of material that has been left by a creative spouse,” says Oregon-based fine-art photography appraiser <a href="http://photostoots.com/">Jennifer L. Stoots</a>. “I’ve walked into huge messes where there’s no discrete inventory, no cataloguing system, just box after box of chaos.”</p>
<p>Even when an archive is well-organized, it can still be overwhelming if it’s large. Mary Engel found this out in 1985 when her mother—the photographer <a href="http://www.orkinphoto.com/">Ruth Orkin</a>—died, leaving Engel as her executor. “She was a conservative shooter, but she kept everything, from articles and pictures she liked to her own writing,” Engel says. “Although it was all very organized, I’m still going through it 30 years later and throwing things out.”</p>
<p>This experience—and her later experience inheriting the archive of her father, photographer and filmmaker <a href="http://www.engelphoto.com/">Morris Engel</a>, in 2005—inspired Engel to found the <a href="http://www.apag.us/">American Photography Archives Group (APAG)</a>, an organization that advises photographers and their heirs about estate issues. “Everyone always asks, what do I keep and what do I throw away?” says Engel. Her advice to photographers thinking about their estate is: “Try to de-clutter before you pass on.” Meanwhile, to heirs, she says: “Don’t try to inventory and digitize absolutely everything: Most likely, you’ll never need to know every single image. Instead, prioritize: Look for the signature photos and the important series.”</p>
<p>For <a href="http://charlesorear.photoshelter.com/">Charles O’Rear</a>, a former <em>National Geographic</em> photographer and book photographer who doesn’t have a history of fine-art print sales, organization means digitizing his best material. “I can’t think why anyone would want to keep old transparencies around,” O’Rear says. Instead, he scans his images and keeps them on two hard drives, one located at each end of his house. “If the house catches fire, it’s likely one will survive,” he says.</p>
<p>One exception to de-cluttering could come if you have a well-known image, or images that have sold well. In that case, making prints of the images before death could create potential value for your heirs. The prints should be signed to prove provenance: either that they are lifetime prints (made during the photographer’s lifetime) or vintage prints (made close to the time the negative was exposed). Renowned civil rights photographer <a href="http://www.bobadelman.net/">Bob Adelman</a> makes a point of doing this on a regular basis. “Taking time every now and again to make prints, and putting them aside, is an important way to increase the value of your work,” he says. </p>
<p><strong>The Legal Mumbo-Jumbo</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve got your archive organized (or even before), you’ll want to set up the legal framework for your estate. The options for this include a standard will, various kinds of trusts or a foundation. Your decision on this will be determined by the type and value of your estate, and your intentions for its use.</p>
<p>Value is a key point. In the last few years, the exemption on estate taxes has gone up considerably: from $1 million for an individual in 2002 to $5.43 million today. In other words, if your estate is worth less than $5.43 million (or $10.86 million if it’s jointly owned with a spouse), you don’t have to worry about estate tax. In which case, “a good will, naming the person who is inheriting your copyright, might be enough,” says appraiser <a href="http://www.ellenboughn.com/">Ellen Boughn</a>. </p>
<p>However, some photographers are choosing to set up a revocable living trust in addition to a will. (Needless to say, estate planning requires the help of a lawyer.) The major advantage of a revocable trust is that when you die, your assets pass directly to your beneficiaries without going through probate—which can be costly and lengthy. “Some states, like California and Florida, have very cumbersome probate processes,” says estate attorney Sarah Johnson. “If you live in one of those states, you really do want a revocable trust.”</p>
<p>San Francisco photographer <a href="http://www.mortonbeebe.com/">Morton Beebe</a>, known for his extensive surveys of San Francisco, Miami and Seattle, is currently in the process of winnowing down his archive. He also set up a revocable living trust in order to avoid probate. “I chose this trust because it avoids my possessions becoming a ward of the state,” he says. </p>
<p>Another kind of trust, the irrevocable living trust, might be suitable for photographers with a taxable estate (over $5.43 million) and assets that are expected to appreciate. Under this kind of trust, you give away assets during your lifetime so that they are no longer part of your estate, and therefore estate tax is avoided. If the beneficiary sells the work later, he or she will have to pay capital gains tax (CGT) on the appreciation—but since CGT is lower than estate tax, it’s still a net gain. </p>
<p>Another option is to set up a private, charitable foundation. “This is something I’d suggest if an artist wants to keep a body of work alive and has no heirs, or the children aren’t interested,” says attorney Sarah Johnson. The advantages of a foundation are that a body of work is secured and can be slowly distributed after death, with no estate tax due. When works are sold, the proceeds are used for charitable purposes. “Typically, you need at least $1 million of value to make a foundation viable,” says Johnson. “You’d need to sell some work or fund it with cash to provide for operating expenses.”  </p>
<p><strong>Working With An Institution</strong></p>
<p>For many photographers, the main reason for preserving an archive is so that their images will continue to be seen. That’s especially the case for photojournalists and others with bodies of work that may be historically rich but don’t have strong sales histories. </p>
<p>If your work falls into that category, part of your estate plan might be to approach a library or museum with an interest in your work’s subject matter. Such institutions might occasionally buy an archive or accept it as a donation. “For a lot of photographers who don’t have huge established markets, regional institutions are a good choice,” says Edward Yee, a photography appraiser with <a href="http://peneloped.com/">Penelope Dixon &amp; Associates</a>. </p>
<p>However, it’s not as easy as choosing an institution and informing them of your choice. “People should know that it’s very expensive for us to house photographers’ negatives, prints and tearsheets,” says Jack von Euw, curator of pictorial collections at <a href="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/">U.C. Berkeley’s Bancroft Library</a>, which specializes in collections about California and the West. Von Euw estimates that a third of the library’s photography collections have been purchased, and two-thirds donated. Even when he purchases a collection, he says, “We can’t purchase it at market value. The main thing is to be able to reassure a photographer that his or her work will have a place and be preserved.” </p>
<p>For photographer <a href="http://www.menuez.com/">Doug Menuez</a>, that reassurance was a key factor in donating his work to Stanford University. Menuez, who documented Silicon Valley in the 1980s and 90s, began talking to Stanford’s library after a history professor invited him to give a talk at the university. “Originally they were going to buy the archive, but then they had budget cuts; we settled on my donating the physical material while keeping the copyrights,” he says. Stanford created a collection in his name, and presented a plan to develop the archive as a resource for scholars. “It was and is a tremendous honor,” Menuez says. “I know how hard it is for photographers to find a home for their work.” </p>
<p>University libraries have approached Adelman about his extensive collection of Civil Rights-era imagery, but he has not signed a deal with any yet. One library did pay for him to have his archive appraised, a complicated process that typically costs upward of $10,000. Adelman anticipates that since his archive is “a unique body of work,” it will end up in an institution. “I’ve always tried to photograph things I thought had historic significance, to make the work valuable,” he says. </p>
<p><strong>Clarity</strong></p>
<p>Whatever your estate plan, being clear about your wishes will make that plan easier to accomplish. In addition to organizing your work, setting up a legal framework, and possibly finding a home for your archive, talking to your heirs and leaving clear instructions can reduce confusion.</p>
<p>“I often advise photographers to talk into a microphone,” says Engel, “not just about your will, but other things. Do you want your archive split up, or kept together? How do you want your work to be remembered?” Intention is important, she says: for example, her mother’s most famous image, <a href="http://www.orkinphoto.com/photographs/american-girl/">“An American Girl in Italy,”</a> has sometimes been used without permission to illustrate sexual harassment. But since “it was the 1950s when my mother shot it, and that’s not how she or the woman in the picture felt,” Engel doesn’t allow the photograph to be used that way. </p>
<p>Stoots, who says she’s witnessed “a lot of sad stories of overburdened family members and friends,” has brought together and moderated panels of attorneys, curators and tax specialists in Los Angeles and Portland. On April 15, 2014, she will moderate a similar panel at B&amp;H Photo Video in New York. (See details at <a href="http://photostoots.com/upcoming-lectures-public-talks./">photostoots.com/upcoming-lectures-public-talks</a>.) “It’s about finding best practices, and making life easier for those who inherit the work,” she says. </p>
<p>If all this seems morbid, it’s important to remember that there’s a silver lining. Though photography estates can be complicated, they can also be a source of great joy for heirs—especially when they’re set up well. “It was hard for me in the beginning—just emotionally, hard to get started,” says Engel. “But to get positive responses from people, and to see my parents’ work still known and loved—well, that’s wonderful.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[In a sense, <em><a href="http://a-way-to-go.com/">Way to Go</a> </em>is a film. It has a beginning, an end, and moving images captured by a camera. But it’s also a game, where the player controls a blockheaded animated figure, deciding whether to walk, run, stop, jump, fly or investigate elements in the 360-degree live-action environment. And as part of the newest crop of interactive filmmaking on display at 2015’s Sundance Film Festival, it’s helping change the way we think about storytelling with moving pictures. 
<p>“The way we move around when we’re traveling is very different than when we move around in everyday life,” says <a href="http://docubase.mit.edu/curator/hugues-sweeney/">Hugues Sweeney</a>, the project’s executive producer. In <em>Way to Go</em>—which is free to play at <a href="http://a-way-to-go.com/">a-way-to-go.com</a>—the speed with which players move along a path changes what they see and the music they hear. “Some things might happen that might never have happened if you walked super-fast,” Sweeney says. “The idea was creating these moments and giving this context for moments of hyper-lucidity.”</p>
<p><em>Way to Go</em> mixes video footage shot with a DIY pole-mounted 360-degree camera rig comprised of six GoPros and hand-drawn animation, rendering graphics in your Web browser in real-time. The interactive video is the brainchild of <a href="http://www.aatoaa.com/">AATOAA</a>, a Montreal-based digital studio led by <a href="http://vincentmorisset.com/">Vincent Morisset</a>, an interactive filmmaker with video credits for musicians like Sigur Ros and Arcade Fire as well as commercial clients like Google and Red Bull. <em>Way to Go</em> is also funded by the <a href="https://www.nfb.ca/">National Film Board of Canada (NFB)</a>, which dedicates 25 percent of its yearly allocation to interactive productions. </p>
<p>Sweeney has overseen all the projects produced by the NFB’s Montreal branch for the past five years. When he and Morisset spoke to <em>PDN </em>via Skype, they were in Park City, Utah, demoing a Virtual Reality adaptation of the project at <a href="http://www.sundance.org/programs/new-frontier">Sundance’s New Frontier Story Lab</a>, an incubator for interactive and VR storytelling. And while they got some attention from the tech world for demoing the interactive video on the Oculus Rift headset, <em>Way to Go </em>is just the latest of several innovative interactive projects from the NFB.</p>
<p>The NFB is government-funded, but that hasn’t kept Sweeney from green-lighting productions that investigate the actions of the government. In 2013’s <em><a href="http://www.fortmcmoney.com/#/fortmcmoney">Fort McMoney</a></em>, <a href="http://opendoclab.mit.edu/david-dufresne">David Dufresne</a> uses first-person video to take a micro view of Fort McMurray, a boomtown that has sprung up near Alberta’s massive tar sands reserve. The extraction of tar sands oil—which is sent to refineries in the Midwest and on the Gulf of Mexico via pipeline—is a hot-button issue involving government interests, so diligent fact-checking was crucial. But making <em>Fort McMoney</em> would prove to be more complicated than just getting the facts straight. </p>
<p>Dufresne had just moved to Canada when he pitched <em>Fort McMoney</em> as an interactive “docu-game,” hoping to combat what Sweeney calls Canada’s “green fatigue”—public apathy towards environmental issues brought on by media saturation. Sweeney had been a fan of Dufresne and Philippe Brault’s <em><a href="http://prisonvalley.arte.tv/?lang=en">Prison Valley</a></em>, an interactive documentary that explored the prison industrial complex in Ca&ntilde;on City, Colorado. Not unlike <em>Prison Valley</em>, <em>Fort McMoney</em> uses a first-person perspective to let players explore the town and hear interviews with residents and business owners about how the local industry affects the town, the country and the rest of the world. The filmmakers’ goal is to stoke educated discourse without pushing easy answers.</p>
<p>“The proposal of <em>Fort McMoney</em> is really about the audience taking control of the city, and making decisions about the city as they go through it,” Sweeney says. “I think it’s easy to just say ‘oil is bad,’ to get in a very polarized discourse about the exploitation of oil. The real issue is, on the one hand, the equilibrium between the economy and the environment. But to me the most interesting thing is how we behave as individuals.”</p>
<p>How the audience behaves and the decisions they make while playing <em>Fort McMoney</em> determine the outcome of the game. Individual players are in control, but only partly; the control is collective. While the interface is single-player, the experience is anything but. If you decide to turn Fort McMurray into a ghost town, but the rest of the audience wants to make it the Las Vegas of the north, the neon lights are inevitable. </p>
<p>“This is a collective game, because you cannot change the world alone or a city alone, you need other people to do it,” Dufresne explains. “That’s the reason why on <em>Prison Valley</em> or in <em>Fort McMoney</em>, you can always see how many players are playing the game at the same time.”</p>
<p>Dufresne got to watch the collective discourse play out in real-time, thanks to a partnership with the Canadian newspaper <em>The Globe and Mail,</em> which assigned two journalists to play the game and featured the project on the front page of its website.</p>
<p>“They talked to the leaders of government [for the paper] each Sunday,” says Dufresne, “like, ‘What’s going on in <em>Fort McMoney</em>? If what happened in <em>Fort McMoney </em>was reality, what could it be?’ You know, <em>The Globe and Mail</em> is more conservative than progressive, and it was very interesting because they posted a lot of investigation about the tar sands in parallel with the game.” </p>
<p>Now, with legislation looming concerning the proposed Keystone XL pipeline—which would increase the flow of oil from Alberta’s tar sands to refineries in the U.S.—the global influence of Fort McMurray is even more prominent. </p>
<p><em>Fort McMoney</em> is reality-based, while <em>Way to Go</em> lives in the realm of the senses. Both projects have creative teams that come from the film industry, but Dufresne also found inspiration in video games, which have exploded into a multi-billion-dollar business. </p>
<p>“The video game industry changed the narrative 20 years ago,” says Dufresne, whose next interactive project will be on FIFA, the international governing body of soccer. “It’s very interesting, as a filmmaker, to see how the video game industry tells its stories. So we can borrow, we can take some aspects from the video game industry. It’s not an obligation to make a game. But you can use one or two ideas.” </p>
<p>With <em>Way to Go</em>, Morisset says he wants “someone that’s five years old to dig it, but also I want my mom to be able to press the button and see how it works, but I also want my geek friends to be like ‘Oh, this is amazing!’” It’s the same diverse demographic that the video game industry now serves. </p>
<p>When Dufresne spoke with <em>PDN</em> via Skype, he was looking out his window at <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-US/">Ubisoft</a>, one of Montreal’s largest game studios. He imagines interactive filmmakers someday providing research and development for the multi-billion-dollar video games industry; if that happens, Dufresne thinks there could be more money for the filmmakers working in tandem with gamers. </p>
<p>“We are on the same bridge, maybe one of these days we meet,” says Dufresne. “I think it could be very interesting. Because if we can get the skills, the money, the budget from the game industry, that could be very, very interesting for the documentary.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.stephaniebergerphoto.com/">Stephanie Berger</a> helps cultural and performance institutions around the New York City area sell tickets to theater, dance and classical music events by capturing decisive moments of performances. 
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Who are some of your clients, and how do they use your images?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stephanie Berger:</strong> I get hired by major cultural institutions like Lincoln Center, Brooklyn Academy of Music, Park Avenue Armory and Carnegie Hall, and directly by dance companies, orchestras, and theater companies. They want photos [for promotions] to get people to buy tickets. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How did you get interested in performing arts as a photographic subject?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> I’ve always been interested in music and dance. When I was growing up, we used to go to a lot of concerts. When I was in college, I was on the concert committee and photographed live performances. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How did you start photographing performing arts and artists professionally? </strong></p>
<p><strong>SB: </strong>When I first got out of school I worked at AP as a photo researcher. [Later] I became a photographer for the New York City Department of Transportation. I had great access to everything in New York City.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: You were photographing performances on the side?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB: </strong>Yes, I did it without getting paid for it. But my photographs started getting published a lot, and I started working for the Lincoln Center Out of Doors festival. I showed work to <em>The New York Times</em> because I’d always wanted to work for their culture desk, and they started hiring me as a freelancer in 1991 or 1992. From there it all just sort of blossomed. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What’s most appealing to you about photographing performing arts?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB: </strong>You get to see the sweat, you get to see the muscles, you get to see artistic beauty and photograph it. I feel this engagement with performers. New York City has the greatest artists coming through, so it’s amazing, and I get to photograph it.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What is your goal?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> It is to make a dynamic photograph at the decisive moment. I’m not just trying to document it, but I’m trying to bring it to another level, and hopefully I’m making another piece of art.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Do you have to know the work being performed to accomplish that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> No, I usually walk in cold.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How did you learn to anticipate the decisive moments?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> It’s an instinct. You can see and feel that it’s coming. I have a good sense of rhythm and a good eye, and I’ve been around in this world long enough so I can feel when that moment’s going to come.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What’s the most challenging thing about this type of work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> There are two things. One is the lighting. It can be extremely dark, and people are moving fast, and you have to use available light.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you handle that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> It’s much easier than it used to be. I work at ISO 4000 sometimes. You can hand-hold a lot more than you could with film, and I don’t mind blur. Sometimes that enhances a photo. What I’m trying to capture in a photograph is the feeling of movement. But I also try to get it so there’s a sharp edge to it. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What’s the other challenge?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> You can’t make noise and often you can’t move around very much. So I have a sound blimp, and I’m often stationed in one place. Carnegie Hall is limited. You can sit in the back of the house, but sometimes you miss a shot because [the performance] is too quiet and you can’t shoot at that moment, even with the blimp.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: The blimp isn’t quiet enough?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> It’s a soft blimp, so it’s not totally silent. Those audiences are tough. I’ve had people turn around and yell, “You’re disturbing me!” and I’ve been thrown out of theaters. But things are getting better now because the cameras have a quiet mode, and now some cameras have silent modes.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What’s in your camera bag? </strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> I’m a Nikon girl. I always carry two bodies: a D3 and a D800. I have two lenses I use all the time: my 24–70 f/2.8 and my 80–200 f/2.8. I use a tripod a lot with a heavy-duty ball head. I also have a 300mm lens that I use when I have to shoot from the back of the house. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Do you do other kinds of work besides performing arts? </strong></p>
<p><strong>SB: </strong>I’m known in this world [of performing arts], so I’m busy all the time. It could be a portrait, a dress rehearsal, a performance, or a benefit event. I also shoot a lot for PBS. I recently shot a <em>Downton Abbey</em> event in New York for a social media campaign, and I’m going out to Los Angeles to shoot promotional photos for PBS’s spring program lineup.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What’s the competition like for performing arts work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> I’ve been lucky. I’ve had many clients for a long time, but there are really talented people coming up, getting work you thought you would get, so you have to play the game, and make a deal [on fees].</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What are the rates?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> Usually it’s a day rate, but I’m not comfortable discussing my fees. I have different scales for different clients and [what I charge] depends on many factors so I don’t want to state what my minimum is because that can be misread.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Are there secondary markets for your work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB: </strong>Yes, I sell a lot of prints. Performers and set designers sometimes want pictures for their own portfolios, so I will license photos for that. And I sell to textbooks—not a lot, though. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What advice would you give to photographers who aspire to make a living photographing the performing arts?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> You have to have [credentials] to shoot in major venues, but there are many different small venues that you can shoot in [to start]. Photograph what you love so you show your passion…be it for dance, music, hip hop, ballet, electronica, experimental theater. Find young performing artists that you can collaborate with, who need cool photos for their press and websites. And don’t give [your work] away! </p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Distribution is one of the paramount challenges for photojournalists, and some seek help from photo agencies. Getty Images, one of the industry’s distribution powerhouses, represents about 50 photojournalists through its <a href="http://www.reportagebygettyimages.com/">Reportage division</a>. They rely on the agency for editorial assignments as well as distribution of their personal projects in publications all over the world. 
<p>So who are those photographers, and how do they get on Getty’s roster?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.worldpressphoto.org/aidan-sullivan">Aidan Sullivan</a>—Getty’s vice president of photo assignment, editorial partnerships and development—says the Reportage division offers opportunities for photojournalists at different career stages. His staff of 12 editors is constantly looking for talent. “It’s all about preparing the next generation [of photojournalists], and looking for new approaches to photojournalism,” he says.</p>
<p>He emphasizes that Reportage is a separate division from Getty Images Editorial, a wire service that employs staff and contract photographers for breaking news, sports and entertainment coverage. Reportage is also distinct from Getty Images Assignment, which represents photographers for corporate and commercial work.</p>
<p>Reportage photographers work on a variety of assignments and personal projects. Last year, their coverage ranged from the Ebola crisis in Africa to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the rise of ISIS to civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, to name just a few examples.</p>
<p>Getty divides Reportage photographers into three categories: a small, elite group of seasoned photojournalists with exclusive contracts, called Represented Photographers; a second, larger tier of so-called Featured Contributors on non-exclusive contracts; and a third category called Emerging Talent. </p>
<p>The latter is a one-year opportunity for photographers at the very start of their careers to prove themselves, showcase their work and learn from a Getty editor assigned as a mentor. Getty invites up to a dozen or so photographers into the program each year. Currently, the Emerging Talent roster includes <a href="http://www.alecegarra.com/">Alejandro Cegarra</a>, <a href="http://www.antoinebruy.com/">Antoine Bruy</a>, <a href="http://maddiemcgarvey.com/">Maddie McGarvey</a>, <a href="http://www.reportagebygettyimages.com/corinna-kern/">Corinna Kern</a>, <a href="http://sebastianmontalvog.com/">Sebastian Montalvo Gray</a>, <a href="http://www.reportagebygettyimages.com/elyor-nematov/">Elyor Nematov</a> and <a href="http://www.andrewrenneisen.com/home">Andrew Renneisen</a>.</p>
<p>To be eligible, photographers must be under 30 years of age, with few publications, no major awards, and no agency representation. Photographers may apply for admission to the program. This year’s deadline is May 13, 2015 (see <a href="http://imagery.gettyimages.com/getty_images_grants/Emerging.html">imagery.gettyimages.com/getty_images_grants/Emerging.html</a> for details).</p>
<p>Sullivan and his staff are on the lookout all year long for emerging talent. They find eligible photographers on social media, at portfolio reviews held at events such as <a href="http://www.visapourlimage.com/index.do;jsessionid=InsIAvJWjuzUILcLfYSJr4F3">Visa Pour l’Image</a> (in Perpignan, France) and at the <a href="http://www.ianparry.org/scholarship/">Ian Parry Scholarship</a> competition, which supports promising photographers age 24 and younger. </p>
<p>“We often [invite] five or six photographers every year from the Ian Parry Scholarship” entries, says Sullivan, who is chairman and founder of the Ian Parry Foundation. </p>
<p>Cegarra, for instance, won the 2014 Ian Parry Scholarship. <a href="http://www.sebastianliste.com/">Sebastian Liste</a>—represented until recently by Reportage—began as an Emerging Talent photographer after winning the Ian Parry Scholarship in 2010. <a href="http://www.edouphoto.com/">Ed Ou</a>, a Featured Contributor, also started in the Emerging Talent program after winning an honorable mention in the Ian Parry competition in 2010.</p>
<p>Getty doesn’t actively promote the work of Emerging Talent photographers, but the agency watches to see which ones produce. Sullivan says that overall, about 20 percent of Emerging Talent photographers are invited to continue working with Getty as Featured Contributors.</p>
<p>Besides Ou and Liste, others who have been promoted recently include <a href="http://www.dianamarkosian.com/open">Diana Markosian</a>, <a href="http://www.saranaomiphoto.com/">Sara Naomi Lewkowicz</a>, <a href="http://www.shannon-jensen.com/">Shannon Jensen</a> and <a href="http://www.natnacphotography.com/">Natalie Naccache</a>.</p>
<p>“The Emerging Talent program is about how much effort you put in,” says Naccache, who was invited into the program in 2012, after showing her portfolio to Getty editors at Visa Pour l’Image. “I was always busy with photo projects, and I updated Getty every week. I would also update them on any assignments, and show them tear sheets, just so they’d know my progress.”</p>
<p>Her efforts eventually led to an invitation last year to join Reportage’s roster of <a href="http://www.reportagebygettyimages.com/featured-photographers/">Featured Contributors</a>. As a result, she says, “I have been getting more assignments, and more assignments abroad. The support network is important as well. Patrick Llewellyn, my editor, used to work for the <em>Sunday Times Magazine</em>, so he gives me perspective from a picture editor’s point of view.”</p>
<p>Sullivan describes the Featured Contributors as those who are “very established, able to find their own work and just need our help with syndication.” He notes that Reportage is responsible for all the story packaging and marketing, freeing contract photographers from all of those tasks. “What they need to do is give us the tools” to market their work—specifically, strong visual narratives with a wide edit, Sullivan says.</p>
<p>Currently, there are about 30 Featured Contributors. Besides those already mentioned, they include veterans <a href="http://kennerly.com/">David Hume Kennerly</a>, <a href="http://www.charlesommanney.com/">Charles Ommaney</a>, <a href="http://www.robertnickelsberg.com/">Robert Nickelsberg</a> and <a href="http://www.rezaphoto.org/">Reza</a>, to name a few. </p>
<p>Photographers may remain on the Featured Contributors roster as long as they continue to produce, Sullivan says. “We review the roster once a year to see how things are progressing.” He also says the Featured Photographer program “is rather like dating and then seeing if you want to get married”—that is, to advance to Represented Photographer status, with an exclusive contract. (Currently there are 16 Represented Photographers, among them <a href="http://www.lynseyaddario.com/">Lynsey Addario</a>, <a href="http://www.benlowy.com/">Benjamin Lowy</a>, <a href="http://www.danielberehulak.com/">Daniel Berehulak</a> and other top photojournalists.) </p>
<p>Reportage editors find Featured Contributors in much the same way they find Emerging Talent: at contests, portfolio reviews, and photo festivals. <a href="http://edouardelias.com/">Edouard Elias</a>, for instance, was recently invited to join after he showed his work from Syria to a Getty editor at the Visa Pour l’Image festival.</p>
<p>Sullivan also encourages interested photographers to contact him by email. “I’ve always said: Just ask. When photographers email me to ask me to look at their work, I always do,” he says.</p>
<p>Competition for representation is stiff, though. Editors “speak to many hundreds of photographers throughout the year,” Sullivan says. They’re looking for “extraordinary talent,” reflected in photographers’ depth of knowledge, their experience, and their ability to create a visual narrative.</p>
<p>Getty also considers the geographic location of applicants in order to avoid conflicts among its contributors. “North America would be less open because we have a lot of photographers we represent here,” Sullivan says. “But South and Central America are open. We also look [at photographers from] Eastern Europe.”</p>
<p>His parting advice for photographers who want representation is: “Look at the standards we are working with,” by studying the work on Getty’s Reportage website. “Look at the features, and how we edit them so they’re ready to be packaged and sold. Study photographers we have on board, and emulate what they’re doing—but do it in your own style, in your own way.”</p>
<p>In short, if you want distribution, start by doing outstanding work. Did we say this was going to be easy?</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[In June 1995, after the 997th confirmed suicide from the Golden Gate Bridge, the city of San Francisco stopped keeping an official tally. If they hoped this might stem the tide of people who come to the bridge intending to end their lives, they were wrong. Unofficially, the death toll surpassed 1,600 in 2012, making it the second most popular “suicide destination” in the world, trailing only China’s Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge. 
<p><a href="http://www.donnajwan.com/index/#/death-wooed-us/">“Death Wooed Us,”</a> landscape photographer <a href="http://www.donnajwan.com/">Donna J. Wan’s</a> beautiful and unsettling new project, was borne out of a moment on the Golden Gate Bridge Bridge in 2012. “My husband and I were driving across and I was looking out at the beautiful views of the bay and landscape,” she explains, “I knew it was one of the most famous places for committing suicide, so I began to think about why suicidal people choose the particular places that they do to end their lives.”</p>
<p>Wan was recovering from postpartum depression following the birth of her daughter in 2011. Her memories of that time are still foggy, but Wan says that while she had faced depression before, nothing prepared her for the “blinding desperation” of that experience. In the depths of her illness she began to experience suicidal ideation, often centered on the idea of traveling to specific places on the California coast off of Highway 1 and jumping off a cliff into the water below. These were places she had long thought of as exceptionally beautiful and peaceful, so in that moment on the Golden Gate Bridge, Wan had a new understanding of what, perhaps, drew so many people to end their lives there. </p>
<p>That night Wan told her husband the ideas she was mulling over for the new body of work and was taken aback when his initial reaction was negative. “Partly this was due to the fact that he didn’t want to revisit that traumatic time in our lives,” she remembers, “but he was also concerned that others wouldn’t understand my intentions.” Eventually he came around, which Wan says was crucial not just for moral support, but because her husband is the only person she shares her work with before it’s completed. </p>
<p>Her previous two projects were also centered on human interaction with the natural world. Still, she knew going in that this would be a very different sort of project. “This is the most personal work I’ve ever done and that means I am a lot more vulnerable [as a result],” Wan says.</p>
<p>Pragmatism dictated that Wan shoot locally, given that she had a young child. She did venture outside the Bay Area, but as the project progressed she came to feel that shooting in areas she could visit repeatedly—and consistently develop a connection to—produced better images than “helicoptering in” somewhere. In order to find the locations, Wan would do research online, using news stories about traffic jams caused by jumpers and reports of bodies found on beaches. </p>
<p>“I didn’t have preconceived notions of how the photos would turn out, I just knew what I wanted to explore,” Wan says. “I didn’t understand my own attraction [to the places and to the project], I was trying to understand it all and going to these places, I felt...almost a chill. But then there was also a beauty and grace.” She scouted and shot all the locations alone, not wanting anything to distract from the connection she sought with her subject. </p>
<p>As emotionally draining as the shoots were, Wan’s greatest challenge came after she shared the work. Images from “Death Wooed Us” were featured on <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/04/donna-j-wan-death-wooed-us/">Wired.com</a> in May 2014, and some of the comments were caustic. She had been prepared for accusations of romanticizing suicide but not accusations that the work was exploitative, or, in a sad bit of irony, that she didn’t know what it was like to be suicidal. Wan admits she let it “get her down.” But as she’s shown the project in other venues, she has seen more positive reactions, and learned how to better absorb the negative ones. </p>
<p>Sharing the project with people in person has also given her valuable perspective. Often, whether with friends, colleagues or perfect strangers, people have divulged their own experiences with suicide. “I realized that this project gave some people the space to feel like they could talk about their experiences with someone who would not shy away from the subject,” Wan explains. “Even after I had gone through the worst of my postpartum depression, I felt like I still couldn’t really talk to others about my experience.... When people who have seen this work suddenly open up to me and tell me about their experiences, I feel honored that they feel comfortable enough to tell me something that they hold so close to them.”</p>
<p>At press time Wan was preparing for an exhibition of “Death Wooed Us” at <a href="http://www.rickwesterfineart.com/">Rick Wester Fine Art</a> in New York City, which runs from March 19 through April 25. Wan still doesn’t know if the project is finished. She becomes emotional when talking about the last picture she took for the series, on a beach where a young man drowned himself. As a new parent, it was an especially difficult shoot, she says. “It was just so sad. Maybe that was the last one.”</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Few issues encompass the challenges facing humanity in the 21st century like water scarcity. Food production, climate change, forced migration, military conflicts and other critical issues are connected by anxiety over water supplies. Life simply can’t exist without fresh water, and billions of people are struggling for access. Further, our increasingly inhospitable world has shown through drought, flooding and other ecological disasters just how quickly livable land can be snatched away from large populations.
<p>Imperiled water resources is one of the themes in <a href="http://www.samaalshaibi.com/Silsila">“Silsila,”</a> a series of photographs and videos by <a href="http://www.samaalshaibi.com/">Sama Alshaibi</a> that will be exhibited this spring at <a href="http://www.ayyamgallery.com/">Ayyam Gallery</a>, London, and which are included in a new monograph, <em><a href="http://aperture.org/shop/alshaibi-sand-rushes-in-book">Sand Rushes In</a></em>, published this spring by Aperture. </p>
<p>“Silsila” is an Arabic word meaning chain or link. The series grew from Alshaibi’s interests in “the root causes of war.” An American citizen of Iraqi and Palestinian heritage, Alshaibi has lived in Arizona since accepting a teaching position at University of Arizona in 2006. Early in her tenure there, she noted that experts from states in the Middle East were traveling to Arizona to study water management and city planning. Through research she understood that water is a factor that shapes political and social conflicts. “It’s really about a hoarding practice,” Alshaibi says. “It’s human nature to try to survive for yourself and the immediate group around you.”</p>
<p>To create the “Silsila” photographs and videos, Alshaibi retraced the route of 14th century Muslim traveller Ibn Battuta, working in major deserts and critical bodies of water in North Africa and the Middle East. Battuta’s travels through the Muslim world and subsequent stories “gave voice to communities and shared values, linking their stories with his,” Alshaibi explains in an interview in <em>Sand Rushes In</em>. While resources have caused conflicts—and will continue to do so—Alshaibi notes that the struggle for them is a commonality that transcends political borders, religion and other points of difference. “If anything,” she says, “‘Silsila’ is a sort of plea for us to look beyond these [divisive] issues.”</p>
<p>The images and videos, some of which were exhibited at the Venice Biennale in 2013, often depict a lone figure in deserts and oases. Clad mostly in black and often wrapped in green, blue, white or red scarves, the figure moves and gestures within the stark landscapes. In both the photographs and video pieces, we see the figure holding or releasing feathers into the wind, a reference to “migration and people in flight.”</p>
<p>Through reflections in bodies of water, or through postproduction mirroring effects, Alshaibi plays with themes of repetition and cycles of history, turning her photographs and videos in on themselves. At times her process results in complex geometric images that reference Islamic Art, mathematics and science. </p>
<p>Alshaibi’s decision to work in harsh desert environments is particularly apt. Desertification, defined as “the persistent degradation of dryland ecosystems by variations in climate and human activities,” is chief among water-related concerns facing global populations. “The effects of desertification are increasingly felt globally as victims turn into refugees, internally displaced people and forced migrants or they turn to radicalization, extremism or resource-driven wars for survival,” notes a 2014 report issued by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.</p>
<p>While Alshaibi is the figure in the photographs and videos, her face is mostly obscured, making her more of a universal character. “The land is the protagonist and the water is the protagonist,” she explains. “There is a figure that may come into these images that has to negotiate and live with harmony in this space,” a reflection of human experience on earth. “Throughout time, that sort of relationship to land has always been there,” she says. “In harmony or disharmony, you’re always subjected to it.”</p>
<p>Alshaibi was traveling in areas to which she had no connection and which were essentially unknown to her, where it was difficult to communicate. She was often dropped off to do her work, trusting that her drivers would return for her eight or nine hours later. “What amazed me was that I found that the very simple ideas of being human, of gratitude, of graciousness, of caring, of alertness, of paying attention to difference but actually working on commonalities, is what made it work in all that migration through all those spaces,” she says.</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Since moving to Istanbul, Turkey, not long after graduating from New York University, <a href="http://www.moniquejaques.com/">Monique Jaques</a> has been interested in what she calls “Islamic Fashion.” Recent changes in the Turkish government spawned a nascent market to serve a new demographic of rich Muslim women with expensive tastes. It was while covering this beat that the photographer first heard of the Miss World Muslimah beauty pageant, in a short item on CNN.
<p>“I was like ‘What? How did this escape my radar?’” she recalls. The pageant, held in Indonesia, is an international competition for affluent Muslim women who are judged on their beauty, piety and intelligence. She marked the date on her calendar, and pitched <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/profiles/r/mark-rykoff.html">Mark Rykoff</a>, senior photo editor at Al Jazeera America.</p>
<p>Rykoff had previously assigned Jaques work in Turkey and Georgia for Al Jazeera, and he had also worked with her as a photo editor at Time.com. His only concern about assigning the Miss World Muslimah story was that her access would be limited. Jaques assured him she would have full access, and Rykoff was sold. </p>
<p>“It sounded really interesting, and much more compelling [than most pageant stories]” Rykoff says. “It would allow the writer to talk to the women involved and get a lot closer to the story.”</p>
<p>Rykoff flew Jaques to Indonesia in November 2014 to meet with Kate Lamb, a local reporter assigned to the story. Jaques, who has done long-term projects on Muslim women—on the female Sufi mystics of Georgia and the women of Gaza—got to the pageant ahead of Lamb and quickly bonded with the contestants. She likened the pageant schedule—which had the contestants working 18-hour days—to a summer camp experience. “You bond with people really fast, you know?” she says. “Anything where you’re together all day, you get to the end of the day and you feel like you’ve lived five days. By the end of the [first] day, I was in.”</p>
<p>The women would rise at 4 a.m. for morning prayers, then go straight into makeup, and then a Koran reading. Their first public appearances started at 7 a.m.; they would spend much of the day travelling by bus to various press events, as well as to photo ops at retail establishments. The women were all English-speaking and educated. They had careers as doctors, accountants and businesswomen. Active social media users, they were also religious, and debated issues such as whether the laws of Islam permitted nail polish.</p>
<p>Jaques didn’t spend much time shooting the actual contest; it was the in-between moments where she captured the spirit of the women she was following. </p>
<p>“That’s what made it such a good story,” Jaques says. “The time on the bus, when they’re away from their handlers. That’s when they’re like, ‘This is stupid!’ That’s the funny thing about the pageant, they totally knew what was going on. They saw through it.”</p>
<p>Jaques found the assignment fun; her biggest challenge was maintaining her objectivity. “It really was just an embed, you know…an embed with beauty queens. You become really good friends with everyone, and you have to work to keep up your own impartiality.”</p>
<p>Al Jazeera trusted her to cover the story as she saw fit. When she got back to Istanbul, she pared her shots down to a rough edit of about 250 photos. “I just couldn’t decide,” she admits. “My head was so far in it, I couldn’t determine what wasn’t essential.” Rykoff looked at the rough edit, then asked for 30 hi-res files. Then he worked with Jaques on the final edit, selecting 15 images that ran on <a href="http://projects.aljazeera.com/2014/miss-muslimah/">Al Jazeera America’s website.</a> </p>
<p>The response to the story was positive, and Time.com ran a photo on its Lightbox blog. But the organizer wasn’t as pleased with Lamb and Jaques’ honest take on the event, texting Jaques: “Your report destroys me…I lost sponsors.”</p>
<p>“I think she was quite upset by the frankness of the story,” Jaques admits.</p>
<p>But Rykoff was impressed—with Jacques’ sense of color, composition and layering, but mostly with her ability to tell the story. “She approached [it] thinking in terms of how to tell a story through photos,” Rykoff says. “I often talk about it being like a movie: There’s a close-up shot, scenes that are shot, and you have characters who pull the narrative along. All those things were present there in her pictures.” </p>
<p>Indonesia—the country with the most Muslims in the world—has far weightier issues and concerns than a beauty pageant, but for an up-and-comer like Jaques, it’s the ancillary stories that have been paying the bills.</p>
<p>“Who is gonna hire me [to shoot a conflict] when they can hire <a href="http://www.fabiobucciarelli.com/">Fabio Bucciarelli</a>?” she says, referring to the winner of the 2012 Robert Capa Medal. “What I started doing is looking for really different things—figuring out what’s going on around the conflict.”</p>]]></article_text>

<p>“Groups are probably one of the hardest things to shoot,” <a href="http://jakechessum.com/">Jake Chessum</a> says. The portrait photographer has been hired by editorial, commercial and corporate clients to bring his exuberant portrait style to photographs of actors, filmmakers, athletes and musicians. There are many challenges to corralling several subjects at once, he says. “It may sound stupid, but remembering everyone’s name is right up there, especially when you have to direct someone. What are you going to say: ‘Hey, third guy from the left?’”</p>
<p>For a holiday promotional mailer for Cole Haan, Chessum was hired to photograph the funk and soul band <a href="http://www.sharonjonesandthedapkings.com/">Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings</a>. Chessum had worked on the shoe company’s previous holiday ads, making upbeat portraits of individual artists and leaders. For the new promotion, he says, “They wanted it to look loose and reflect the personalities of the members of the band,” both in individual portraits and in a group photo of the musicians. Chessum would photograph them on a 42-foot cyclorama at Pier 59 studios in New York City, near the set where the band was simultaneously shooting a video promotion. The photographer would have only a few minutes for each portrait session, pulling band members onto his set whenever there was a break in the video shoot.  </p>
<p>Chessum’s goal was to shoot one group portrait in-camera, and capture enough material to composite a second group portrait from four to five plates. Chessum organized every aspect of the shoot, from the lighting to directing, to help keep the energy and attention of his subjects from flagging while he captured multiple variations. </p>
<p><strong>Logistics</strong></p>
<p>The Cole Haan still shoot was a big production, with stylists and their assistants, seamstresses, clients, the band’s management, a digital tech and Chessum’s own assistants on the set. </p>
<p>When shooting portraits, Chessum will typically try to shoot several frames quickly. “Sometimes you have to crank it out, because it’s the first few minutes where they’re more loose, before they get bored or in a rut.” </p>
<p>In his in-camera group portrait of the musicians playing instruments, some of the subjects’ faces were blocked, “but it was as much about spontaneity as everyone looking good.” </p>
<p>To make the images for the composite shot, he would grab groups of two or three Dap-Kings as they were freed up from the video shoot, shooting as many variations as he could. He couldn’t be sure what order he would shoot the subjects in, and didn’t have a layout for the final composite. He notes, “Sharon had to be in the middle,” he says, “but other than that it was wide open.” As he directed each small group, he had to anticipate how the shots might fit together in the composite. “We tried to comp it together in our heads because we didn’t really have time to comp it on the set, and just try to get as many variations within the parameters of time.” As he directed the subjects, he explains, “Sometimes you’d say: Look at your imaginary friend just to your left, or look around and pretend that Sharon’s next to you.” </p>
<p>The musicians were game, he says. “If you’re shooting a corporate group where there’s a hierarchy they need to maintain or they need to be respectful of the boss, that can become more staged and stiff,” he says. With the Dap-Kings, “You assume that having been together so long, there’s a good group dynamic.” </p>
<p><strong>Lighting</strong></p>
<p>Chessum and his assistants first lit the back wall of the cyc, “not to blast it, but to give it some fill.” They placed two bare Profoto heads on stands close to the background but set wide apart, outside the frame of the image, and bounced them into v-flats. </p>
<p>To light his subjects, Chessum wanted a broad light source, “to make sure they have freedom to move, so they don’t feel tied down, and provide latitude so if someone runs forward or back a few feet it’s still ok.” </p>
<p>Chessum and his crew hung a 12 x 12 silk vertically, about 10 feet from the subjects, then placed a continuous Briese Focus 180 behind it. Chessum calls it a “great single-light source: crisp, beautiful.” The light was placed at a slight angle, to add some modeling to the faces. When photographing individual portraits, Chessum’s assistants brought in flags and baffles to accentuate shadows as needed. </p>
<p><strong>Camera</strong></p>
<p>Chessum shot with a Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III with a 24-70mm zoom, “which we locked off at somewhere between 50- and 60mm” to maintain consistent focal length in the images that were used for the composite. Chessum estimates he shot at 1/160 sec at f/11, ISO 100. Chessum was about eight feet from the subjects, he says. “You want to be close enough to yell and maintain the flow of communication.”</p>
<p>The tripod was locked down, its position marked on the floor to help make sure there were no subtle movements that could affect the consistency of the plates. </p>
<p>“The cheat with this is that you shoot on a focal length where there’s not much distortion on the lens. You basically shoot everyone in the middle of the frame, so in post you can move them around afterwards without any distortion.” To prepare for compositing in postproduction, he shot extra space on either side of the subjects, and also made plates of the empty cyc wall. </p>
<p>The digital tech on the Cole Haan shoot was <a href="http://pippadrummond.com/">Pippa Drummond</a>. Though Chessum always shoots tethered, he rarely checks the monitor himself, because he wants to maintain his constant communication with his subjects. “I would rather not leave the set and interrupt the flow. I trust my tech to shout out if something’s wrong or there’s a mistake,” he says. When he routinely shot film, he recalls, “I was constantly fussing over Polaroids. Maybe it’s age or confidence, but I find with digital, if it looks good through the lens, I trust it.”</p>
<p>He also keeps the monitor out of sight of his subjects. “We try to build a little fort around the tech,” Chessum says. “There are shoots where the publicist is looking at the screen, the talent looks at them, and then tries to judge from their facial expression how good or bad this is, and I hate that.”</p>
<p><strong>Postproduction</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to editing his images, Chessum says, “I prefer not to look at them for a day or two if I can avoid it. You need time to get away from it to look at them differently.” When he sits down to the task, he likes to work in Adobe Bridge. “I start by putting a star on the ones I sort of like, then two stars on the ones I like a bit more. If there’s any comping or head-swapping to be done, I put a note on that and start putting them together.” </p>
<p>He typically reviews his choices and sends JPEGs to one of his regular retouchers, who then return TIFF files for him to review, comment on, and send back for more revisions. For this campaign, Cole Haan took his edit and handled the retouching. </p>
<p>He says that an “unexpected benefit” of shooting digitally is that he carries his shoot on his laptop, and spends more time working on color, contrast and compositing. “With film, I’d mark up the contact sheets and pass them onto the printer.” He enjoys the hands-on experience of working on digital files, he says. “I think it’s helped me creatively.”</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Since 2008, <a href="http://www.stuartpilkington.co.uk/">Stuart Pilkington</a> has produced numerous collaborative projects with photographers around the world. When he first started, he was seeking to further his own photographic education. (<a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/Cooperative-Effort-Stuart-Pilkington-Graduates-from-Fan-Sites-to-Collaborative-Photo-Projects-12950.shtml">See “Cooperative Efforts."</a>) “Originally, I started them as a way to get out to take my own pictures,” he recalls. Pilkington says he had dabbled in photography for years as an amateur. “I was just obsessed with documenting my life, I wasn’t concerned with how my pictures looked.” In his late 20s, however, he bought a Minox 35mm and a computer. “That’s when I became interested in how photos look,” he says. He began training his eye by reading about photography, watching interviews with numerous photographers, and trying to learn more about how photographers think about the creative process.  
<p>A voracious consumer of articles, books and interviews with photographers, Pilkington can’t remember how he first encountered the photographers who have had the greatest influence on his work: William Eggleston, Todd Hido, Stephen Shore and Joel Sternfeld. He says there’s a quality of “mindfulness” that he responded to in their work. “That’s something Stephen Shore and Joel Sternfeld talk about a lot. As I do more and more photography myself, I see that you become more hyper aware of your surroundings,” he says, and the banal or familiar takes on new interest. When you’re shooting regularly, he says, the world around you “becomes a treasure trove.”</p>
<p>He recalls an interview in which Sternfeld described driving around the U.S., shooting on a large-format camera; he could only afford to shoot one image a day. “Being on the road, he got into a meditative mindset, and things would present themselves.” When, for example, he sees Sternfeld’s 1982 image, “Exhausted Renegade Elephant, Woodland, Washington, June 1979,” of a roadside scene the photographer encountered on a day’s drive, Pilkington says, “I think he must have come across this, and then spent a half an hour getting the camera in the right spot.”</p>
<p>He also admires an image from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stephen-Shore-Uncommon-Places-Complete/dp/1931788340">Shore’s book</a> <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stephen-Shore-Uncommon-Places-Complete/dp/1931788340">Uncommon Places</a></em>, “Room 125, Westbank Motel, Idaho Falls, Idaho, July 18, 1973.” The view of an ordinary scene—the photographer’s bare feet on an ordinary motel bed—is transformed through the power of observation. “The composition is perfect, I think,” Pilkington says. “It’s got this Caravaggio light and it’s so crystal-clear, you’re transported to 1973.”</p>
<p>Its ability to bridge time and individual experience is what gives photography its power, Pilkington believes. “With photography you’re communicating directly with someone’s emotions without using words.” </p>]]></article_text>

<p><strong><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/SONY-X100V_2_GEAR.jpg" style="float: left;" />Sony FDR-X100V and HDR-AS200V</strong></p>
<p>Not content to let GoPro hog the 4K limelight, Sony has added 4K (3840x2160p) capture to its new flagship action camera, the <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1109328-REG/sony_fdr_x1000v_4k_action_cam.html/BI/1282/KBID/1657/kw/SOFDRX1000V/DFF/d10-v2-t1-xSOFDRX1000V">FDR-X100V</a>. Several advanced functions from Sony’s A7 camera line have also trickled down to the <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1109329-REG/sony_hdr_as200v_r_as200v_4k_action_cam.html/BI/1282/KBID/1657/kw/SOHDRAS200VR/DFF/d10-v2-t1-xSOHDRAS200VR">X100V</a>, including full pixel readout during recording, which reduces jagged edges and false colors by pulling all of the data off the CMOS sensor. When shooting in 4K at 30 fps, you’ll enjoy bit rates of 100Mbps; it drops to 60Mbps when shooting at 24 fps. The X100V can record in 1920x1080p at up to 120 fps or at 240 fps when shooting at 1280x720p resolution. The optical image stabilization system has been revamped from earlier action cams with a specific emphasis on stabilizing the camera for use on drones where low amplitude vibrations can induce nauseating jitters. Sony has added wind reduction to the stereo microphone as well as automatic exposure control and white balance settings to give pro users more latitude when adjusting exposure. </p>
<p>Another new addition to Sony’s 2015 action cam line is the Loop Recording feature. First, you designate a recording time interval; When the camera hits the end of the allotted time, it will automatically loop back to the beginning and start over-writing previously recorded footage with new video. You can set loop recording at 5, 20, 60, or 120-minute intervals—set it to unlimited, and it will use the entire capacity of your memory card. For those in search of a quick, shareable highlight reel from the day’s adventure, a new Highlight Movie Maker function uses algorithms pegged to the cameras gyro sensor to flag content recorded when the camera was moving or turning rapidly and compiles the clips automatically into a short movie. The X100V will be slightly larger than Sony’s existing action cams, so it won’t be compatible with older waterproof cases. If you don’t need the 4K experience, Sony’s new full HD HDR-AS200V updates the AS100V with Loop Record, Highlight Movie Maker, the full pixel readout functionality and a wind-reduction microphone. </p>

<p>Kodak—otherwise known as JK Imaging—has a relatively novel take on the action camera. Its SP360 not only takes the requisite pounding, but can also record 360-degree 1920x1080p HD video and 10-MP stills. In fact, the SP360 can produce several unique photo formats including a ring, a dome, a globe, a 360-degree panorama or a pair of 180-degree panoramas. Beyond its all-seeing 0.8mm (8.25mm full-frame equivalent) f/2.8 lens, the SP360 features 10-fps burst shooting at full resolution, and an on-board motion sensor for motion-activated recordings. Footage is saved to a microSD card; the SP360 accepts cards up to 32GB in capacity. With Wi-Fi and NFC, you can pair with mobile devices up to 65 feet away. The SP360 is water-resistant, shockproofed from falls as high as six feet and can endure temperatures as low as 14 degrees Fahrenheit. Kodak is selling the SP360 in three configurations; <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1086568-REG/kodak_sp360_yl3_sp360_action_camera_16mp_1080p.html">an Explorer version</a> that includes the camera, a standard housing, a vented helmet strap and a bar mount; <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1086569-REG/kodak_sp360_yl4_sp360_action_camera_16mp.html">an Aqua kit</a> with a waterproof housing, head strap and surfboard adhesive mount; and <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1086570-REG/kodak_sp360_yl5_sp360_action_camera_16mp_with.html/BI/1282/KBID/1657/kw/KOSP360YL5/DFF/d10-v2-t1-xKOSP360YL5">an Extreme kit</a> that includes the waterproof housing, suction cup mount, bar mount and head strap. </p>

<p><strong><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/contour_3QRTR_2_GEAR.jpg" style="float: left;" />Contour Roam3</strong></p>
<p>Contour, an early action cam pioneer, has rebounded from what looked like a fatal shut down of its business in 2013 with a renewed bid to grab back market share. The first product from the revitalized company is the <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1083889-REG/contour_1901_the_roam_3_americas.html/BI/1282/KBID/1657/kw/COTR3A/DFF/d10-v2-t1-xCOTR3A">Roam3</a>, and it’s aiming its tubular lens at newer entrants to action cam videography. The Roam3 records 1920x1080p video at 30 fps or 1280x720p at 60 fps, with a recording switch that locks into place so you don’t accidentally start or stop recording as you’re wrestling with a bear or whizzing down the trail. You can switch from video to photo mode by holding down the shutter. Contour’s free software utility lets you make additional changes to camera settings. A time-lapse function triggers 5-MP still photos at pre-determined intervals (1, 3, 5, 10, 30 or 60 seconds). The Roam3’s lens rotates 270 degrees—180 degrees to the left and 90 degrees to the right—and incorporates a laser level so your footage is properly oriented. It offers a wide, 170-degree field-of-view and is waterproof down to 30 feet without a case. The Roam3 has an internal rechargeable battery rated for up to 3.5 hours of recording, and ships with an 8GB microSD card. </p>

<p>Drift Innovations put its original Stealth action cam on a strict diet, producing <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1074097-REG/drift_10_006_00_stealth_2.html/BI/1282/KBID/1657/kw/DR1000600/DFF/d10-v2-t1-xDR1000600">the new Stealth 2</a>, which is 40-percent lighter and half the size of the original camera. Capable of recording 1920x1080p video at 30 fps or 1280x720p at 60 fps via its 3-MP image sensor, the Stealth 2 has a 135-degree wide-angle lens that can rotate a total of 300 degrees to achieve level footage no matter the angle it’s mounted at. It has built-in Wi-Fi for remote viewing and remote control via mobile device. There’s also a 1.3-inch LED display to tip you off to camera settings. Its internal battery is rated for three hours of continuous 1080p recording. In photo mode, the Stealth 2 can snap 12-MP interpolated stills or 2-MP images simultaneously when recording video. There’s also a time-lapse mode that will record 3-MP still images at intervals between one second up to one minute and a continuous shooting mode that clocks in at 3 fps for up to five seconds at a resolution of 5 MP. The Stealth 2 is weather-resistant, but not waterproof. There’s 2GB of internal memory and a microSD slot that supports cards up to 32GB. </p>

<p>While you won’t necessarily use <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1077245-REG/polaroid_polc3bk_cube_camera_black.html/BI/1282/KBID/1657/kw/POLC3BK/DFF/d10-v2-t1-xPOLC3BK">the Cube</a> to compose a cinematic masterpiece, this playful action cam is small enough (and cheap enough) to mount unobtrusively in any nook or cranny. In fact, it has a built-in magnet, so you can easily mount it to a metallic surface without clamps or other accessories—though Polaroid will naturally sell you those as well. The Cube is operated via a single button on the top, while additional camera settings, like video resolution, are adjustable behind the battery door. A tiny LED atop the camera will flash colors and blink in varying combinations to alert you to camera status. The f/2.0 lens offers a 124-degree angle of view. You can record 1920x1080p or 1280x720p HD video and 6-MP still images to microSD cards. A “cycle” record function lets you record to the capacity of a memory card then automatically start at the beginning of the card, erasing older footage. The internal battery is good for up to 90 minutes of 720p video recording before needing a recharge. The Cube is weatherproofed, but you’ll need an accessory case for any serious water-based action. </p>

<p><strong>GoPro Hero4 Black and Silver Editions<img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/GoProHero4_2_GEAR.jpg" style="float: right;" /></strong></p>
<p>Already accustomed to rocketing at high speeds, GoPro has now refreshed its Hero lineup to make it faster than ever. The flagship <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1078001-REG/gopro_chdhx_401_hero4_black_edition_adventure.html/BI/1282/KBID/1657/kw/GOH4AB/DFF/d10-v2-t1-xGOH4AB">Hero4 Black Edition</a> can now record 4K video (3840x2160p) at 30 fps, 2.7K footage at 50 fps and 1920x1080p video at up to 120 fps. The 12-megapixel Hero4 Black also features full-resolution still-photo bursts at 30 fps with faster Wi-Fi and improved audio processing that GoPro claims offers twice the dynamic range of its Hero3 predecessor. A new HiLight Tag feature lets you earmark key moments in your video while you’re recording, either through the GoPro app or a dedicated button on the camera. These highlights can then be quickly located in GoPro’s Studio software for sharing on social media or using in your highlight reel.</p>
<p>The new <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1078007-REG/gopro_chdhy_401_hero4_silver_edition_adventure.html/BI/1282/KBID/1657/kw/GOH4AS/DFF/d10-v2-t1-xGOH4AS">Silver edition Hero4</a> records 4K as well, but at a slower 15 or 12.5 fps. It has slower HD frame rates as well, topping out at 60 fps. The Silver Hero4 incorporates a touch-screen display—a first for the GoPro line—and also features HiLight Tag. Like the Black edition, the Silver Hero4 is capable of 30 fps still photo bursts at 12-MP resolution. Both cameras will ship with an accessory housing for diving up to 131 feet underwater.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[It’s difficult to look at <a href="http://www.jimmangan.com/home/photography/blast/">“BLAST,”</a> <a href="http://www.jimmangan.com/">Jim Mangan’s</a> new series of photographs, without imagining the noise. Mangan and his friend, rally-car driver Ken Block, collaborated on the project—Block tearing around the desert in his off-road racecar, kicking up dirt, and Mangan hovering overhead in a helicopter, making color and black-and-white 35mm film photographs of the temporary shapes and patterns Block created.
<p>The stretch of the Utah desert where Mangan made the photographs—which were published as <a href="http://www.dashwoodbooks.com/pages/books/14527/jim-mangan/blast">a book by Dashwood</a> and exhibited in January at <a href="http://205-a.com/post/102884128337/blast-by-jim-mangan-this-work-by">205A gallery in New York</a>—sits between Capitol Reef National Park and Goblin Valley State Park. The area is mostly empty but for a few country roads and trails. It’s so remote, in fact, that a non-profit group advocating the colonization of Mars has a research facility in the area. In other words, it’s probably incredibly quiet.</p>
<p>There’s something delightful and weird in thinking about that quiet, and about the noise Mangan and Block made for three days while creating “BLAST”: the <em>whop-whop </em>of the helicopter blades and the high-pitched roar of the rally car’s engine revving at maximum RPM as Block twisted figure eights and spun sweeping arcs across steep, rock-topped hills.</p>
<p>Mangan and Block met in Park City, Utah (where they both live), and connected through snowboarding. Block is well-known in motorsports circles, and by the wider public for his viral series of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qanlirrRWs">“Gymkhana” videos</a>, in which he tears around the closed streets of major cities like San Francisco, London and, most recently, Los Angeles. The gymkhana motorsports discipline, on which the video series is based, tests the speed and intricate maneuvering skill of drivers. But Mangan says his friendship with Block—their “human connection”—was just as important to his interest in the project as “what I imagined he would be able to do with his car.”</p>
<p>While creating the photographs, which Mangan shot using Leica R8 and R4 cameras, Mangan, Block and his race team communicated via radio headsets. While they planned some shots, “sometimes Ken would improvise and completely surprise us,” Mangan told <em>PDN</em> via email. “What he was able to do with his car was beyond my comprehension.”</p>
<p>The landscape in which Mangan and Block worked is “otherworldly,” Mangan notes, surrounded by dramatic rock formations that stand in earthy, colorful contrast to the blue desert skies. In one photograph we see Block arcing across the top of a long, thin rock slope that resembles the spine of a dragon. The formation casts a huge, black shadow as large rocks loom in the background. In other, more abstract images, the colors formed by the dust, sunlight, landscape and tire tracks weave beautiful patterns in the frame. </p>
<p>“The [initial] idea was to put the landscape in motion and present the images in an abstract way,” Mangan says. As they began work on the project, however, he elected to include the car in many of the images. The car photographs “provide a sense of scale and context” for the abstract images, Mangan explains. “I also like the how the artwork on the car looks really weird within the landscape.” In one photograph that takes a closer view, the colorful, Zebra-striped car leaves a trail of brown and white dust across a landscape of deep red, pale blue and chalky white. As Mangan edited, he focused on “the patterns of the dust trails…and how they interacted and come across visually in the landscape,” he says. Some of the images were shot at ground level as well, adding further context and variety to the series.</p>
<p>The car images also add a sense of fun bordering on recklessness that “BLAST” might not have were it composed completely of abstract images, and in that sense it’s true to Mangan’s experience. Once he realized the concept was bearing fruit, “it immediately became more fun and made me feel more confident,” he says. Block and his team also felt that “what was happening out there was something very unique and special for all of us and the vibe was no doubt infectious,” Mangan ads. “I hope that comes through in the images, and that goes back to having a connection with one another, which really helps make something successful.”</p>
<p>Motorized vehicles are permitted in the area, so Block and Mangan weren’t tearing up an otherwise pristine landscape. There is an element of disruption in the project, however, and Mangan acknowledges the work makes “some form” of reference to how humans interact with the natural world. But we imagine the dust clouds settled, the wind eventually erased the tire tracks, and, in all likelihood, the brush will recover from the abuse—Mangan’s photographs the only evidence of the brief, noisy, ecstatic intervention.</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[When photographers <a href="http://www.edpanar.com/">Ed Panar</a> and <a href="http://melissacatanese.com/">Melissa Catanese</a> moved to Pittsburgh in 2011 with a plan to open <a href="http://www.spacescorners.com/">Spaces Corners</a>, a photo bookshop, they also had in mind a “laundry list” of projects they wanted to work on, Panar says. One of the projects about which they were most enthusiastic involved inviting people throughout the community to share personal images, to create a visual archive of the city. They felt the project was “bigger than we were able to take care of on our own,” however, so it was tabled. Then in 2014, the <a href="http://www.nowseethis.org/">Hillman Photography Initiative</a>, an “incubator for innovative thinking on the photographic image” initiated by the <a href="http://www.cmoa.org/">Carnegie Museum of Art</a>, began seeking project proposals. Panar and Catanese pitched <a href="http://www.nowseethis.org/peopleshistory">A People’s History of Pittsburgh</a>, as they’ve dubbed the project, and secured the museum’s support.
<p>Since then, they’ve invited photo submissions through a dedicated website for the project; have held scanning days at the museum so members of the community can digitize prints of family images; and have actively sought both private and institutional archives in an effort to cast a wide net and represent as much of the community as possible. In addition to the Web-based image archive—which is searchable by date and location—Panar and Catanese are working on a book to be released this spring.</p>
<p>Curiosity was one of their biggest motivations. Panar and Catanese were “interested in looking at these kinds of photos,” Panar explains. “As photographers interested in place, it’s been absolutely fascinating to see what types of photographs people are willing to share with us and the public.” At one scanning day, Panar recalls, “we had a woman who brought in an album that went back over 100 years. Her entire family had been living in the same home over several generations; she had photographs of several generations of her family standing in front of this home.” </p>
<p>Panar says their efforts to find specific collections held by individuals and institutions, like that of a local bank that covers an entire century, have also been important to the project. “We didn’t want to leave the submissions open only to those who have online access and/or know about the project through traditional [media] channels.”</p>
<p>Making the archive as inclusive as possible has been “one of the biggest challenges,” Panar says. They’ve promoted the project through the media, and have hosted scanning events in different parts of the city, but still would like to reach more people. Early this year, they were working to identify underrepresented “groups of people, time periods and parts of town” and were making specific inquiries to fill those gaps.</p>
<p>As they begin to edit the images into initial drafts of the publication, they will be looking through more than 1,500 images from more than a thousand sources. “Our primary criteria will be to select as many different types of images as possible, depicting as many time periods, views, activities and events, from as many different age groups and backgrounds as possible,” Panar explains.</p>
<p>The pair knows that creating a definitive archive is, by both practical and theoretical standards, impossible, but that impossibility is a part of the experience. “It’s always a challenge to try to achieve what’s ultimately impossible—a comprehensive photographic collection that could adequately represent the story of a few hundred thousand people” Panar explains. Their archive will be “a history, not <em>the</em> history.” Still, they hope that viewers will find something relatable in the publication, which they are fashioning as a poetic “stream of consciousness of images that will hopefully evoke the complexity and difficulty of depicting a common history and memory” and will inspire viewers to imagine “some of the stories from countless individuals whose lives and families helped shape and were shaped by this region.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[In 2010, Chris Isenberg, Kimou Meyer and Aaron Amaro, three friends and colleagues with a variety of business experience, founded the creative studio <a href="http://doubledayandcartwright.com/">Doubleday &amp; Cartwright</a>. They started by providing creative services to sports-oriented clients such as Nike, ESPN and Red Bull, as well as <a href="http://nomas-nyc.com/">No Mas</a>, a clothing company owned by Isenberg. But Doubleday &amp; Cartwright has expanded in its four-year history: It now has offices in Brooklyn, New York and Venice Beach, California, and has produced a variety of marketing and creative work for Converse, Carhartt, Jordan Brand, Nissan, American Eagle Outfitters, GE and other clients. The studio has also been tapped to collaborate with other agencies, including Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, AKQA and Wieden &amp; Kennedy, and launched a biannual, 11 x 17-inch newsprint publication on sports and culture called <em><a href="http://victoryjournal.com/">Victory Journal</a></em> that publishes images big. The publication has few ads, but a high cover price. The goal, according to co-founder Isenberg, is to produce a “high cost, low volume” product that is also beautiful. 
<p>Co-founder and creative director Aaron Amaro tells <em>PDN </em>about how <em>Victory Journal</em> assigns and designs its photo-heavy stories for both the print publication and <a href="http://victoryjournal.com/">victoryjournal.com</a>. A graduate of Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, Amaro worked as a designer and art director at studios and agencies including The Valentine Group, Wolff Ollins, Euro RSCG and Ogilvy &amp; Mather before he co-founded Doubleday &amp; Cartwright and <em>Victory Journal</em>. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What’s different about the way <em>Victory Journal</em> covers sports?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AA:</strong> It’s more experience-based than statistics-based. There aren’t a lot of people doing this in the sports category: People who see sports as more than statistics and betting and the Super Bowl.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How did <em>Victory Journal</em> start?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AA: </strong>It’s something [co-founder] Chris Isenberg always wanted to do. We’ve been working together for about seven years. We started a creative agency, Doubleday &amp; Cartwright, built around sports, in 2010, and we gradually built it into a larger multi-disciplinary studio [offering] creative services for clients. That’s how we’ve funded <em>Victory Journal</em>. </p>
<p>It’s a perfect marriage of our interests. Chris was an aficionado of sports and I came from the love of old communication, old graphic design, new graphic design, printing and photography. It’s all bootstrapped. For the first issue, which came out around the 2010 World Cup, I think we printed about 2,000 copies. We had wanted to do a free magazine, but we couldn’t, then we tried to do it as a newsprint magazine for $5, but it seemed ironic printing beautiful photos on low-quality newsprint. We upped the production, made it $16 an issue, and we print 8,000–12,000 copies. It’s like an art journal, at least in the printing, and with cinematic photography. We try to produce <em>Victory Journal</em> beautifully, and in turn support it with subscriptions. The people who like us love us religiously, but it’s a small, core group of religious followers.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Do you pay for the photography you use?</strong></p>
<p>AA: Yes. We pay photographers. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What role does photography play in the mission of <em>Victory Journal</em>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AA:</strong> Photography is huge for <em>Victory Journal</em>. It’s a platform for experiencing images larger. I oversee the color printing. Printing is becoming a fading art, and fewer people do it well. We go through the color reproduction of each issue, and in each issue it gets a little better. We credit our retoucher, <a href="http://www.shaneleelyons.com/">Shane Lee Lyons</a>, on the masthead because he is so important to helping us do what we do. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you find and assign the photographers who shoot stories in <em>Victory Journal</em>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AA:</strong> About 25 percent come in as submissions. Photographers will reach out to us through our website, or contact me or the editors, Chris Isenberg and Piotr Orlov. Sometimes we’ll ask to see the extended edit to see if there’s something else. Though it might take weeks, we try to respond to everyone’s submissions. </p>
<p>Another type of story we’ll do is to show a collection of someone’s work, like <a href="http://www.cheryldunn.net/">Cheryl Dunn’s</a> work from the 1980s on boxing. Those will often run with a long interview [with the photographer]. Chris [Isenberg] knows Jerome Liebling’s daughter and we featured the amazing story he shot about Russian men in Miami in the 1970s playing handball. </p>
<p>We also have stories that we’re passionate about, that we assign because we don’t want to miss out. We usually assign a story producer to [a story] to work out logistics, and then we hire from a circle of photographers who are available. For example, Chris [Isenberg] had a chance to cover a football match between two long-time rivals [Liverpool and Everton]. The Premier League took a long time to get us credentials but at the last minute we got the green light. We pulled in <a href="http://nilsericson.com/">Nils Ericson</a>, whom we’ve worked with before. He happened to be in Paris assisting someone else and took a quick trip to England to be with Chris, and ended up getting the cover of the issue, which is cool. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: So you do cover ordinary sporting events, though you publish twice a year? </strong></p>
<p><strong>AA:</strong> One of the things we’re doing is shooting an event differently. I’ve done a lot of work with photographer <a href="http://anthonyblasko.com/">Anthony Blasko</a>, who has shot for <em>Victory Journal </em>and for Nike. We went to Art Center College of Design together, we’re friends, and he was one of the first shooters for us. He’d never shot sports before he started shooting for <em>Victory Journal</em>. He and I have built an emotional, cinematic approach to following the key characters, deconstructing each event, and distilling what matters in the story. It’s almost like making a short film. </p>
<p>We got courtside seats for the Ultimate Fighting Championship between Jon Jones and Alexander Gustafsson, and Anthony Blasko and I went. He captured an amazing series. It was very bloody, but I thought it was also really beautiful. </p>
<p>Alessandro Sometti photographed a lamb wrestling match in Senegal, and we had a writer in Senegal write an essay about the sport. I’ve also worked a lot with Chadwick Tyler, who shot for Nike and the first issue of <em>Victory Journal</em>. He’s really more of a fashion and art photographer. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you match photographers with stories?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AA:</strong> Everyone in the studio participates. We have a sort of leadership crew: myself, Chris Isenberg, and Piotr Orlov. We three usually go through story ideas. I might get a great mailer, or a photographer will reach out to us through our website or on email. At those meetings, one of us will champion an idea and make the case for why it’s a great story, then the others will look further at it and we’ll decide if it should go in print or online, depending on the theme of the issue. </p>
<p>Some of the themes have included <a href="http://victoryjournal.com/stories/the-greatest-of-all-time">“The Greatest,”</a> where we featured Thomas Hoepker’s work on Muhammed Ali. Another theme was “Water,” another was “For Love or Money,” another was “Blood and Asphalt.” As we work on an issue we’ll probably have 150–160 pages of content, and that gets edited down to 116. Some stories might fall a bit outside the theme, so we’ll try to share them with the world on the website, which gets a bit more traffic. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How is designing or planning the print issue different from designing or planning the online edition?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AA:</strong> The print publication is an object, and we try to design it to be a beautiful object. </p>
<p>I get a little scrutiny in the office: Why don’t you shake up the design sometimes? I like to see big images with captions. I like a grid, and I like all the ads in the back. That’s the foundation we print on. </p>
<p>In print, 12–16 pages is the maximum we have to capture a giant, beautiful story, and that’s hard because some of the stories could be books unto themselves. </p>
<p>Some of these photographic stories we try to develop into long-form stories online, but we don’t have the budget every month to do the development [required]. </p>
<p>Online is a challenging animal. Most of the ad industry is about impressions, even in niche media. </p>
<p>My philosophy about audience acquisition is: If you build it, they will come. But you’re entering a contract with the audience, and you have to be dependable. It’s about consistency: That’s what we’re trying for. </p>
<p>We can do <em>Victory Journal</em> twice a year in print and it works. With digital, we try to do four pieces a month. I know that daily updates is where it’s at if you want traffic, but that’s hard for us. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: You’re the creative director for Doubleday &amp; Cartwright, and also oversee the art direction for <em>Victory Journal</em>. How do you juggle your priorities?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AA:</strong> The days are just really full.</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Englishman <a href="http://www.stuartpilkington.co.uk/">Stuart Pilkington</a> describes himself as “a jack of all trades, master of none.” But in 2008, when Pilkington launched his first online group photography project, he discovered a latent talent. “I like getting people together, seeing what will happen,” he says. “I think we all like to be part of a tribe.” 
<p>Before that, Pilkington had bounced around in different jobs—from television postproduction to financial brokerage—and although he had a passion for photography, he didn’t know what to do with it. “I wasn’t confident enough to shoot much. I’d just ask photographers what equipment they liked, then go out and buy it.” In 2007, like many others, he opened a Facebook account but, rather than posting status updates, decided to use it to connect with like-minded people. Previously, he’d created <a href="http://www.stuartpilkington.co.uk/paulauster/body.htm">a fan website for the author Paul Auster</a>, who’d noticed the site and invited Pilkington to meet him in New York. So he decided to set up fan pages on Facebook for his photo heroes, Alec Soth and William Eggleston.</p>
<p>When photographers flocked to the Soth and Eggleston pages, it occurred to Pilkington that he was sitting on top of a pool of creativity. He conceived an ambitious idea: He would produce an online exhibition, <a href="http://www.alphabetproject.co.uk/">The Alphabet Project</a>, with one photographer for each letter of the alphabet. Photographer A would set an assignment for the other twenty-five; then two weeks later, photographer B would set a new assignment. And so on, for a year. </p>
<p>At first, when no one responded, the project seemed doomed. But after a few weeks, a photographer wrote back saying she liked the idea. “Sometimes, all it takes is one catalyst,” Pilkington says. Still, once the 26 were assembled, he didn’t know if they’d follow through. “I kept sending emails: I must have driven everyone mad. Luckily it was a great group of people: Everyone did it. Otherwise, it could have been the death of me.” </p>
<p>Orchestrating The Alphabet Project, and bringing it to completion as <a href="http://www.alphabetproject.co.uk/">a Web-based album</a> showed Pilkington he had a gift for producing large projects. Since then, he has put together eight more group projects, from 2009’s <a href="http://www.50statesproject.net/">The Fifty States Project</a> (a photographer in every state, each responding to assignments such as “Industry” and “Entertainment”) to <a href="http://www.theswap.info/">The Swap</a>, an ongoing initiative where two photographers meet and take portraits of each other. In addition to The Swap, he is currently overseeing <a href="http://www.threedisciplines.co.uk/">The Three Disciplines</a>, a project where photographers tackle three new genres: for example, an architecture photographer takes on self-portrait, still life and street photography. As with his other projects, The Three Disciplines has its own, <a href="http://www.threedisciplines.co.uk/">ongoing website</a>.</p>
<p>Since The Fifty States Project, his third endeavor, Pilkington’s reputation has grown. Thanks to a stellar list of contributors, The Fifty States Project garnered hundreds of thousands of hits and was featured in <em>Esquire</em> magazine. Now, with The Swap, he envisages a book project: “Not to make money, because you can’t do that with a book, but just because a book is a lovely, tactile thing.”</p>
<p>For his photographer collaborators, being part of Pilkington’s projects can build community and confidence. “It’s broadened my visibility and connections,” says <a href="http://www.sandydyas.com/">Sandra L. Dyas</a>, who represented Iowa in The Fifty States Project and has contributed to The Swap. London-based <a href="http://www.lenkaraynh.com/">Lenka Rayn H.</a>, who also contributed to The Swap, agrees. “I’m proud of the work and will be exhibiting it in future. It has also been interesting seeing other swaps.”</p>
<p>These days, Pilkington has a spreadsheet of several thousand photographers he’s worked with, all of whom are invited to take part in upcoming projects. He also scours the Web for new talent, looking at sites like Conscientious, FlakPhoto and <em>PDN’s</em> 30. He has approached famous photographers, some of whom might contribute in the future. </p>
<p>But perhaps best of all, he has started shooting a project for himself. “Strangers in Paradise” documents people he meets on walks around cities in Britain’s northwest, and has itself become part of an online multi-photographer project, Documenting Britain. “Doing these group projects puts me in touch with so many photographers, it’s like my own university,” he says—a feeling that is echoed by many photographers he’s drawn into his projects. “Stuart’s projects inspire and motivate me: it’s fun to share my work online and be part of something,” says Dyas. “Participating in them makes my world much bigger than it was.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.lindleywarren.com/">Lindley Warren</a> was a 19-year-old photography student when she started her first online collaborative project. Mostly, it was a reaction to not liking her college classes. “I didn’t like studying studio lighting and digital cameras,” she says. “I like film; I love looking at images. The collaborative project was something I could get excited about.” 
<p>That was in 2009, before many photographers were on Facebook and “their lives were apparent,” Warren says. Instead, she would look at photographers’ websites and wonder about their personal lives. “I wanted to see what mattered to these people,” she says. “I also liked the idea of having people who weren’t portrait photographers send photos of people in their lives.”</p>
<p>She began contacting photographers—at first, choosing peers she felt comfortable approaching—and inviting them to submit photographs of people they “love, cherish, and find inspiration within.” Everyone was enthusiastic. The website for <a href="http://www.theoneswelove.net/">The Ones We Love</a> was so successful, in fact, that when Warren left art school after a semester and traveled to the Netherlands, she decided to launch another collaborative project, <a href="http://thephotographicdictionary.net/">The Photographic Dictionary</a>. </p>
<p>On <a href="http://thephotographicdictionary.net/">thephotographicdictionary.net</a>, photographers interpret a word of their choice or apply a word to an existing photograph. Unlike the more serious tone of The Ones We Love, The Photographic Dictionary allows for playfulness. Interpretations have ranged from the literal (a pooch in a car for “dog”), to the poetic (“knit” shows a couple’s legs intertwined) to the out-and-out absurd—for example, the word “absurd” (a man with nine frankfurters hanging out of his mouth). Words and images don’t always correspond directly, which Warren loves: “I think it makes it more interesting if the connection is the photographer’s secret.” </p>
<p>As with The Ones We Love, The Photographic Dictionary has an open submission policy, but is curated by Warren to ensure cohesiveness. In addition to taking submissions, Warren reaches out to photographers she admires. “I love finding someone’s work, being impacted by it, and sending an email,” she says. “If the person responds, it creates an exciting working relationship, which keeps it fresh for me.” </p>
<p>Photographer <a href="http://joshandersonphotography.com/">Josh Anderson</a>, who has contributed several images to The Photographic Dictionary, came across the project on <a href="http://thephotographicdictionary.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> in March of 2014 and was immediately impressed. “It seemed like a fun and clever thing…I liked that it required not just a good image but a good word,” he says. Though slightly intimidated (a lot of photographers who were contributing were people he admired), he sent images to Warren, who not only accepted them, but looked at <a href="http://joshandersonphotography.tumblr.com/">his Tumblr</a> and suggested he put words to other images. </p>
<p>Words Anderson has tackled include “clamor,” “pattern” and “estrange.” “Having to marry two very interpretive things is initially overwhelming, but ultimately exciting…it made me think more about my own work, and ways to make it smarter,” he says. Since taking part in the project, he’s received positive feedback and made new connections. “You see work by these people who are essentially your peers; you might email with them or even meet them, but when you get to be part of a project with them, it’s great. Overall it’s increased the number of people I might reach out to about ideas or collaborations.”</p>
<p>For Warren, the projects have been beneficial, too. She has self-published and sold collections of images from both projects, and has curated exhibitions in locations ranging from Des Moines, Iowa, to Vienna, Austria. She is planning more printed publications, and is tickled that several English teachers have asked permission to use The Photographic Dictionary to teach vocabulary. “Taking my own images only gets me so far,” she says. “On the other hand, working with people and sequencing their images feeds me. Creating this side world where different photographers are together in the same space—that’s just very exciting.” </p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[What if someone asked photographers to document disappearing glaciers in an artful way? And what if that person set up meetings with scientists to ensure the photographs would be scientifically useful? And what if the public were allowed to contribute their own glacier photos through an open-source digital platform?
<p>These are questions photographer <a href="http://www.klausthymann.com/">Klaus Thymann</a> began asking himself in 2008. Though he was not an environmental activist at that point, Thymann says that as a Dane, he’d been exposed to environmental news and that “climate change had been on my radar for some time.” A photographer who has shot fine art as well as commercial assignments for such clients as Adidas and Johnnie Walker, Thymann had previously done an ambitious global project, <a href="http://www.klausthymann.com/projects/9/hybrids-selected-works.html">“Hybrids,”</a> in which he mapped and photographed hybrid cultures such as gay rodeo in Los Angeles and underwater striptease in Chile. “I have a fascination with mapping, but after “Hybrids” I told myself, ‘I’ll never do anything that complicated again,’” he says with a laugh. </p>
<p>Famous last words. While conceiving the glacier project, it seemed only appropriate to Thymann to include multiple photographers. “I was aware that if this was a one-photographer project, it would play on heroic stereotypes of man against mountain, and devalue the message,” he says. Likewise, having collaborators in the science world seemed important, to give the project heft and integrity. </p>
<p>Accordingly, one of Thymann’s first moves was to meet with scientists at the <a href="http://www.wgms.ch/">World Glacier Monitoring Service</a>, which collects statistics on glacier change. He also recruited several co-directors, including London-based photography agent <a href="http://wyattclarkejones.com/">John Wyatt-Clarke</a> (who initially trained as a geologist), and veteran NGO director Marjorie Thompson. Naming the project? Easy. Since climate change is “the most pressing issue we’re facing,” Thymann says, it would be <a href="http://www.project-pressure.org/">Project Pressure</a>.</p>
<p>With his administrative team in place, Thymann began looking for photographers. Though Project Pressure is a documentary effort, he chose to work with fine-art photographers. “I have a lot of respect for documentary photographers, but I think people who work in artistic practice can conceptualize things more deeply,” he says. “That’s important, because we want to create work that can reach people on a deep level and inspire them to engage.” </p>
<p>As each photographer came on board, Project Pressure helped organize funding and equipment, usually provided by sponsors. For <a href="http://www.coreyfishes.com/">Corey Arnold’s</a> 2013 project in Svalbard, Norway, Project Pressure secured a grant from The Lighthouse Foundation. To pay to send <a href="http://peterfunch.com/">Peter Funch</a> to photograph Mount Baker in Washington State in 2014, Project Pressure mounted a successful Kickstarter campaign, and got <a href="http://www.polaroideyewear.com/?lang=en_US">Polaroid Eyewear</a> to donate what Thymann calls “a sizable amount.” </p>
<p>For Funch, a New York-based Danish conceptual photographer, participating in the project wasn’t an obvious move (“Me, photographing glaciers?” he thought at first), but excitement grew when he found archival images of Mount Baker to replicate, resulting in direct comparisons that show the glacier’s shrinkage. His striking photographs, composed of layers shot separately through red, green and blue filters, recall old postcards whose color combining has gone slightly awry. “This is a charity, but I feel it’s so much my own project too,” he says. Last December, <em>The New Yorker</em> featured a portfolio of his images, which was a boost for Funch and Project Pressure alike.</p>
<p>The work has been featured on the Project Pressure website, which is coded by Andrew Habermann, a programmer in Germany who has donated his time and skills to the project. In its next phase, Project Pressure will launch an open-source digital platform for members of the public to upload their own photographs of glaciers, shot on vacations, which will form a database of comparative imagery. A beta version is currently being tested. Thymann is hoping to roll the database out by the end of 2015, and says that, unlike the artist projects to date, it will be “more of a data-gathering platform.” He loves the fact that Project Pressure is growing, and taking on a life of its own. “It’s something I started, but it’s not my idea any more,” he says. “It’s a networked activity, and it feels good to relinquish control.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[The cover photo of indie rock band Magic Man’s most recent album, <em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/before-the-waves/id877785720">Before the Waves</a></em>, is a seascape at twilight, erupting with energy. Hundreds of colored light points dart around the edge of the water, mixed by the ebb and flow of the current, captured with a long exposure. Photographer <a href="http://www.tobiashutzler.com/">Tobias Hutzler</a> calls the technique, which he originally developed in his personal work, “light drawing.”
<p>“I’m interested in light and its interaction with the landscape. It’s not me that’s drawing. It’s nature,” he says, explaining that he photographs the manipulation of artificial light by wind, waves, and gravity. The long-exposures result in traces of light, both ordered and random, across dramatic landscapes. Hutzler creates the images in camera, without any post-production manipulation. “The images have a hand-written character. It’s like calligraphy. It has imperfection. That’s the beauty of it,” he says.</p>
<p>He began his “light drawing” project more than a year ago, taking trips into the deserts of the American west to study the nuances and ever-changing qualities of different types of light against the natural “canvases.” “I’m searching for some kind of abstraction of nature,” and the interaction between the light and landscape is always fluid in the desert, he says. Deserts also tend to be far from the light pollution of cities.</p>
<p>Hutzler can spend anywhere from several days to more than a week on each trip, figuring out how to photograph with twilight, moonlight, fire and artificial lights such as lasers, glow sticks, and other light sources. </p>
<p>“It looks different in the camera than in real life. That’s why I experiment—to figure out how it works. My lab is basically the desert, where I test it, then apply it to assignments,” he says. </p>
<p>Hutzler ended up showing his light drawing work to <a href="http://davebett.com/">Dave Bett</a>, whom he’d met at the Palm Springs Photo Festival. Bett, who is design director for Sony Music Entertainment’s Columbia Records division, was looking to hire a photographer to help promote the new Magic Man album. The cover of the band’s previous album had featured images of colored smoke in wooded landscapes. “We wanted to take that idea of an unusual phenomenon in a natural setting to another level. Tobias’s light paintings were the answer,” Bett says. “We wanted to create a surreal, unearthly event in a beautiful natural environment.”</p>
<p>The title of Magic Man’s new album suggested a seascape, and members of the band wanted a setting that reflected their origins in the northeast, he explains. Bett and Hutzler chose Block Island, off the coast of Rhode Island, for its unpopulated oceanfront, and because it was close to New York City, but far enough away so light pollution wasn’t a problem.</p>
<p>Hutzler’s assignment was to scout the island for places to shoot, and present light drawing ideas for the album packaging. “Tobias was free to draw from his experience making personal work, this [assignment] would basically be an extension of that for him creatively,” Bett says, while noting that the turnaround time was tight and the budget was “low.”</p>
<p>Hutzler’s idea was to make images that captured the sense of calm before a storm. He decided to “do something with fire” in a serene landscape where “you feel something is about to happen.” </p>
<p>Because fire is often a visual clich&eacute;, he was looking for unusual ways to shoot it. He turned to a science-minded friend, who suggested photographing an underwater fire. The idea worked. “It had a magic glow. It looked like a volcano,” Hutzler says, adding, “It’s more modern, more abstract” than a traditional photograph of a fire. (He used a chemical agent that burns underwater, though he declined to identify it.) </p>
<p>For another image, “we wanted to have an entire landscape burning,” he says. To simulate that, he used string to tie hundreds of small lights to a large net, and threw the net into the water, far enough from shore so wave action could move the lights freely in all directions. The resulting image, Hutzler says, “is basically an illustration of the waves, and the energy and movement of the water, through light.” (The resulting image was used on the album cover.)</p>
<p>The reason he attached the lights to a net, he explains, “is because I wanted to collect the lights [afterwards], not create garbage” in the ocean. Hutzler wouldn’t say what types of lights he used, hinting only that he’s experimented in the past with glow sticks and waterproof, battery-powered LED lights. </p>
<p>Hutzler had to work within the narrow windows of time just after sunset and before sunrise, when “there was just enough light to expose the seascape, and just enough dark for the streaks of light-painting to register,” says Bett, who was on set.</p>
<p>He continues, “We’d shoot starting before dusk until 10 or 11 p.m. or so, then sleep a few hours to start again before sunrise. Then we’d review what we shot and plan for the next window. After a few days of this we were exhausted.” The conditions were cold and wet, and they had to haul equipment to and from the beach in the dark, going up and down a muddy bluff. “This was probably the most physically demanding shoot I’d ever experienced, with very satisfying, beautiful results,” says Bett, who adds that Hutzler provided “dozens of images” for the campaign.</p>
<p>Hutzler has landed other assignments on the strength of his light-drawing project, most recently for a 20-page <em><a href="http://www.geo-international.de/">GEO</a> </em>feature about a paleontological expedition to the Canadian Rocky Mountains. The scientists on the expedition were searching for clues to the origins of life in the fossil record.</p>
<p>“The assignment was to interpret the magic of what the scientists were discovering, using my approach to light,” Hutzler says. He wanted to photograph the scientists’ camp at twilight, amid the soaring mountains, “to show how small humans are in this scope of nature.” Hutzler knew he had just a few minutes each day of “in-between light” just after sunset. After a week of constant rain and snow that kept him tent-bound, the weather finally cleared at just the right time, and for just long enough.</p>
<p>“I climbed half an hour up a hill, had one minute to shoot, then climbed back down,” he says. The long exposure “was like looking down on a little city, with people moving between tents with their flashlights.”</p>
<p>Hutzler says he does little to promote his personal work. Instead, he focuses on projects that are out of the ordinary. Several, including his light drawing project and a video he made of a circus performer building an elaborate balance, have gone viral. “It’s important to go on a path where nobody else goes, and to go beyond common projects,” he says. Not only does that strategy help define him as an artist, he says, but it attracts clients interested in hiring him to apply the esthetics and techniques of his personal work to the promotion of their brands.</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<em>As official photographer of the Iditarod since 1980, Jeff Schultz is following the race once again this week by air and snowmachine. The following is an excerpt from <a href="http://www.iditarodphotos.com/chasingdogs.html">his self-published book</a> </em>Chasing Dogs, <em>which documents the race and Schultz's adventures covering it for more than 30 years. &nbsp;</em> <br />
<br />
The Iditarod tests a person in so many ways. And it’s a rewarding test—I have learned this firsthand during more than 30 years as the official Iditarod photographer. Covering the event takes endurance, strategic thinking, tolerance for cold, patience, the ability to deal with mechanical, technical, or logistical problems, and make decisions on the fly. Oh, and it helps to have a strong back to pack a load of photography gear, among other necessities.<br />
<br />
Through all those years, I’ve also seen that anyone who joins in making the Iditarod happen—in any&nbsp; way—is guaranteed the adventure of a lifetime, whether it’s selling T-shirts in Anchorage, doing vet checks along the trail, shoveling dog poop at a checkpoint, or setting up tables for the finishers’ banquet in Nome. Working the Iditarod, volunteers can claim a special badge of honor, something akin to celebrity status.<br />
<br />
My job is volunteer work, too. The role was an opportunity that was simply handed to me in 1980 by the “Father of the Iditarod,” Joe Redington, Sr. I had no qualifications, no interview, no portfolio review, or test. It was purely a blessing.<br />
<br />
When I shot my first race in 1981, I had no idea what I was getting into or how the Iditarod would forever change my life. I was 21 years old and had been in Alaska for just two years. But this I did know: I was born for two things—adventure and photography. And for me, the Iditarod was, and still is, saturated with monumental opportunity for both.<br />
<br />
That first year I was constantly out of my comfort zone. No two days were the same, no two hours were the same. Where’s the best place to be right now? Who do I talk to? Is that a working snowmachine?&nbsp; There were photo opportunities in every direction, things I’d never seen before. And I loved it.<br />
<br />
Since the first running in 1973, the race has grown in popularity, and the state legislature voted to make dog-mushing Alaska’s official state sport. The race is followed by people all over the country and the world. In Alaska, more people know who won last year’s Iditarod than who won the Super Bowl.<br />
<br />
Who wins doesn’t matter to me. I don’t have favorites, but I do smile when new blood enters the winner’s circle. I simply enjoy chronicling what happens on the trail and I’m forever looking for the ultimate image—something that says "Iditarod" at first glance, whether it’s an Alaskan husky curled up on a bed of straw, a weary musher doing her dog chores, or a tiny team shot from the air, a mere dot on a vast, beautiful canvas.<br />
<br />
After more than 30 years of chasing dogs and their mushers on the Iditarod Trail, it seems I’ve become a race fixture. I cherish my time on the trail, reconnecting with friends and watching mushers contend with the trail and nature. And that’s what the Last Great Race does—ties people together and changes lives—for better and for worse.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I think I’ve seen most everything, and yet the trail continues to throw surprises at me. Each year I can’t wait to go back.]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[The term “B-roll” may carry a faintly derogatory air, like the “B-team” some of us were relegated to in high school sports. But that’s merely the rhetorical baggage of the film era. In fact, B-roll can be the visual engine driving your video narrative forward, or as filmmaker <a href="http://www.grant-slater.com/">Grant Slater</a> says, B-roll is what “keeps people from being bored” by talking heads.&nbsp;
<p>Since B-roll usually constitutes the most visually interesting and creative elements of any video project, it can be a challenge for camera operators and directors to decide just what to shoot, how to shoot it and how much footage they’ll ultimately need for a given project. But it’s also an opportunity to show off your creative chops, impress directors and make your mark on a project. We spoke with several filmmakers to learn their B-roll tips. (To view some of their video clips, see <a href="/exports/galleries/B-Roll-in-Action-A-Look-at-the-Videos-12947.shtml">"B-Roll in Action: A Look at the Videos."</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Prepping the B-roll Battlefield</strong></p>
<p>Approaches to B-roll are as varied as the films and video projects one can tackle. Some directors prefer to record B-roll themselves, while others will entrust the duty to second (or third camera) operators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those shooting their own B-roll—like <a href="http://www.alaskapublic.org/slavik-boyechko/">Slavik Boyechko</a> and his partner <a href="http://www.alaskapublic.org/travis-gilmour/">Travis Gilmour</a>—keeping a running shot list in their heads, if not formally on paper, ensures visual variety.</p>
<p>“The one question we ask whenever we’re doing a shoot is, ‘What’s a second or third location we can shoot, even if it’s just down the street,’” to mix things up, Boyechko says.</p>
<p>While you can’t anticipate everything on set, Slater says there are a few tactics he relies on when approaching B-roll duty. “I think a lot about matched action and sequences, where I’m shooting the same action from different angles to compress time or make something that would [otherwise] be boring take less time and be exciting,” Slater says. In concrete terms, it means “you’re creating a progressive series of wide, medium and tight shots that move a story forward,” he adds.</p>
<p>Sometimes moving subjects are hard to come by, and having a shot list or rough storyboard is all the more imperative. For <em><a href="http://www.grant-slater.com/the-whale-warehouse/">Whale Warehouse</a></em>, a short documentary Slater made in collaboration with <a href="http://www.maeryan.com/">Mae Ryan</a>, exploring the massive collection of skeletal remains privately housed by natural history museums, “Nothing moves, everything is dead and we had to figure out how to make it more exciting,” Slater recalls. “So we talked with a guy who runs the warehouse and got the facts we needed on day one. We came back later with a shot list based on the [interview] and went and recorded those clips very methodically.”</p>
<p>For photographer/directors like <a href="http://www.joshrothstein.com/">Josh Rothstein</a>—who will often shoot B-roll as a second camera—preparation isn’t the only skill to master. “Understanding your positioning on set is key, and that will inform your ability to get what you need,” Rothstein says. As someone who has been on both first and second units, Rothstein says that B-roll shooters need to read the “dynamics on set” to know when it’s permissible to move in on a subject and when to hang back.</p>
<p>For an assignment for Puma with the Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, Rothstein’s approach, much like an effective portrait photographer, was to get his subject as comfortable as possible. Your proximity to the subject is huge because “it will inform the quality of your footage,” he says. It’s a challenge, he adds, because you have to accommodate the sensibilities of both the subject and the director, while still being assertive enough to get your shot.</p>
<p><strong>How much is enough?</strong></p>
<p>There’s no golden ratio of how much B-roll you should generate for a given duration of A-roll footage, but there is a general consensus: You need more than you think.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You have to shoot, shoot, shoot and shoot—non-stop,” Rothstein says.</p>
<p>“We always feel like we never have enough,” Boyechko seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a collection of 60–90-second spots for United Healthcare, director <a href="http://jonathanchapman.com/">Jonathan Chapman</a> and his team would often record as much as 30 minutes of footage, giving editors plenty to work with. For the seven-and-a-half minute Whale Warehouse, Slater amassed a project folder stuffed with 800GB worth of video clips.</p>
<p>For the Web videos that Boyechko is producing, the clips themselves have to be between three and five seconds; he says that people’s attention spans have eroded to the point that anything longer than that loses the viewer’s interest. But thinking in terms of hundreds of seconds-long clips can be confusing, so instead Boyechko approaches B-roll filming as a series of clips-within-clips. His approach is akin to a vacuum, liberally sucking up as much visual material in a scene, and then relying on selecting favorites to create sub-clips from the longer video in Apple’s Final Cut Pro X.</p>
<p>“We don’t stop recording in between [scene] changes,” Boyechko says. “We’ll do a 10-minute recording, and that will contain about 50 clips. If I have a five-minute video [to produce] I’ll generate about 400 short clips to work with,” he says. He later culls those down to between 50–70 clips, each just seconds long, representing the best of what he’s shot, which represents the library of B-roll for a particular video. Boyechko has honed his shoot-to-edit approach to a fine science, and is currently traveling to local PBS affiliates around the U.S. to train their producers on making Web shorts.</p>
<p>Directors who have edited their own work tend to develop an intuitive sense of how much and what types of video clips they need to collect, Slater says, so it pays to edit your own work or at least familiarize yourself with the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Camera Choices</strong></p>
<p>Many B-roll shoots are “bring your own” as far as cameras and lenses are concerned. But on larger projects, Chapman likes to ensure consistent camera platforms are used across the project for ease of editing. The gear used on B-roll, he adds, should be more “agile and free-flowing” so the B-roll operator can more easily capture unique and offbeat angles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Boyechko, being nimble means relying on a monopod, not a tripod, while shooting B-roll. He also uses B-roll filming to switch up focal lengths. If he’s shooting alone, he’ll mostly rely on the 24–105mm f/4L lens on his Canon EOS C100 and keep it “super close” to the subject as the tight shots are easier to edit. For variety, Boyechko also leans on an 11–16mm f/2.8 Tokina, a 70–200mm telephoto and a slider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remembering how the human visual sense evolved helps Slater compose his B-roll. “People’s eyes are built to take in the savannah and broad fields: We don’t want a slow zoom on the lion, but a quick cut to the thing we care about,” he says. In terms of gear, that means using dollies when possible instead of panning and zooming because dolly shots mimic “how your eyes physically move through space,” Slater says.</p>
<p>Whatever your technique, B-roll is the arena for your creativity. Putting shooters in a B-roll position “is the best way to see how good they are,” Rothstein says.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[The digital age has given creative professionals many impressive tools. Access to powerful laptops and online networks are just some of the many advances allowing today’s creative talent to become a truly distributed workforce. The availability of editing software, high-speed Internet connections and FTP clients are also among the more obvious features changing the industry. 
<p>Sadly, the options for networking and collaborating on creative projects haven’t evolved at the same speed. Far too many photographers, directors and their collaborators are still relying on long email chains, text-based instant messaging, and unsecure photo/video sites for feedback and review with clients and team members, often leading to a chain of confusion. Does your client have the right codec for the rough cut you uploaded? Who asked for the blonde model instead of the brunette, the art director or the Vice President? Which edit did marketing finally sign off on?</p>
<p>Thankfully, that is starting to change. A new generation of companies is currently developing Web-based tools to address the needs of creative professionals. From finding and connecting with talent for a specific project, to client feedback and cloud-based editing, there is a new dawn for creative collaboration. Here are three sites worth taking a look at.</p>
<p><strong>Social Connection</strong></p>
<p>Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and the rest of today’s social media have their uses. But promoting yourself and connecting with creative professionals in the middle of the constant white noise can be frustrating, if not downright impossible. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.movidiam.com">Movidiam</a>, a U.K.-based company, aims to change that. Covering everything from the initial search to final payment, Movidiam offers online job listings, media asset uploading, video reviewing, interactive feedback and even storyboarding templates. </p>
<p>“With Movidiam, we have looked at the transient, project-by-project nature of the film industry and focused on fusing a social network and project management tools specific for commercial filmmaking. By creating profiles, filmmakers become visible to those searching for their talents, and can easily collaborate with project management features,” says Movidiam co-founder George Olver. “A lot of the collaboration tools currently on the market aimed at filmmakers are single-proposition tools that look at one element of the process. With Movidiam, we’ve looked at the process as a whole from profile search and networking, through to project management and payments.” </p>
<p>One of the most intriguing aspects of <a href="http://www.movidiam.com">Movidiam</a> is its “testimonial credit” reputation system, designed to help good work to be shared and recognized within the network and within the industry. Movidiam has also created a secure payment option for freelancers. Now you can pay or get paid from around the globe in multiple currencies. Combine all of this with Movidiam’s identity verification system, and you have the makings of an accurate, trustworthy ecosystem for creative professionals.</p>
<p>With a free account you can showcase your work, connect with the community, work on projects, and even get paid through their payment systems. Plans that include the use of Movidiam’s project and team-management features start at $25/month. </p>
<p><strong>Collaboration and Client Feedback</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest headaches for creative professionals working remotely is to connect with clients for feedback and approval. Miscommunication between you and a client can cause delays and problems down the road. Whether your fault or not, clients won’t recommend someone they’ve had communication problems with, particularly if they affected the final product or deadline.</p>
<p><a href="http://wipster.io">Wipster</a> promises a way around those troubles. As Wipster’s CEO Rollo Wenlock explains, “There’s a clear gap in the toolset for professional video producers, teammates and clients to collaborate together during the creation process. Traditionally, the video review and approval process has been inaccurate and inefficient, creating unhappy clients, misguided video, and freelancers with dwindling client bases.” </p>
<p>With drag-and-drop uploading, pro-level encoding, the capability to add feedback notes directly on top of the footage, automated to-do lists from those notes, client notification when a new version is uploaded and an archive of all older versions, Wipster has a robust feature set. “From day one we’ve aimed for absolute simplicity within the app. We believe in the mantra ‘do less, better.’ One feature that has remained very simple but which has incredible power is the ‘point and click’ commenting. When watching an edit, you simply click anywhere on the image, on any frame, to provide feedback. This is automatically sent to everyone else on the version review,” to which they can reply with agreement or disagreement, says Wenlock. While video has been Wipster’s initial focus, the goal going forward is to be a medium for sharing and collaborating on any form of creative content, from audio to images to design.</p>
<p>Used by companies as global as NBC Universal and as tech-savvy as Evernote, <a href="http://wipster.io">Wipster</a> still has much to offer the individual working professional. Accounts are free for basic users, and start at $25/month for more upload time and larger teams. </p>
<p><strong>Online Editing</strong></p>
<p>What if, instead of just sharing video, your team could actually edit your production remotely from anywhere there was a high-speed Internet connection? <a href="http://www.wevideo.com">WeVideo</a> offers cloud-based video editing and takes the concept of remote creative collaboration to a whole new level. </p>
<p>After video clips are uploaded to WeVideo—either directly or imported from other online storage sites—they become available to all team members. Your team can edit each other’s videos from different locations and devices. There is even an option to allow comments by colleagues or clients outside the team. Three different display options (Storyboard, Timeline Simple and Timeline Advanced) help tailor the editing interface for beginners, experts and everyone in-between. The editor itself is not so robust—think more iMovie than Final Cut Pro. Still, WeVideo has been adding features at a rapid pace. A recent update saw the addition of animation capabilities for moving titles and the Ken Burns photo-effect. Green Screen and Picture-in-Picture options are two more examples of WeVideo’s more advanced editing functionality. </p>
<p>Perhaps most fascinating of all is the fact that WeVideo offers iOS and Android apps that allow for basic storyboard-based editing. Not only has WeVideo eliminated the need for teams to be chained to powerful desktop computers, but they’ve started down the path of eliminating computers completely. Your production team could, in theory, exist anywhere and use almost any device.</p>
<p>With a claimed 2 million monthly users, <a href="http://www.wevideo.com">WeVideo</a> has seen rapid interest and adoption by everyone from NBC Universal to individual working creative pros. The most basic account option is free and paid plans with more storage, export time, and features start at $4/month.</p>
<p><strong>And More </strong></p>
<p>While Movidiam, WeVideo, and Wipster are three sites worth trying out, they are far from your only options. Looking for a social site with an indie-film feel? <a href="http://teamprocreate.com">Team ProCreate</a> may fit the bill. The site gives creatives a chance to promote their work as well as advertise or respond to job and collaboration opportunities. Monthly mixers add a touch of old school networking for those in the Los Angeles area. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.getfeedbac.com">Feedbac</a>, just out of beta, offers feedback/review collaboration capabilities with unlimited projects and contributors. Pricing is based solely on storage space needed. </p>
<p>Unlike many of the companies in this space, <a href="https://www.mediasilo.com/">MediaSilo</a> has been around for a while. Although it’s a more costly option, it has also been trusted by professionals for years and has features—such as Adobe Premiere integration and an available API—not offered by other sites. Even large companies see the importance of these offerings. Sony is behind <a href="https://www.sonymcs.com/">Ci</a>, a very slick-looking media asset review, management and archiving system. While Ci doesn’t offer cloud editing like WeVideo, we wouldn’t be surprised to see a company like Sony make a move in that direction. </p>
<p>If you’ve been doing your client feedback and collaboration the same way you did ten years ago, it might be time to make a move to something more accurate, secure, and easy to use. These sites can’t promise that a client will love your work, but they will give you a far better shot at having their feelings clearly communicated.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Photographer <a href="http://www.ashleygilbertson.com/about.html">Ashley Gilbertson</a> and cinematographer Tim Grucza were friends growing up in Melbourne, and in the early 2000s began traveling the world together as freelance journalists covering conflicts. But they always worked for different clients until 2012, when Gilbertson was photographing the bedrooms of fallen service men and women, a project that would eventually lead to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bedrooms-Fallen-Ashley-Gilbertson/dp/022606686X">his 2014 book,</a> <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bedrooms-Fallen-Ashley-Gilbertson/dp/022606686X">Bedrooms of the Fallen</a>.</em> While working on the project, he’d met the family of Ryan Yurchison, an Iraq war veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder who committed suicide after falling through the bureaucratic cracks of the Veterans Administration. 
<p>“We thought it was a much larger story” than just another photograph for <em>Bedrooms of the Fallen</em>, Gilbertson says. “So Tim came out, and we shot a video together.” </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/opinion/good-night-ryan.html">It was picked up by the</a> <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/opinion/good-night-ryan.html">New York Times</a></em>, and marked the start of an ongoing collaboration. “If we can pool our resources, knowledge, and experience, we believe we have a really impressive service to offer [clients],” Grucza says. </p>
<p>In 2014, Gilbertson and Grucza produced <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/firestone-and-the-warlord-video">several videos</a> for a joint TV and multimedia production by ProPublica and PBS’s <em>Frontline</em> about the role of the Firestone corporation in Liberia’s bloody civil war. They also produced a series of <a href="http://vimeo.com/85223312">branded testimonial videos for AXA insurance</a>, and still and video content for the Ad Council’s Smokey the Bear Instagram feed.</p>
<p>They bring complementary skills to the partnership. Many clients now expect photographers to provide still and video content, but Gilbertson says he long resisted video because of the technical challenges. Grucza is an Emmy Award-winning cinematographer and a “brilliant” editor, Gilbertson says. </p>
<p>For his part, Gilbertson is an award-winning photographer with production and people skills. “I like to play more of a supporting role,” Grucza says. “I can be fully invested in the part of the work I enjoy, and leave finding the next job and talking to clients and all that stuff to Ashley, who excels at it.”</p>
<p>They complement each other in other ways, too. Gilbertson has ambitious ideas, while Grucza keeps their joint projects grounded. “You need someone who doesn’t know their limits, or is always prepared to push beyond them. My ideal collaborator is someone who has the balls to take the risk,” says Grucza, explaining that cinematographers tend to be risk-averse because film production is so expensive.</p>
<p>“Tim will talk me back from doing pieces that are too far out, too conceptual,” Gilbertson says. As a photographer, he’s used to figuring out the narrative arc of his stories as he edits a take. Grucza forces him to define the narrative arc of their joint projects in advance. “He’ll ask, ‘What is the story?’” Gilbertson says, recalling that when he pitched the video about Ryan Yurchison, Grucza said, “Ryan’s dead. What do we shoot?”</p>
<p>They don’t divide the labor, but work together as co-directors, from concept to production to editing and postproduction. When there’s still photography to be shot—as with the AXA Insurance project, which featured stills with voiceover audio—Grucza goes on location with Gilbertson to help shoot and act as a second set of eyes.</p>
<p>“Tim says, ‘Did you see what’s happening over here, did you see what happened when you moved this person over here?’ He’s a great experimenter with frames, which I very much appreciate. If I’m not careful, I can find a comfort level with what I’m shooting and stick to it. So it’s great having somebody to actually challenge me and push me,” Gilbertson says.</p>
<p>Similarly, Gilbertson serves as a second cameraman to Grucza. And Gilbertson sits in the editing suite with Grucza, making decisions and often arguing the choices. To resolve disagreements, they sleep on the options, review them the next day, “and one of us will look at the other and say, ‘Screw you. I told you so,’” says Gilbertson. “We’re both Australian, so there would be nothing polite about it.”</p>
<p>But their egos don’t get in the way. “When you’re both putting your name on something, you will both suffer as a result of your weakest picture. So the only thing you care about when you’re sitting in that edit suite is the strongest work you can possibly get. So it doesn’t matter who shot it.”</p>
<p>Gilbertson and Grucza say their collaboration is so successful because of their long friendship and mutual respect for each other’s work. Gilbertson explains that the learning curve of collaboration “is in some cases pretty brutal” because the partners have to get used to different approaches to storytelling and working—including how they move physically, so as not to get in each other’s way. “We work in unison, and I think that’s thanks to decades of knowing each other,” Grucza says.</p>
<p>They’ve agreed to share copyright and split fees 50/50 on everything they co-direct, although they retain individual ownership of underlying elements of their joint projects. For instance, Gilbertson owns the copyright to the still images and audio recordings that he made for the ProPublica videos. (Grucza, who was off shooting video at the same time for <em>Frontline</em>, didn’t help Gilbertson with the still images on that project.)</p>
<p>The partnership isn’t without some challenges, however. Scheduling is a big one. They continue to work separately on editorial assignments, so finding the time to work on joint projects—especially for editorial clients, who often can’t afford to hire them as co-directors—is difficult. Another challenge has been convincing clients that their skills as journalists translate to commercial work. </p>
<p>They’re working on that challenge. Last year, they made <a href="https://vimeo.com/69166758">a short video</a> to show how they could find “amazing, compelling people” and tell a story on a tight schedule and minimal budget. Gilbertson initiated it. “He called and said, ‘Are you up? Let’s go out and make something,’” Grucza recounts.</p>
<p>In search of a subject, they walked into New York’s Penn Station with a couple of cameras and an audio recorder, and noticed a guy carrying a saxophone. It turned out to be Ben Casey, a Grammy Award-winning musician on his way to a gig in Philadelphia. Grucza and Gilbertson asked if they could tag along, and spent half a day shooting, and another day editing.</p>
<p>The project was something that either one of them could have done on their own, Grucza says, “but it’s a lot more fun to do together.” And it resulted in a video that demonstrated their combined skills, and helped land the assignments they’ve produced together in the past year. </p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Photographer <a href="http://jessedittmar.com/">Jesse Dittmar’s</a> career took off last year after <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater_dance/idina-menzel-defying-gravity-again/2013/10/31/d138f8f0-40d7-11e3-b028-de922d7a3f47_story.html">an assignment to photograph actress and musician Idina Menzel for</a> <em><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater_dance/idina-menzel-defying-gravity-again/2013/10/31/d138f8f0-40d7-11e3-b028-de922d7a3f47_story.html">The Washington Post</a></em><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater_dance/idina-menzel-defying-gravity-again/2013/10/31/d138f8f0-40d7-11e3-b028-de922d7a3f47_story.html">.</a> Suddenly he was getting calls to shoot celebrities for <em>Rolling Stone</em>, the <em>Village Voice</em> and <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>, among other magazines. He has since landed advertising jobs, too.
<p>What seemed like sudden success, though, was the culmination of a long, sustained effort to launch his career. He’d worked for five years as an assistant, building his portfolio all the while with test shoots. Once he stopped assisting, he spent more than a year trying to meet as many photo editors as he could, and taking any small job that came his way. “I had 50 to 100 meetings with people before I got the <em>Post</em> job,” he says. </p>
<p>Every job he’s landed so far has resulted directly or indirectly from those meetings. “Word of mouth is the most important thing,” he says. “That combined with shooting as much as possible so I can meet people.”</p>
<p>Dittmar started assisting right out of college. He freelanced for three years, then spent two years as a full-time assistant for <a href="http://www.benbakerphoto.com/index.php">Ben Baker</a>. “As a freelancer, you get to see how different photographers do things, how they solve problems, what kind of lighting they use, [and] how they interact with people. Working with Ben, it was valuable to see the process every step of the way.”</p>
<p>From Baker, Dittmar learned how to handle big celebrity shoots. “Ben is a master of getting as many setups as he can in very little time,” Dittmar says, recounting the seven setups Baker managed to pull off in a 20-minute session with Michelle Obama at the White House. </p>
<p>In his spare time, Dittmar did test shoots. “My goal was not to be an assistant. It was to be a photographer,” he says. About two years ago, he reached the point where he wasn’t learning any more as an assistant. He started showing his portfolio around to potential clients, and decided to quit assisting altogether in late 2012 when he was forced to choose between an assisting job and a small assignment. “I wanted photo editors and art buyers to think of me as a photographer, not an assistant,” he says. </p>
<p>Dittmar credits a college friend, <a href="http://llrepsnews.com/?page_id=7001">Jacqueline Bovaird of LL Reps</a>, with helping him get his career as a photographer started. “She would push me: ‘Go to photography events, go meet people, go talk to them.’ That got me off my ass to go to meetings [with potential clients]” Dittmar says.</p>
<p>Those meetings started paying off slowly with small assignments. For instance, he showed his portfolio to <em>BlackBook</em> magazine, which doesn’t pay fees, but takes chances on new talent. Dittmar hit it off with the photo editor because he had pictures in his portfolio of several Brooklyn-based indie bands that they both liked. </p>
<p>Through <em>BlackBook</em> assignments, he ended up meeting a publicist who had dated one of his best friends from high school. As a result of that connection, he got his first assignment shooting actor and B-list celebrity Josh Gad.</p>
<p>Those connections happen over and over again “because I don’t sit at home. I’m not some brooding artist in the corner,” Dittmar says. “I like meeting people. I like talking about my work, about what the people I meet are doing. I consider meetings [with clients] very much like shoots, figuring out what the person I’m meeting with is about.”</p>
<p>Everywhere he travels, Dittmar tries to arrange meetings with clients he wants to work for. “Most of the meetings I go to, I know the publication because I’m a fan,” he says.  </p>
<p>He got a meeting in the fall of 2013 with Anne Farrar, senior photo editor for features at <em>The Washington Post</em>. Shortly afterwards, she needed someone in New York to photograph Menzel, who provided the voice of the Snow Queen Elsa in <em>Frozen</em>, the 2013 Disney animated film. </p>
<p>“He charmed me with his passion and drive to succeed. It didn’t hurt that he had been a successful assistant dealing with high-profile personalities,” Farrar says, adding that she also saw in his portfolio “a glimmer of where he was going with his style and lighting technique.”</p>
<p>Around the same time he photographed Menzel, Dittmar sent a personal email to <em>Village Voice</em> art director Jesus Diaz, explaining that it was his dream to shoot for the publication. He got a meeting with Diaz, and then got a call the same day to shoot a cover photo of singer Sharon Jones. </p>
<p>“That picture re-sold to <em>Rolling Stone,</em> <em>New York</em> magazine, and a bunch of others. That was huge for me,” Dittmar says.</p>
<p>One of Dittmar’s strategies has been to take every assignment he’s offered, no matter how small, because those assignments lead to unexpected opportunities. “If I have time, I’ll shoot it. That’s how I got Wheels Up,” he says.</p>
<p>The New York-based jet taxi service is his biggest commercial client to date. He’s shot three assignments, all of them testimonial ads showing portraits of people who use the service posed inside or in front of the client’s jets.</p>
<p>Dittmar got his first Wheels Up assignment because a college friend told him that her new boss needed a head shot. He took the job. “I treated it like a magazine shoot, and took the best picture I could,” he says. His friend’s boss loved it. </p>
<p>“Four months later I got an e-mail from her”—his friend’s boss—“with an art director’s name attached.” The message was a recommendation for Dittmar to the art director on the Wheels Up account. </p>
<p>“My entire career to this point has been 100-percent predicated on interactions like that,” Dittmar says. “If you knock it out of the park, and you’re nice, people are going to think of you for the next thing they need.”</p>
<p>Dittmar’s goal now is to expand his advertising work. He has just signed with commercial rep <a href="http://www.cynthiaheld.com/">Cynthia Held</a> (Redux will continue to represent him for editorial stock sales). Dittmar says, “Cynthia immediately doubles my efforts. She’s going to push me to do the [traditional] marketing to expand my business that way.” </p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[The interconnectedness of communities and the way people form a sense of place are central themes in <a href="http://dennisdehartcom.fatcow.com/photography/sample-page/confluences/">Dennis DeHart’s project “Confluences.”</a> Through landscapes, portraiture, video and archival images, the project looks at the Columbia Basin—the drainage basin of the Columbia River—which encompasses parts of Washington, Idaho, Oregon, Wyoming and Western Canada. 
<p>After moving to Eastern Washington to assume an assistant professor of photography position at Washington State University, <a href="http://dennisdehartcom.fatcow.com/photography/">DeHart</a> began exploring the area around his new home. The Columbia River is a dominant physical feature of the landscape in Oregon, where DeHart grew up, and DeHart was drawn back to the Columbia and the network of connected rivers around it when he resettled further east in the Palouse, an agricultural region that encompasses parts of Washington and Idaho. </p>
<p>The concept of bioregionalism, a system of thinking that defines areas not by political borders but by geographical features and ecological similarities, inspired DeHart to take a wide view of the area. “I’m trying to find connections amongst different communities that maybe politically don’t share a similar ideology,” he says. “But we all like rivers for the most part.” By speaking with a range of people, from landscape architects to scientists, environmentalists to salmon researchers, DeHart began to piece together an understanding of the Columbia Basin, and how the river systems connect and feed the identity of the entire region.</p>
<p>DeHart began the project in 2012, and the ongoing work currently includes four parts, which he refers to as “short stories.” With an exhibition coming up this fall at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California, DeHart is currently working on photographs and video pieces that explore the historic significance and current challenges faced by salmon populations, which travel hundreds of miles inland from the Pacific Ocean through the river systems to spawn. In his research, DeHart says, he was “struck that there is this unifying creature that links the northwest identity,” he says. “They are amazing creatures. There is a certain poetry and grace in them.”</p>
<p>Part one of the project provides an exploratory overview of the region. We see tree farms, shooting ranges, boathouses on a glassy lake, bridges that span the rivers. In one image, a signpost in the shape of a salmon stands in front of a section of river, bearing some sort of warning for fishermen or swimmers. In another we see the front gate of an Army chemical depot.</p>
<p>DeHart’s portraits show people he came across—mostly by happenstance—during his explorations on foot, by bicycle and by car, often with his children in tow as they explored the area. In one photograph a bleach-blonde young woman poses in front of long-vacant storefront. In another, a ranger at the Nez Perce National Historic Park in Idaho stands in her uniform with her arms at her sides.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://placesjournal.org/article/heavy-metal/">“Heavy Metal,”</a> the series that forms the second part of the project, DeHart made photographs along a 73-mile recreational trail that’s built atop a former railroad in Silver Lake, a large, contaminated former mining district that is a Superfund site. The tranquility and natural beauty of the landscapes belie the environmental impact of the mining operations. While exploring the region by bicycle, DeHart wrote in an essay about the work, “I encountered a black bear crossing the trail, a river otter building a home in the wetlands, and waterfowl fishing in Lake Chacolet, all while rolling along a thick asphalt cap built to contain a century’s worth of toxic waste.”</p>
<p>One of DeHart’s primary aims for the work is to spark discussion. “I’d like people to enjoy the photographs, to visually be engaged with the spaces and the people and the places, but I’d [also] like to have a conversation,” he says. DeHart is also driven to contribute to broader discussions about land use and conservation, river ecosystems, and other issues. At different stages, he’s published parts of the work in an architecture journal, has shown the work at an exhibition in Dublin, and has lectured about it at the Universit&eacute; de Nantes, France. </p>
<p>The opportunity to add to his own understanding also drives DeHart. “I’m really passionate about what I’m doing and I’m always just excited about learning more,” he says. He’s interested, he says, in “this broader idea of place and what place means, and valuing place and understanding my own place.” In some ways DeHart’s episodic approach to “Confluences” echoes the concept of bioregionalism, of connections that are organic rather than strictly imposed. “We often want to make things succinct and tidy, and tied up in a nice package, but as a visual artist I have the luxury of being a little more open ended,” he says.</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Before they ever met, <a href="http://www.megancaponetto.com/">Megan Caponetto</a> had aspired to work with <a href="http://mitch.fr/">Mitchell Feinberg</a>. When Caponetto, a prop stylist and fabricator, had gained enough experience and was ready to sign with an agency, she chose <a href="http://www.apostrophe.net/">Apostrophe</a> because Feinberg was on its roster of photographers. When it came time to work with him, she ensured there was nothing distracting her from the project.
<p>“I wouldn’t take a job with Mitch unless I knew that I had, like, a week to prepare,” Caponetto says, “so I knew that I would be 100 percent.”</p>
<p>Feinberg has been shooting luxury still lifes for more than 15 years, doing commercial work for fashion houses, cosmetics and jewelry brands, as well as brands like Nike and Coca-Cola and editorial assignments for <em>Num&eacute;ro</em>, <em>T: The New York Times Style Magazine, Vogue </em>and <em>Marie Claire</em>.</p>
<p>Caponetto got her start in 1999, assisting the prop stylist <a href="http://www.rickfloyd.com/">Rick Floyd</a>, working on sets with Annie Leibovitz and Fabien Baron. She’s styled still life shoots with subjects as small as dust (<a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/Turning-Objects-Into-6889.shtml">a “dust bunny,” shot by Jamie Chung for</a> <em><a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/Turning-Objects-Into-6889.shtml">Real Simple</a></em>) and as large as a field of corn, like the cover shot by Vincent Laforet that she styled for <em>The New York Times Magazine</em>. </p>
<p>The pair have only been working together for a few years, but the partnership has already produced some of their most iconic work. Feinberg’s compositions stand out for their nuanced touches of humanity in an otherwise perfect scene. </p>
<p>“I think he and I both love very natural things, like the crooks of a rock,” Caponetto explains. “Things are never really 100-percent planned, so there’s this wonderful ‘What might happen on set?’ quality.”</p>
<p>“We’ll find things that are perfect and beautiful, but they’re not zero one perfect. There’s still a little mess in there,” Feinberg says. “That’s what often makes photographs intriguing.”</p>
<p>On a recent commercial job for MAC Cosmetics, Caponetto painted the backdrop and also fabricated plants. If it’s a particularly time-consuming task, they will do it together, and often Caponetto has to prepare the props well in advance. But when it comes to actually arranging objects in the frame, Feinberg typically styles shots himself, so there’s no room for hubris from the stylist. It helps that Caponetto loves Feinberg’s arrangements.</p>
<p>“I love that I like his styling,” she explains, “because I’ve worked with photographers who do their own styling, I’ve had to bring the props, and I don’t like their styling at all. So I don’t work with them anymore.”</p>
<p>Once Feinberg has put the shot together, they both evaluate it. “Then it’s a give and take as to what’s working what’s not,” Feinberg explains.</p>
<p>Caponetto can spend dozens of hours preparing props for a shoot, but on a Feinberg shoot, everyone needs to be able to adapt on set. <a href="http://www.apostrophe.net/news/mitchell-feinberg-megan-caponetto-marie-claire-5">On a recent accessories shoot for</a> <em><a href="http://www.apostrophe.net/news/mitchell-feinberg-megan-caponetto-marie-claire-5">Marie Claire</a></em>, Caponetto had spent a week weaving patterns to fit the accessories, but when Feinberg set up the first shot, it was clear that everything was too neat. So he asked her to undo the weave she had spent hours working on. “And I wasn’t screaming in the background!” Caponetto says.</p>
<p>“She understood what was happening,” Feinberg says. “You have everything going in a good direction, everyone is growing together, and then you have spontaneity…things that are different to look at.”</p>
<p>“It didn’t work,” Caponetto admits, “and it doesn’t matter how much time you put into it, if Mitch doesn’t like it, it goes in the garbage, and we find a remedy. There’s mutual respect, so that it doesn’t hurt either one of our feelings.”</p>
<p>Beyond their technical skill, the pair’s compatible dispositions make collaboration easy. Caponetto’s bubbly personality complements Feinberg’s fastidiousness in the studio. He likes to have the smallest team on set that he can get away with, and having someone as versatile as Caponetto—who can fabricate models and design sets in addition to styling props—on set is invaluable. Feinberg finds it helpful to be giving directions to the person who is doing the physical work. </p>
<p>“I often find that people either bring energy to a room or they take it away,” Feinberg says. “I like having a lot of good energy and good vibes in a space. Personality is very important to me.”</p>
<p>Collaborators on a photo shoot often speak in references, and if they’ve worked together long enough, their own vernacular or shorthand. But Caponetto and Feinberg take it a step further—sometimes they understand the other better than they understand themselves. When Feinberg has trouble explaining what he’s looking for, Caponetto can easily parse his intentions. </p>
<p>“When I’m not sure what I’m saying, it’s a translation,” Feinberg says. “I have an idea, but I’m not quite clear what my idea is, and then she says ‘Oh, what you really mean is…’”</p>
<p>Of all the work the two have made together, Caponetto’s favorite is probably the weaving story for <em>Marie Claire</em>. She pitched him the idea when they first met, but it would be more than 18 months before it would come to fruition. Initially elated that he had remembered her pitch, she would soon come to realize just how monumental a task all the weaving was. She pulled several overnights to be able to show up on set with everything completed.</p>
<p>“No matter what, I have to show up at 9 a.m. with it correct,” Caponetto says. “But it was worth it for me, because you never see that in an editorial.”</p>
<p>But it was <a href="http://www.apostrophe.net/news/mitchell-feinberg-boston-magazine-cover">the cover they shot for</a> <em><a href="http://www.apostrophe.net/news/mitchell-feinberg-boston-magazine-cover">Boston</a></em> <em><a href="http://www.apostrophe.net/news/mitchell-feinberg-boston-magazine-cover">Magazine</a></em>, in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing, that is arguably their most emotive work. Brian Struble, the magazine’s design director at the time, conceived the shot of marathon runners’ shoes arranged as a heart, and drove 150 pairs of shoes from Boston to the studio in Manhattan. With an impending print deadline and only one day to do everything, everyone—Feinberg, Caponetto, retoucher Shin Ono, Feinberg’s assistant—was on the floor, laying out sneakers. Everything was flight-checked, retouched and out the door by midnight. The resulting shot became one of the most iconic magazine covers of 2013. </p>
<p>“Still life is generally not time sensitive,” Feinberg says. “The photograph that you made last year, you could make this year. That one was a very moving shoot for us. It’s the kind of thing that’s rare in still life…an opportunity to make a photograph that can’t be repeated.” </p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[“I became a photographer because I liked working alone,” says <a href="http://alecsoth.com/photography/">Alec Soth</a>, one half of the photographer-writer team that created <em><a href="http://www.littlebrownmushroom.com/">Little Brown Mushroom Dispatches</a></em>, a series of seven newspapers published between 2011–2014 that delve into the culture of exurban communities in several U.S. states. Independence, isolation and the impulse to run away from society have been themes in Soth’s work. His 2010 book, <em><a href="http://alecsoth.com/photography/?page_id=213">Broken Manual</a></em>, is a sort of guidebook for people interested in living off the grid, in solitude. He created the book over the course of five years, driving around in a van, seeking out people who were uninterested in being found. Soth’s solitary impulse, however, faded at some point. “I was just hungry for more interaction,” he says.
<p>Brad Zellar, the writer behind <em>Dispatches</em>, shares Soth’s outsider perspective. Before they started the project, Zellar had lived for eight months in a cabin “with no heat or plumbing” with only his dog as a companion. “Neither of us are really joiners or belongers,” says Zeller who, like Soth, now lives in Minnesota’s Twin Cities. </p>
<p>Though Soth and Zellar had worked on other publications together—Zellar, for instance, wrote <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Conductors-Moving-World-Brad-Zellar/dp/B005RR98V8">Conductors of the Moving World</a></em>, “a Zen travelogue through 1972 America” that featured images taken by a Japanese police official on a tour of U.S. cities, and which was published by Soth’s Little Brown Mushroom imprint—<em>Dispatches</em> was their first true collaborative project.</p>
<p>Inspired in part by the book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bowling-Alone-Collapse-American-Community/dp/0743203046">Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community by Robert D. Putnam</a></em>, Zellar and Soth wondered what was left of the fabric of American communities in the digital age. They wondered how community groups like the Elks, the American Legion and local churches were faring, Zellar recalls. “It’s very hard to get a sense of that when you live in a big city, so our idea was to go as far out as we need to get from the Twin Cities to actually take the pulse of these real, older communities.”</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it didn’t take a lot of travel. Within 35 minutes of the Twin Cities, Zellar recalls, they found places that felt like different worlds, ones that weren’t just collections of homes around “constellations” of retail chains and restaurants. “There still were these service clubs that were the social hubs of the community, there were these little small-town business expos and little churches that were active,” Zellar says. </p>
<p>Both men had also worked for small community news publications at one time, and the experience of documenting local communities as small-town reporters also helped inform the project. </p>
<p>In the <em>Dispatches</em>, Soth’s portraits of locals and photographs of historical sites, community centers, churches and events interact with Zellar’s biographical sketches, short histories, quotations and essays. The newspapers reveal, with curiosity, a sense of humor and respect, something of the past and present in a handful of American communities.</p>
<p>Soth and Zellar eventually self-funded seven trips, publishing the newspapers for each state they visited in editions of 2000, which they sold for $18. (They also published special, signed editions of the newspapers packaged with a Soth print in a hardcover case for $350.)</p>
<p>Prior to each trip, Zellar and Soth would research the state to which they planned to travel, and suggest things they’d like to explore. Once they were on the road, riding in a van with an assistant, the push and pull of their different ideas, perspectives and curiosities constantly landed them in unexpected places, Zellar says. They also pushed each other. “I’m a pretty adventurous character and I like to talk to people,” Zellar says, “but there are so many things that we have done on these projects that I never would have done…. It gives you a certain courage, it emboldens you to have someone else there.” Soth echoes that sentiment.</p>
<p>Each also benefitted from the information the other was gathering. Soth says he’s often asked whether he has a deep connection with his portraiture subjects, but as he explains, “I’m so consumed with making the picture and the way things look that it’s hard to carry on a conversation with people. I think they’re fascinating and have amazing stories, but I need to be using my eyes and I just can’t be listening that closely, and so to know that information is being gathered is such a relief.”</p>
<p>Soth also appreciated Zellar’s research, which informed the short texts that worked with the photographs without just describing what’s in the image. “I love photography but it’s so shallow, it’s just a collection of surfaces, so people’s stories and histories and that sort of thing aren’t apparent,” Soth says. “It’s troubled me in the past. And so to know that’s being collected is fantastic, and that combination of bringing all of that other material to the table along with the creative impetus to really get out there and keep working is really powerful.”</p>
<p>For his part, Zellar benefitted from the notational function of Soth’s photographs. “I can look at those photos and each of them is basically like the equivalent of a notebook full of information.”</p>
<p>Soth and Zellar note that the assistants who worked with them on the road, and the designers and other people behind the scenes who helped produce the <em>Dispatches</em> were all part of the collaborative process.</p>
<p>“We often use the band metaphor,” Zellar says. “The good bands are bands [in which] each person brings a certain collaborative energy to the project, and to me that’s the signature of all of these trips. It’s just this incredible, constant surging adrenaline, and I don’t have that when I work alone.”</p>
<p>Since finishing their last “dispatch” in Georgia in 2014, the pair taught together as artists-in-residence at the University of Madison-Wisconsin, and in January of this year, Soth released a book of photographs from the Dispatches project, <em><a href="http://mackbooks.co.uk/books/1057-Songbook.html">Songbook</a></em> <a href="http://mackbooks.co.uk/books/1057-Songbook.html">(MACK)</a>. Their goal is to produce a trade publication that encompasses all of the <em>Dispatches</em> work.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<em>Los Angeles Times</em> photographer <a href="http://framework.latimes.com/who-we-are/don-bartletti/">Don Bartletti</a> has covered difficult stories in Mexico for decades, including the drug wars and illegal immigration. But his most recent project, about the explosion of inexpensive Mexican produce exported to the U.S., turned out to be one of the most difficult, he says.
<p>Called <a href="http://graphics.latimes.com/product-of-mexico-stores/">“Product of Mexico,”</a> the story ran as a four-part series in print and online in December. It all started in 2013, when Bartletti and <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reporter <a href="http://www.latimes.com/la-bio-richard-marosi-staff.html">Richard Marosi</a> pitched the story together. “[We] initially chatted about an upbeat, show-and-tell expose about all the states in Mexico that produced half of America’s table veggies,” says Bartletti.</p>
<p>The story they spent more than a year reporting turned instead into an expose on illegal child labor and human-rights violations on Mexican farms. Those violations directly benefit major U.S. food distributors and U.S. consumers by keeping produce prices artificially low.</p>
<p>“I wanted to give our readers visual proof that impoverished Mexican families are still sending kids to the fields rather than classrooms,” Bartletti said via email. “I hoped that American brokers and retailers would be ashamed…I wanted everyone to scream what Dorothea Lange said about what she witnessed during the Dust Bowl Era, ‘How can such things be?!’”</p>
<p>The project was funded in part by a grant from the Ford Foundation, awarded to the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> to support coverage of various Latin American issues.   </p>
<p>Between July 2013 and July 2014, Bartletti took six trips to Mexico that lasted about two weeks each. He ended up following farm laborers through a complete cycle of migration as they followed the harvest of one crop to the next. He and Marosi worked together on some of the trips. But Bartletti often worked alone, in order to keep a low profile. “We weren’t exactly welcome” by farm owners, he says.</p>
<p>His strategy was to approach a field, and introduce himself to the field boss—usually someone working for a contractor supplying labor to the farm owners. “We never lied about who we were,” Bartletti emphasizes. He and Marosi always asked if the crop was grown for export to the U.S., because one goal of the project was to test the claims of U.S. importers that they were buying only from farms that paid fair wages, treated workers well, and used no child labor.</p>
<p>“We found the exact opposite,” Bartletti says.</p>
<p>The only way to tell the story, he says, was to get close-up access to families working in the fields, and living in migrant housing. “My style of photography is with a 24mm wide-angle lens,” he explains. “I want to be able to talk to people, hear them, feel them.”</p>
<p>The challenge was to get through the farm gates with his camera. He and Marosi started talking to workers outside the gates. “When subjects feel like somebody is trying to understand their plight, they open up,” Bartletti says. </p>
<p>Early on he met a group of about 50 workers—including 25 children—harvesting chili peppers in the Mexican state of Guanajuato. Among them was a 12-year-old girl named Alejandrina Castillo, and she was an ideal subject, Bartletti says. </p>
<p>“She was forced to work so her single mother and two brothers could survive,” he explains. “She was the swiftest child picker in the crew. At home she was the cook, laundry girl, babysitter and housekeeper but hadn’t lost her spontaneous playfulness.”</p>
<p>Over the course of a year, he kept track of the family through the labor contractor they worked for, and followed them from one farm pueblo to the next.</p>
<p>To gain access to the fields, Bartletti would put his cameras in plastic bags and wrap his tripod in a blanket, jump into the back of a pickup truck with the laborers, and ride through with them. “When the boss came around, I would just walk out of the field, and hitchhike back to the pueblo,” he says. </p>
<p>What Bartletti wasn’t aware of until he started the story were the closed labor camps inside the farms. He started hearing from workers about the deplorable living conditions, and how they were held in servitude by debt to company stores, and by labor contractors who withheld their wages to keep them from quitting.</p>
<p>“People would say, ‘We want to show you this,’ and that was the legal way in,” Bartletti says. He walked into one 12 x 12-foot living cubicle just as the family living there was preparing dinner, with tomatoes and cucumbers scavenged from the farm. “I climbed atop one of the upper concrete bunk beds and simply let the scene define itself,” he says.</p>
<p>He managed to get into the farm camps several times, always intending to spend the night. “I got caught every time,” by camp monitors, he says, adding, “It got very, very uncomfortable” a few times. But Bartletti always talked his way out of trouble. “I would say, ‘Listen, I don’t want to make your job harder, and I don’t want to make my life miserable. What if I just leave?’”</p>
<p>Bartletti worried constantly about being robbed of his cameras, or worse, having someone take away his camera cards. To safeguard his images, he would download them onto a laptop every night, and leave the laptop in the care of managers of the hotels where he stayed.</p>
<p>Overall, Bartletti says, “It wasn’t a happy assignment.” He describes it as emotionally and physically exhausting, and probably the most uncomfortable assignment he’s shot in his 30-year career at the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>. “The difficulty was witnessing such injustice,” he says. While packing for trips, he had feelings of dread, thinking, “I don’t want to do this. I don’t want to go.” </p>
<p>Part of the problem, he says, was that unlike other stories he’s done in Mexico, he chose to work on the produce story without a fixer, to maintain a low profile. “I had to rely on my instinct,” he says. “I’m not an especially courageous person.”</p>
<p>He had to talk himself into continuing every time. “I said, ‘No, this is not going to stop you. You’re going to go, and do it,’” he says.</p>
<p>Bartletti’s editors considered the story finished after Alejandrina’s family had made a complete migratory circuit, and the images showed compelling evidence of child labor and sub-standard conditions. But Bartletti says, “I’m never finished. I’m never satisfied.” One thing he regrets that he was unable to do, he says, was travel to the pueblos of southern Mexico where impoverished indigenous people living in mud huts are recruited by labor contractors to work as migrant farm workers in the north. </p>
<p>Bartletti did the initial edit himself, before turning his photographs over to Mary Cooney, director of photography and video at the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, for a final edit. He also shot video, which was a technical challenge to juggle while he was shooting stills. “The ideal scenario would have been to send a second photojournalist to focus on video,” Cooney says, but that “was out of the question. This was an investigative story; the fewer people involved, the more opportunity for success.”</p>
<p>Photographer <a href="http://framework.latimes.com/who-we-are/liz-o-baylen/">Liz O. Baylen</a> joined the project as creative producer to edit three videos, each about five minutes long. She called on the help of video journalists Spencer Bakalar and Bethany Mollenkof during the edit. “For this type of project to be successful, it really does take a village,” Cooney says. </p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Instagram has emerged as a source of income and opportunity for professional photographers, who work for brands and marketers creating images for the platform. Instagram also enables some advanced amateurs to turn pro. Followers are key. Instagramers with high follower counts achieve “influencer” status, which they can sell to brands looking to harness their networks and their understanding of how to engage an audience on the platform. Influence can also factor into whether or not a photographer is chosen for other commercial jobs.
<p>Instagram itself plays a role in helping a number of users increase their followings. Users who are featured on the <a href="https://instagram.com/instagram/">@Instagram</a> account or on the <a href="http://blog.instagram.com/">Instagram blog</a>, often see their audiences grow exponentially, which can be a path to influencer status. <em>PDN</em> recently interviewed Instagram Editorial Director Pamela Chen via email to find out about her role, and about how she and the community team decide which users to feature on the influential @Instagram account, which has 56 million followers, and blog.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What is your role as editorial director at Instagram?</strong><br />
Pamela Chen: I lead our community team’s efforts exploring new ways to highlight the Instagram community around the world. We share original stories to our editorial channels, primarily the @Instagram account and our blog. These are stories that spotlight the content created within the community, celebrating the diverse creativity that happens on Instagram every day.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What are the community team’s objectives?</strong><br />
PC: Discovery: Instagram is an ocean of creativity and we shine a light into its depths, leading people down the rabbit hole to discover and be inspired by some of the incredible things that the community is doing. By sharing these voices, we hope creators can connect with one another and keep the conversation going.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What is a typical day for you?</strong><br />
PC: I look at a lot of pictures. I’m always searching for surprising images and the origin stories behind them. Our team finds and interviews people about what drives their creative process. We’re experimenting with new ways to share these stories, such as with our recent analog exhibition at Photoville in New York City.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What criteria do you use to choose which Instagram accounts to highlight on the @Instagram account or blog?</strong><br />
PC: We look for inspiration and authenticity within the Instagram community.  We are drawn to individuals who open a window into their own creative lives and share their journey as it unfolds. The most exemplary community members don’t just share their images, but also contextualize their experiences through storytelling, and engage with their followers in conversation to expand their impact beyond the initial visual communication.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What, to you, makes for an interesting Instagram feed? Are there things that are common to users who have built large followings on Instagram?</strong><br />
PC: The best way to understand that is to follow the @Instagram account. Every day you’ll see the things our team is surfacing that we find fascinating. What’s appealing isn’t large numbers of followers, it’s work that is unique and sincere. It’s especially interesting when people experiment with integrating Instagram at the start of their creative process. When your feed is a living portfolio that grows and evolves as your eye does, your followers then have a chance to become invested your projects. How you curate here is just as much a part of your story as what the single images are.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Would you explain a bit more about what you mean by “creative process” in the context of Instagram?</strong><br />
PC: By creative process, I mean the process by which all photographers perpetually hone their personal way of seeing. At <em>National Geographic</em> magazine, the editors go on that journey with the photographers through their entire take, frame by frame. You try something, then you try something else. Eventually you settle in with what feels best for you, in order to tell the story you are trying to tell. Instagram has a part to play in that process too, in that by sharing your creative process on the platform, you are connecting with fellow artists and inspiring your audience to care about your vision as it evolves.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Can you give a couple of examples of photographers who’ve integrated Instagram into their creative processes in ways that caught your eye?</strong><br />
Photographer <a href="http://chiaragoia.com/">Chiara Goia</a> (<a href="https://instagram.com/chiaragoia/">@chiaragoia</a>) has been collecting fragments from her myriad travels and filing images along the way on Instagram. You may not know the destination, but your curiosity is sparked by her way of seeing. Photographer <a href="http://mattslaby.photoshelter.com/gallery-list">Matt Slaby</a> (<a href="https://instagram.com/mattslaby">@mattslaby</a>) regards Instagram as what he calls his “test kitchen” to float ideas and to plant seeds that may become projects. His gallery provides glimpses of works in progress ranging from one-offs to updated episodes of recurring themes.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: You mention Instagram being a rabbit hole of creativity; do you have any advice for photographers who are interested in getting the attention of the editorial staff?</strong><br />
It’s not an exact science. When we feature a community member on our channels, we always ask them who they follow on Instagram. Then you end up on the feeds of who they are following, who they in turn are discovering, and you’re suddenly down that rabbit hole. Also, the Explore tab is driven by engagement, so when photographers spark engagement from their audience, it expands the reach of their work. We use this powerful discovery tool just as everyone else. So it’s most meaningful and effective to focus on engaging with your personal audience: your friends, peers, fans, and the community of interest that grows around your work.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Looking through the photographers who are featured on the blog, it appears that most of them have followings in the tens of thousands. Is following a factor when you are choosing users to spotlight or work with for How I Shoot?</strong><br />
PC: We place a priority on highlighting unknown creative voices who haven’t had mainstream opportunities to share their work. So it’s not about how many followers someone has, and many of the community members we feature have very few followers when we first surface their work to the broader community.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: You've done a lot of work with professional photographers in your career. What have you enjoyed about working with a mixture of professionals and non-professionals?</strong><br />
PC: I began my career as a local newspaper photojournalist, where covering my hometown through pictures was my reason to exist. In my time at MediaStorm, Open Society Foundations, and most recently <em>National Geographic</em> magazine, I had the privilege of working with a tight-knit community of world-class photographers, editors, curators and producers on issue reporting and long-form documentary stories. Now I’ve learned that photography is important to even more people than I’d imagined. Visual literacy is being elevated every day. So many people are experiencing the same mind-blowing first steps that professionals went through when we first fell in love with photography: playing, learning, sharing, and building communities of shared interests. Their visual journey is just beginning.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Some in the professional photography community have worried that Instagram, and the rise in influence of hobbyist photographers, is making an already challenging industry even more difficult for professionals. What do you think of those concerns?</strong><br />
PC: Our industry has changed so much, and so quickly. Instagram is a place where a staggering number of people are cultivating a deeper appreciation for storytelling. Photographers can find themselves in the company of so many people who are paying attention to photography, and within this massive community there’s a new world of opportunity and challenge. Instagram is a place where you can build your own audience, present your creative growth to editors in real time, and discover others who are part of this evolving conversation.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<div><em><a href="http://www.ericgottesman.net/Sudden-Flowers---the-book/SUDDEN-FLOWERS---to-order/1/caption">Sudden Flowers</a></em>, a new book that offers a unique look at the lives of AIDS orphans in Africa, is the result of a 15-year collaboration between the Massachusetts-based artist <a href="http://www.ericgottesman.net/">Eric Gottesman</a> and a collective of children in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Gottesman worked with the children to create photographs, writing and recorded testimonies that reveal their personal experiences of losing parents to AIDS, and of overcoming homelessness, ostracism and depression. The collective gave themselves the name Sudden Flowers because, as one of them put it, “if given just a bit of light and water and care, we will suddenly blossom.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Horn of Africa has often been at the center of limited and frequently stereotypical depictions of Africa by western photographers—malnourished children beset by flies is a familiar trope. Ethiopia’s peculiar history with the camera, whereupon photography was banned or restricted for decades under authoritarian rule, weighed heavily in how Gottesman approached the <em>Sudden Flowers </em>collaboration.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Gottesman didn’t study photography in college, but he did take a course at <a href="http://documentarystudies.duke.edu/">Duke University’s Center for Documentary Studies</a>—taught by the acclaimed photographer <a href="http://alex-harris.com/">Alex Harris</a>. Gottesman graduated and, intending to go to law school, took a research position at the Supreme Court. He was working and living in Washington, D.C. when Harris encouraged him to apply for a new photography-related public policy fellowship. Intrigued by the possibilities, Gottesman considered the list of places the fellowship would be willing to send him and applied to work in Ethiopia because it was the one place that he knew the least about. He was selected, and arrived in Addis Ababa in 1999. Gottesman estimates he spent at least five of the next 15 years in the country. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>His fellowship was initially connected to <a href="http://www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.6115947/k.B143/Official_USA_Site.htm">Save the Children</a>, an NGO that, at the time, was trying to raise awareness of impending famine in Ethiopia’s Ogaden region. Gottesman was paired with a team of Ethiopian doctors who traveled about the desert evaluating nutrition levels in pastoralist communities. Gottesman’s job was simple: to take pictures that illustrated the direness of the situation. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“I was faced with this conundrum of having to point my camera at people who were desperate and starving [as part] of this whole process that would eventually benefit them,” he explains. “But that moment, standing in front of people with some of the least agency and power on earth and pointing my camera...it was very troubling.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The fact that those images would eventually help convince USAID to provide early funding for relief efforts in the Ogaden was small comfort for Gottesman. In his mind, if that was how the system was meant to work, there was something fundamentally wrong with the system. Once the assignment finished, Gottesman spent much of that first trip “hanging out”—meeting people and learning about the country. One of the people he met was Yawoinshet Masresha, an Ethiopian writer and youth activist who introduced him to the children who would become his “sudden flowers.” When he told Masresha of his interest in Ethiopia’s AIDS epidemic, she took him to a home she was renting for six orphans.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“The question for me [coming into this project] was, how do you get at the root of the problem with photography rather than using photography to visualize the symptoms,” he explains. In order to facilitate a truly collaborative effort, Gottesman decided that he needed to work with the same people over an extended period of time.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Gottesman explained his ideas to the children, outlining how he thought they could use photography to investigate their experiences. They listened politely, conferred amongst themselves and told him they would get back to him. A few days later they agreed to work with him, on the condition that the pictures be used to help other “children on the street.” The democratic spirit of the formation of the Sudden Flowers collective has remained a key part of the collaboration, with all of the children having a say in the process of creating and sharing the work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“[At first] the images were just snapshots and kids mugging for the camera but eventually there was one picture that was about a dream one of them had about the house burning down with her and her mother inside of it,” Gottesman says. “It was a double exposure where they took a picture of everyone running out of the house, then took a picture of the flames, and it created this really striking image. That’s when I realized that these kids understood the mechanics of the camera and the way that photographs can tell a story.”</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Over the course of 15 years, working with a group of children that expanded well beyond the initial six, Gottesman used a variety of methods in the project. Some images are reenactments of moments in the children’s lives inspired by thought experiments the photographer posed to the group. At one point Gottesman provided the Sudden Flowers collective with tape recorders and encouraged them to record themselves talking in private about their parents. Another assignment was for the children to write letters to the parents they had lost. “They missed their parents hugging them or buying them ice cream. It wasn’t about the kinds of things that NGOs, on their behalf, thought they needed, like food and shelter,” Gottesman remembers. The letters and transcripts are a vital part of <em>Sudden Flowers</em>, the text facilitating a dialogue between the words and images, the past and present, and at times, between the children and Gottesman himself. The media also changed; film turned to digital, black-and-white to color, still images to video. Polaroids proved especially effective, their cost forcing everyone to slow down and carefully consider every shot, while also providing instant gratification in the form of an object the children could hold. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>The initial aims of the Sudden Flowers collective were focused on building awareness inside Ethiopia through traveling public exhibits. But Gottesman had long harbored ideas of producing a photobook as well. During years of making mixed-media exhibitions, the children edited the work as they went along, and provided a template for incorporating text. “In 2008 I started working with a designer who helped me put some stuff together, and that was incredibly helpful in starting to conceptualize what the final object might look like,” Gottesman explains. He took drafts of the book to the children in Ethiopia and came back home with all their notes, then returned again to Addis Ababa with a new draft. As a final touch, the children created a thousand handcrafted letters, one for each copy of the book. A fitting addendum to a project that sought to give voice and agency to those who are traditionally subject to the Western lens.</div>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Rugged mountains, sapphire lakes; athletes climbing, jumping and pushing themselves to the limit. The best action-sports imagery captures the thrill and spontaneity of outdoor adventure. For companies like <a href="http://www.patagonia.com/us/home">Patagonia</a>, <a href="http://www.eddiebauer.com/">Eddie Bauer</a> and <a href="http://www.smithoptics.com/">Smith Optics</a>, images like these are an essential part of a brand marketing strategy. Companies need photographs that stir excitement around outdoor sports, even if the images don’t explicitly sell the brands’ products.  
<p>If you’re a photographer of outdoor adventure—especially if you enjoy participating in these pursuits— this need presents a great opportunity. But how do you break into the industry? What are art directors looking for? Most important, how do you get invited to document the best trips?</p>
<p><strong>Defining a Need</strong></p>
<p>“To me, authentic storytelling is the best brand marketing,” says Jane Sievert, director of photography at Patagonia. “We’re far more interested in the spirit of the photo than if the person is wearing our latest style or the logo is apparent.”</p>
<p>“We use photographs to connect all our touch points,” says Chatham Baker, creative director at Smith Optics, which makes high-performance sunglasses, goggles and helmets. “We want world-class, authentic imagery in print and digital ads, point-of-sale, catalogues, websites and social media.” </p>
<p>The key to attracting attention on all these platforms is keeping the images real. </p>
<p>Caley George, who manages expedition photography for Eddie Bauer, says he takes notice of “how a photographer is using landscapes, light and shadow, and whether a product is featured well.” However, he says, all these elements must be held together by a natural-looking, editorial style. </p>
<p>Likewise, Smith Optics’ Baker says he’s looking for photographs “that are almost journalistic—[that] capture genuine, amazing moments.” <a href="http://talroberts.com/">Tal Roberts</a>, who has shot a variety of sports for Smith Optics, says assignments following sponsored athletes in the outdoors require him to document “the whole experience of what they’re doing. A lot of the stuff that Smith runs is in-the-moment stuff, where you get the feeling of being there in the situation.”</p>
<p><strong>Breaking In</strong></p>
<p>For the most part, photographers who work with top outdoor brands love outdoor sports—and for many, this led them into photographing professionally. </p>
<p>“I’m a snowboarder, skateboarder and mountain biker,” says Roberts, who shoots all three. Initially, Roberts started photographing because he wanted to capture peak moments in skateboarding. “I’d say to people, ‘Hey, that trick you just did was awesome, do you want to get a photo of it?’” Eventually he had a portfolio of images that appealed to Smith Optics, which gave him his first big break. </p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="http://garrettgrove.com/">Garrett Grove</a> started taking photographs to document his own skiing and climbing trips, afterward posting images online for friends and family. In 2007, he caught a lucky break when the marketing director of <a href="http://www.neckykayaks.com/region_select/">Necky Kayaks</a> saw his blog and asked Grove to do a shoot. He now shoots for Patagonia, Black Diamond and Eddie Bauer, among others.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.markwelshphoto.com/">Mark Welsh</a>, an avid snowboarder, got to know his fellow snowboarders, and through them met sponsors. He now travels internationally with top athletes, and is praised as “a photographic badass” by Baker, with whom he often works. “My best friends are snowboarders and surfers,” Welsh says. “When I leave to go on a job, it’s more like I’m going on vacation.”</p>
<p>All three photographers say it’s crucial to know the sport you’re photographing, for safety reasons and in order to position yourself correctly. “That’s 100-percent crucial,” says Roberts. “This is not something you just walk into.” </p>
<p>Photographers shooting sponsored trips have to be able to switch between covering the action and looking out for images that present the sponsor’s brand well. While a catalogue shoot is typically art directed, with a defined shot list, most of the work Grove does for sponsors has to be shot like “editorial stories,” he says. “I guess about 70 to 80 percent of the time you’re just going with the flow, shooting from the hip; 20 to 30 percent of the time you’ll see a moment that fits with [the clients’] branding, then you’ll set it up [again] and make sure it works.” </p>
<p>Welsh says, “My approach is to shoot as much as I can and always have my camera out shooting, so I can get everything.” That includes both environmental shots and close-ups on interactions between the athletes, and everything in between. He explains, “On a five-day trip, I’ll shoot 15,000 to 18,000 photos.”</p>
<p><strong>Know Your Athletes</strong></p>
<p>Photographers and sponsors suggest that anyone who wants to get into the field should befriend athletes. Leading athletes are “sponsored from head-to-toe,” Grove says, and sponsors often underwrite their expeditions. If a photographer teams up with an athlete (or group of athletes), chances are the sponsor will hire a photographer based on the athlete’s recommendation.  </p>
<p>“I ask athletes if they have a preferred photographer or videographer; about half of them do,” says Eddie Bauer’s George, who fields around 70 trip proposals from athletes a year, and funds ten. “I’m always eager to hear what they think, because they know as much as I do.”</p>
<p>At Patagonia, Sievert says she almost always lets athletes select the photographers they feel safe working with. “I never want to micro-manage who’s included on an expedition, both for safety reasons and in order to help create the best vibe for our athletes when they’re out in the field.” </p>
<p>Grove says that at least 60 percent of his work comes from planning trips with athletes, and then pitching his ideas to sponsors. He first met professional athletes while skiing Mount Baker in Washington, and was able to self-fund trips and sell images afterward, each trip paying for the next, until his portfolio and reputation were strong enough to get him commissions. </p>
<p>Roberts and Welsh have similar stories. Welsh has worked with professional snowboarders Bryan Fox, Austin Smith and Shaun McKay. Roberts often works with professional snowboarder Chase Josey, and the two might go out on a shoot with or without advance funding. When <em>PDN</em> spoke to Roberts, he was in the mountains in Stanley, Idaho, building a snow ramp to a colorful jungle gym that Josey was about to board off. “Since this wasn’t shot while on an assignment, I’ll be sending the image around to companies who sponsor Chase, such as Capita Snowboards and Smith Optics, as well as snowboarding magazines,” says Roberts.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing Your Work</strong></p>
<p>Because of the importance of word-of-mouth, promotional materials from photographers tend to be less valuable than in other types of advertising. Roberts, Welsh and Grove say they almost never send out printed promos, though they may assemble digital portfolios when they pitch an idea to a particular client. </p>
<p>Sievert and Baker say they actively dislike receiving promo materials from photographers. “Maybe it works for other people, but I prefer word of mouth, friends of friends, phone calls or even chance meetings,” says Baker. Sievert adds, “It pains me to receive slick promotional materials on non-recycled paper that simply get tossed into the recycle bin.” </p>
<p>George differs a little, estimating that he hires 60 percent of his photographers based on existing connections, and 40 percent based on photographers’ marketing efforts. He attends major trade shows each year in Salt Lake City and Denver, where he’ll set up meetings; he also looks at social media. “You meet people or see their work,” he says. “You may not use them for a couple of years, then suddenly it’s the right time.” </p>
<p>Though adventure sports is a competitive field, there’s still room for emerging photographers, say Sievert and George. “If you’re new, try to get someone to say, ‘I know this guy, his work is great and he’s looking for a break,’” says George. “No one wants to [send] a shoot out the door on a bit of a gamble.”</p>
<p>“Produce good work; Have athletes that want to work with you,” advises Roberts. “See if you can step your technique up a bit in order to stand out.” </p>
<p>But—bottom line—love what you do, says Welsh. “Bear in mind that you won’t make the kind of money you could make in fashion photography—you’re doing it because you love the sport,” he says. “Know that first, and stick with it.”</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[To U.S. and European media audiences, Kirkuk is an oil-rich, war-torn city, previously occupied by the U.S. military and now a tense, violent hot spot in the war between the Kurdish security forces and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). But to photojournalist <a href="http://photographyhawre.weebly.com/index.html">Hawre Khalid</a>, Kirkuk is home, and a place where most people are just trying to go about their daily lives in peace with their neighbors, despite its complicated history and politics.
<p>“It is difficult to understand if you are not part of it, if you are not inside it,” Khalid explained in an email interview. To help provide outsiders with a better understanding, Khalid returned in 2014 after four years in Europe to work on a project called <a href="http://roadsandkingdoms.com/2014/my-kirkuk/">“My Kirkuk,”</a> which was published in late October by Roads &amp; Kingdoms, the online magazine of travel and culture.</p>
<p>Pauline Eiferman, the magazine’s associate editor and photo director, came across the project after a summer meeting at <a href="http://www.visapourlimage.com/index.do;jsessionid=t8O+IBbNUnN7a9dgxAC-hOA2">Visa Pour l’Image Perpignan 2014</a> with Stefano Carini, editor-in-chief of <a href="http://metrography.photoshelter.com/">the Iraqi photo agency Metrography</a>. Eiferman ended up doing a story about the agency, which represents Khalid. His work in particular caught her eye, and she contacted him about doing a separate story for Roads &amp; Kingdoms featuring his Kirkuk work.</p>
<p>“I came up with the name ‘My Kirkuk’ for the story because that’s what I liked most about Hawre’s work: the fact that it was so personal,” Eiferman told <em>PDN</em> via email. She’d seen work about Kurdistan by other photographers. “But the fact that Hawre was photographing his hometown gave his work incredible depth…I believe it’s also extremely important to get the story from local journalists and photographers.”</p>
<p>Khalid had covered Kirkuk as a freelance news photographer from 2007 until 2010, when he was forced to leave in a hurry. He had written a newspaper column about attitudes toward sex in Kurdistan, and Kurdish mullahs responded by making death threats against him during Friday prayers, Khalid says. He fled to the Netherlands, and stayed for four years. </p>
<p>Although he was glad for the opportunity to experience another culture, he frequently felt the pull of home, and he wanted for Kirkuk what surprised him most in the Netherlands: people living in peace in a beautiful country.</p>
<p>“I wanted to be with my people, and I wanted to make a change [there],” he says. “The people of Kirkuk want to live their lives. Many don’t care about religion or [ethnicity] or politics.” </p>
<p>His intent was to hold up a mirror for the people of Kirkuk. “I feel that they are too close to the situation to see it properly,” he says. But he also wanted to help outside audiences understand the aspirations, culture and history of the people of Kirkuk, and see beyond the region’s oil resources.</p>
<p>“I want to say to [outsiders], ‘If you can’t help the people of Kirkuk, then leave them alone,’” Khalid says. “If you do care, invest in education. Don’t just bring your oil rigs. Bring liberal, modern ideas and invest in the people.”</p>
<p>When he returned from the Netherlands, Khalid found Kirkuk “even worse than before” he had left. The city’s infrastructure is crumbling. Unemployment is high, and many people struggle to get enough to eat. Making the situation even worse is the Kurdish war against ISIS. Random terrorist bombings are frequent, and Kirkuk residents risk their lives by leaving their houses to buy food or visit friends.</p>
<p>The story he had in mind before returning “got bigger and got a different angle” because of the hardship and conflict, he says. It became a story about how people in a war zone hold onto a sense of normalcy while trying to survive. Khalid’s approach was to walk the city streets, and talk to people he met “about their life, about their families,” he explains. “Everywhere I go there is something interesting, sad or beautiful” to explore and photograph.</p>
<p>His subjects are predominantly men in public places: smoking and drinking tea at a cafe, playing pool at a bazaar, watching a World Cup soccer match (Germany vs. Brazil) at a cafe in a Kirkuk park.</p>
<p>“Everybody was totally engaged in the game,” Khalid says of the image of the soccer fans in the cafe. “In Kirkuk there are many explosions, especially at busy places, like this cafe. But people were not afraid. They live their life without thinking what can happen to them. They are tired of thinking about that, of having their lives surrounded by violence.”</p>
<p>Another image shows a refugee family from Mosul, taking shelter from the midday sun under a billboard advertising food. “They left everything behind,” Khalid says. “When I asked them how they get money to buy food, the father told us they only eat once every two days.”</p>
<p>Yet another subject, a 22-year-old soccer player and actress, allowed Khalid to photograph her in public as well as at home. She stands out as a liberated, Western-leaning, middle-class woman making a life for herself amid the privation and male-dominated culture of Kirkuk. </p>
<p>Khalid says it was a challenge getting his subjects to open up because of a general mistrust of journalists. “Many journalists in the Iraqi media lie to the people” in order to get stories, Khalid says. People also fear repercussions from the authorities for anything they might say to journalists. </p>
<p>Khalid also had difficulty working around local authorities, who are often in conflict with one another. “For example, police and Asaish (Kurdish security forces): When you get permission from one of them to work the city, the other will refuse to recognize the permission,” he says.</p>
<p>Through contacts in both organizations, Khalid was eventually able to resolve those bureaucratic conflicts. And by explaining that he was a freelancer working for international media, and telling potential subjects that he was interested not in politics, but how they lived their daily lives, wary subjects were willing to give him a chance. “After spending some time with them I gain their trust,” Khalid says.</p>
<p>He shot with minimal gear: two Canon camera bodies (a EOS 60D and 5D Mark II) and two lenses (a 24-105mm f/4L zoom and a 50mm prime). He had help editing his work from Carini, the Metrography editor-in-chief. Carini sent 25 images to Roads &amp; Kingdoms, from which Eiferman selected 15.</p>
<p>“Hawre and I then worked together on an introduction to the piece. It was crucial for me to get his voice in the writing as much as it was in his photographs,” Eiferman says.</p>
<p>Khalid says he plans to continue working on the Kirkuk project, documenting the city as it changes. “I will focus more on street photography and I will try to be much closer to people. I have a plan to show the difference between the rich and poor people,” he says. Eventually, he’d like to publish a book, and exhibit the work in the U.S., because Americans know Kirkuk only through the lens of a decade-long war, he says. “They haven’t seen the real Kirkuk.”</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[&nbsp;Most of the time, photographers spend at most a few days, weeks, or months on a story. But sometimes, photographers are so drawn in by a subject or an issue, that they end up pursuing a project for years. They are often able to document stories with unusual depth, intimacy and nuance because they earn a lot of access, and come to know their subjects well. &nbsp;For instance, Joseph Sywenkyj, who has spent 15 years documenting a Ukrainian family struggling with the consequences of HIV infection, says, "I have spent so much time that I am practically a family member. There is a lot of trust and history between us."
<p>Funding such long-term projects, however, takes ingenuity and hard work. Here are several stories from past issues of PDN that highlight noteworthy documentary projects that photographers have pursued over long periods of time. The stories explore a range of issues, including the photographers' motivations and production challenges, and the creative ways they fund and distribute stories that continue long past the attention span of most media outlets.

    <article_text><![CDATA[In discussing his seminal series “American Surfaces,” the photographer <a href="http://stephenshore.net/">Stephen Shore</a> has described thinking of “photography as a technical means of communicating what the world looks like if you see it in a state of heightened awareness.” As he traveled through the United States, Shore was making photographs of landscapes and details that most would overlook, using the camera to assign them significance.
<p>A similar state of heightened awareness is evident in the work of <a href="http://www.jennileemarigomen.com/">Jennilee Marigomen</a>, a Vancouver-based photographer whose <a href="http://new-documents.org/books/window-seat">second book,</a> <em><a href="http://new-documents.org/books/window-seat">Window Seat</a></em><a href="http://new-documents.org/books/window-seat">,</a> was published last year by New Documents. Marigomen, who won the Magenta Foundation’s Flash Forward Emerging Photographer award in 2011, is part of the lineage of photographers who create art from everyday scenes. In <em>Window Seat</em>, Marigomen combines careful use of light, shadow and color with sensitive—at times playful—observation to show viewers a world flush with beauty and wonder, for those who care to open themselves to it. She created this particular body of work during a trip to Mexico, but it is less about a specific place than about a way of seeing and appreciating the world.</p>
<p>Emotion plays an important role in Marigomen’s process. “Every photo that I take reflects something that I feel or that I felt,” she says. “A lonely waste bin or a folded up umbrella leaning on the wall after it’s been used in the market—I can sympathize with these objects.” </p>
<p>While emotional awareness influences how she sees, Marigomen tries to maintain her distance. Her work is “about quietly observing things around me and trying not to disturb what is there,” she says. The book’s title references the metaphor of photography as a window, but windows are also barriers that imply separateness and remove—when we look through windows we see the world, but are not necessarily in it.</p>
<p>In one of Marigomen’s images, cracks in a sidewalk caused by growing tree roots play with dappled sunlight and strewn magenta flower petals. A pair of images shows masses of potted plants decorating doorsteps. A bushy, black dog sleeps in a shadow under the rear bumper of a parked car. A small house with a thatched roof, which looks like it was built and added to in several stages, sits at the end of a dirt driveway, surrounded by green hills.</p>
<p>Throughout the book, light and shadow contribute to the graphic beauty of the images, which she made using an old Nikon F90x and Kodak Portra film. The changing light in Marigomen’s native Vancouver, and the rain there, which “is always washing things away,” influence her work. “In some ways, I am chasing the ephemeral: reflections, shadows, rainbows, nature arranged strangely. I don’t take them for granted, and think of them as gifts,” she says.</p>
<p>People play a subtle role in Marigomen’s book. They are represented primarily by the environments they’ve created, which, Marigomen notes, have a do-it-yourself quality—a stack of cinder blocks holding an umbrella steady, or plastic chairs hung creatively from a hot dog stand for easy transport. When people do appear in the images, they are seen at a distance, or their faces are obscured, which makes them “replaceable with anyone,” Marigomen notes. The photographs aren’t about individuals, they are about “everything around them.”</p>
<p>Marigomen edited the work with New Documents publisher Jeff Khonsary, whom she met at an artist talk he organized a few years ago. The pair stayed in touch, and he approached her about creating a book in 2013. Khonsary’s input and the passage of time helped Marigomen edit the work, which she had made in 2011. It “took away my emotional attachment to the moment or the photo,” she says. “Forgetting exactly what happened in that moment, or what made that special to me when I took it,” helped her focus on the formal qualities of the images and the sequence.</p>
<p>In editing the book, Marigomen says, she “wanted people to see how the awareness of the smallest, everyday gestures in the smallest detail can be just as fulfilling as something with a direct study or commentary.”</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<strong>Client: </strong><em><a href="http://www.wired.com/">WIRED</a></em>
<p><strong>Photo Editors: </strong>Paloma Shutes and Julia Sabot</p>
<p>In his personal work, photographer <a href="http://www.justinfantl.com/">Justin Fantl</a> often constructs studies of shapes and colors. The editorial and commercial clients who hire him to shoot still lifes of everything from clothes to sleek, high-tech gadgets have described his style as “clean,” “graphic,” “playful,” “cheeky” and “surreal,” he says. On a recent assignment for the <a href="http://www.wired.com/design-life-2014/">2014</a> <em><a href="http://www.wired.com/design-life-2014/">WIRED</a></em><a href="http://www.wired.com/design-life-2014/">: Design Life</a> special issue, Fantl applied his crisp lighting and eye for color to a series of complicated product shots, photographed on a grand scale. <em>WIRED</em> photo editor Paloma Shutes told Fantl they needed eight spreads that would serve as openers to each feature article, plus a cover. Fantl had previously shot smaller assignments for <em>WIRED</em>, but this assignment would stretch over the course of four days, giving him “more time and luxury to play around,” he says. </p>
<p>Working at Blast Studio in San Francisco, he had space to lay out a wide selection of props, showing their use in the course of an ordinary day—from exercise to work to dining at home.</p>
<p>“I have quite a bit of experience with lay-downs,” Fantl says. What made this shoot difference was the scale of the arrangements of objects he would be shooting. His image of a dinner table laden with food, glassware, plates and silverware, for example, was shot on seamless measuring roughly 9 x 20 feet.</p>
<p>“It was a very hands-on collaborative process. We had a food stylist, a stylist, myself, my assistant, a designer and two photo editors all working to put the table together,” Fantl explains. </p>
<p>Fantl says he likes the crisp shadows he creates with continuous lights—and his clients do, too. To maintain a consistent look in all the photos for <em>WIRED</em>, he set up the key light and fill lights for his first photo, then made only small adjustments for all the other photos. </p>
<p>To show that these were objects that people live with and interact with, the photo editors wanted to add an element of life to some of the photos. In one shot, <em>WIRED</em> photo editor Julia Sabot served as a model, striking a yoga pose on a yoga mat along with weights, a balance ball, gym bag and other props. A well-behaved dog belonging to <em>WIRED </em>editor Scott Dadich made an appearance in another shot. For the shot of the dinner table, the photo editors suggested placing a cat in the scene. To capture the cat as it dashed through the set, the photographer had to bring in an additional light in order to freeze the motion of the skittish creature.</p>
<p><strong>Logistics</strong></p>
<p>Before the shoot began, Fantl and Shutes came up with a plan for shooting a maximum number of props and a schedule for capturing each scenario, so that during the shoot they would be able to focus on arranging the objects. “We knew that we wanted to be clear about what we were going after and what we wanted to do,” he says. Art director Claudia de Almeida had designed numbers that would be incorporated into each image, to indicate the time of day that the props would be used: The layouts called for the numbers to appear under the lay-downs, and the team discussed making the numbers out of cardboard or wood and placing them on the floor. Fantl says that while he prefers capturing every element of a composition in camera, he proposed adding the numbers in postproduction, “because I knew it would give us more flexibility” to create interesting arrangements. </p>
<p>While shooting each scenario, they overlaid the number on the monitor using Phocus software, so that as they arranged each composition, they could see how the props worked with the colors and shapes of the numbers. “The process felt like live graphic design in a way,” Fantl says. </p>
<p><strong>Lighting</strong></p>
<p>Fantl says he began using Mole Richardson 1K and 2K tungsten lights while working in a variety of rental studios. “In many studios there is usually a deep, dark closet, and on a shelf in the abyss you can often find a worn and battered stage light,” he explains. He gave them a try, “and began using them more and more.” He says when he shows clients tests shot with the tungsten lights and with strobes, they often choose the tungsten. “I find that the shadows are a bit crisper and the quality of light is somehow different from strobes,” he notes.</p>
<p>On the <em>WIRED</em> shoot, he says: “We had a half day to figure out the lighting and we used it.” Once he set up his lights for the first shot, he would use a nearly identical setup for each of the shots. </p>
<p>He first put his primary key light, a Mole Richardson 2K tungsten on a boom hanging over the center of the set. Next, he set up walls of V-flats around the set. Inside the V-flats, he set up four 2K Mole Richardsons on light stands. “The lights were pointed away from the subject and bouncing light into the V-flats,” Fantl says. “So a more even, soft light was bouncing back onto the set.” </p>
<p>This bounced light worked, he says, “to create fill as well as highlights.” Depending on where he wanted the shadows to fall in each scenario, he could adjust the light stands and V-flats. </p>
<p>Once the table was in place, but before it was set, Fantl needed to capture a shot of the cat, which could later be composited into the final shot. “One problem with continuous light [is that] you can’t freeze motion all that well,” the photographer notes. “We had to rig up a strobe next to the continuous key light in order to capture the cat without motion blur.” He had a Profoto head with a Magnum reflector placed near the key light on the boom. </p>
<p>He notes, “The cat was a little freaked out by being in the studio, so basically as soon as we put him down, he took off like a rocket to hide. We didn’t want to stress him out so we only put him down a few times and got one or two options.” After the cat was back in his crate and on his way home, the stylists began setting the table with placemats, glasses, tableware and food for the final shot. </p>
<p><strong>Camera</strong></p>
<p>Fantl fixed a Hasselblad H5D-50c to a scissor lift, then hoisted it to about 30 feet above the floor. He used a 35mm lens at f/16. The relatively wide lens served two purposes, Fantl says. “In order to get the whole area, we needed the wider focal length, and with the wider lens, you start to see the sides of objects,” even with the camera pointed straight down. “If you could only see the tops of the objects, it would be harder to tell what they are.” Fantl says he shot most of the images at 1/4 to 1/3 sec, but to capture the image of the running cat, he shot at 1/500 sec. </p>
<p>Though he shot tethered, Fantl climbed up the scissor lift to look over the set as the compositions came together. “There was a lot of going up and down,” he recalls. “It was fun for me to go up there, and ponder the game plan.” </p>
<p><strong>Postproduction</strong></p>
<p>Fantl estimates that setting up and shooting the tabletop image took about four hours from start to finish. He and the photo editors previewed each image, tweaking the arrangement of objects and lights as they went. Fantl did some color correction and made some sharpening adjustments to the selected images on the spot. Then he saved the native Hasselblad RAW files as high-res TIFF files and JPEGs to a hard drive. The team at <em>WIRED</em> handled the compositing of the numbers and the final shots. “It can be hard to just turn your images over to someone else to work on,” Fantl says, “but I am fortunate that most of my esthetic comes from my lighting.”</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[If you were wondering why <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1078001-REG/gopro_chdhx_401_hero4_black_edition_adventure.html/BI/1282/KBID/1657/kw/GOH4AB/DFF/d10-v2-t1-xGOH4AB">GoPro</a>’s stock price skyrocketed after its IPO, listen to cinematographers like <a href="https://www.hurlbutvisuals.com/blog/">Shane Hurlbut</a> or <a href="http://www.tobyoliver.com/">Toby Oliver</a> as they recount with barely disguised glee what they’ve put these action cameras through. They’ve plowed them into asphalt and rock, sent cars and trucks barreling into them at high speeds and—for the coup de gr&acirc;ce—melted them down in firestorms while still retrieving usable memory cards from the charred husks. 
<p>That most users of <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1078001-REG/gopro_chdhx_401_hero4_black_edition_adventure.html/BI/1282/KBID/1657/kw/GOH4AB/DFF/d10-v2-t1-xGOH4AB">GoPros</a> and other action cameras put their gear on a path of destruction has kept production lines humming. It’s also created a whole new era of point-of-view filmmaking, in which action cams are being increasingly pressed into service as the “disposable” camera of choice for productions large and small. </p>
<p>At the same time, action camera footage has made a leap from small screens to silver screens. </p>
<p>Todd Jones, co-founder of the action sports media company <a href="http://www.tetongravity.com/">Teton Gravity Research</a>, was an early adopter of action cameras. He prizes them for the ease with which he could mount them to goggles, helmets and high-flying athletes to capture point-of-view images that the production team simply couldn’t engineer, even with a helicopter and RED Epics. Back when action cameras produced standard-definition video and the quality “was so noticeably awful,” they were used sparingly, he says. Today, in films like <em><a href="http://www.tetongravity.com/films/jeremy-jones-higher">Jeremy Jones’ Higher</a></em>, action-camera footage can comprise almost 20 percent of the movie.</p>
<p>For all the gains that action cameras have made in the past several years, it’s still a challenge to integrate them into productions that use other cameras. Relative to cinema cameras or DSLRs, action cameras have miniscule image sensors and very limited control over exposure settings. Their wide-angle, often fish-eye lenses provide a noticeably different field-of-view that can be all the more jarring when blended with footage from more traditional cinema focal lengths. But according to the cinematographers we spoke with, there are several ways to mitigate these deficiencies and exploit action cameras to their fullest potential.</p>
<p><strong>Planning Makes Perfect</strong></p>
<p>For Jones, the first step in securing usable action-camera footage is ensuring that the athletes they work with are fully trained on the cameras they’ll be wearing. Teton Gravity Research uses <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1022318-REG/sony_hdr_as100v_w_hdr_as100v_pov_action_camcorder.html/BI/1282/KBID/1657/kw/SOHDRAS100V/DFF/d10-v2-t1-xSOHDRAS100V">Sony action cams</a>—which Jones chose for their audio quality, sleek physical profile and contoured fit when mounted to goggles or helmets—and the company’s daredevils know they have an important role to play in securing great point-of-view footage. “We encourage them to think like camera [operators],” he says. “They know if we’re not around and they see something cool unfolding in front of them, that they have a camera… and can get the shot.” The athletes, he adds, have really embraced this dual role.</p>
<p>In instances where there’s no human operator or chance of human intervention, such as when Oliver and Hurlbut mounted GoPros to cars fated for fiery crash scenes, redundancy is the watchword. Mounting multiple action cameras ups the odds that some useable footage can be salvaged from the wreckage. It also ensures a wider range of camera angles. In <em><a href="http://www.needforspeed.com/movie">Need for Speed</a></em>, Hurlbut outfitted a replica of a Koenigsegg Agera race car with multiple GoPros and one was able to capture the view from the bottom of the car as it flipped over in the air above another vehicle. All the GoPro hardware and mounts Hurlbut used in <em>Need for Speed</em>, he says, were purchased at a chain electronics store.</p>
<p>And while action cameras are treated as “disposable” in the context of Hollywood budgets, they’re remarkably hard to dispose of. “We put GoPros in situations where I thought they would have a 30 percent survival rate, but it turned out to be closer to 80 percent,” Hurlbut says. </p>
<p>To film a truck crash in <em><a href="http://www.wolfcreek2.com.au/">Wolf Creek 2</a></em>, Oliver outfitted the plunging truck with six GoPros while deploying five on the ground to record the impact head-on. As Oliver recalls, eight emerged from the carnage, including the aforementioned GoPro that melted in the heat while still preserving its memory card. “But we captured a truly extraordinary shot that was used in the trailer, of the truck landing on top of the camera and blowing up.”</p>
<p><strong>Set and Forget</strong></p>
<p>Whether the action cam is on a suicide mission or bound to an athlete attempting a death-defying stunt, there’s no chance for a do-over or mid-course corrections. Action cameras typically offer minimal control over exposure, so you have to put your faith in the camera’s Auto mode, Hurlbut says, and hope for the best. </p>
<p>Beyond blind faith, both Hurlbut and Oliver had some GoPro-specific approaches that helped them in their respective films. Both used the Hero3+ Black Edition camera and took advantage of GoPro’s Protune controls, which lets you adjust white balance, ISO limit, sharpness and exposure compensation before filming. The only significant adjustment they made was to Protune’s color profile, setting it to flat, which is a neutral color profile that captures more details in shadows and highlights and can be color-corrected to better blend with footage from other cameras.</p>
<p>Both Hurlbut and Oliver set their GoPros to record at 2.7K resolution at 24 fps to better match the main camera’s resolution. “We looked at recording at 1080p and 48 fps but at that resolution it didn’t hold up as well,” Oliver says, though they were able to use some 1080p footage at 60 fps.</p>
<p>Another simple tweak Oliver employed was the use of <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1014999-REG/polar_pro_p1004_neutral_density_for_motorsports.html/BI/1282/KBID/1657/kw/POP1004/DFF/d10-v2-t1-xPOP1004">ND filters</a>. “The way GoPro controls exposure is with shutter speed and if you’re in bright sunlight, it will respond by speeding up the shutter which can give you a staccato look.” In digital cinema, Oliver noted, you tend to set a shutter speed for the whole movie, but the GoPro’s shutter is “all over the place.” </p>
<p>ND filters hit the brakes on this rapid shutter movement while the crew filmed <em>Wolf Creek 2 </em>on the sun-drenched plains of the Australian Outback.</p>
<p><strong>Post Patch Up</strong></p>
<p>Critical to any smooth integration of action camera footage is effective postprocessing. </p>
<p>In <em>Need for Speed,</em> Hurlbut worked with GoPro to expand the dynamic range of the Hero3 so while he was recording in 2.7K at 24 fps, he had a RAW file with more dynamic range than the Hero3 typically produces.  </p>
<p>To reduce the noise and blend the GoPro scenes with those shot on the other cameras used in the film, the footage was run through Cinnafilm’s Dark Energy, a $199 plug-in for Adobe After Effects. The plug-in not only reduces noise and film grain in individual clips, but also works to ensure noise and film grain consistency across multiple video sources. <em>Need for Speed </em>blended files from a total of four cameras in Dark Energy: The Arri Alexa, a <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/855975-REG/Canon_EOS_C500_Cinema_EOS.html/BI/1282/KBID/1657/kw/CAC500EF/DFF/d10-v2-t1-xCAC500EF">Canon EOS C500</a>, a <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/855962-REG/Canon_EOS_1D_C_EOS_1D_C_4K_Cinema.html/BI/1282/KBID/1657/kw/CAE1DC/DFF/d10-v2-t1-xCAE1DC">Canon EOS-1D C</a> and GoPros.</p>
<p>Oliver also sees the new Hero4’s faster 4K frame rates as providing another opportunity to work around the GoPro’s limitations in postproduction—the distortions at the edge of the frame due to the camera’s wide angle lens. “If you have a 4K file in post you can zoom in to find a tighter frame and lose the fish-eye feel” without sacrificing resolution, he says. </p>
<p>Even the best edit may not camouflage the action cam, and for some scenes, the solution is to keep the cuts short. “It’s not ideal,” Oliver admits, but it’s often a choice of that “GoPro look” or nothing at all. </p>
<p>Besides, Hurlbut says, people shouldn’t get too caught up with quality concerns. Using action cameras isn’t about pristine image quality but about immersing the audience in thrilling experiences. “That emotion,” Hurlbut says, “you can’t get with any other camera.”</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Photographer <a href="http://www.chrisburkard.com/">Chris Burkard</a>, whom we profiled in <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/Chris-Burkard-From-Transworld-Surf-to-Apple-and-Microsoft-12627.shtml">“5 Routes to Success in Sports and Adventure Photography,"</a> established his personal style by focusing on the landscapes that surround sports like surfing and snowboarding. Working early in his career as an editorial photographer, he says he learned that, “If you really want to create something that’s timeless, something that allows the viewer to be in that moment, you have to show the landscape.” 
<p>Burkard’s attention to capturing a sense of place was influenced in part by <a href="http://fatali.com/">Michael Fatali</a>, a photographer who works with an 8x10 camera to create fine-art images of remote locations. As a young photographer, Burkard studied with Fatali for a couple of months, and learned key lessons from the large-format landscape photographer’s process.</p>
<p>“His work and the patience it takes to get his work really made an impression on me,” Burkard says. Fatali would spend hours hiking into remote canyons or other locations with his 8x10, Burkard says, and would make only a small number of exposures once there. “His approach was always, when you come to a place, the last thing you want to do is just grab your camera,” Burkard explains. Instead, “you absorb the experience. You look at every angle. You get down on your belly and you go up high and you just look at everything—you try to educate yourself on [the place], and then you wait for the right light and when that moment comes, you know.” </p>
<p>While Burkard appears to work in a vastly different field of photography, he’s adapted Fatali’s approach to his work. “Traveling, I don’t aim to go to places and pull out my camera and just start blasting away sequences,” he says. “I want to know a place and remember what it felt like, and all those attributes that make traveling so great. For me, it’s been a really fine mixture of being educated on a location before I go, but also leaving myself open to new experiences as they arise so I can capture stuff that’s in the moment.”</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[For nearly six decades, <a href="http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&amp;VF=MAGO31_10_VForm&amp;ERID=24KL535C7T">Josef Koudelka</a> has focused an empathetic eye on the human condition. An exhibition at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, <a href="http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/koudelka/">“Josef Koudelka: Nationality Doubtful,”</a> presents a sweeping overview of his work, including poignant photographs of Roma (Gypsies), electrifying documents of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, and massive panoramas of conflict-altered landscapes, most recently from his book Wall, on the barrier separating Israel and the West Bank. 
<p>As the exhibition title suggests, statelessness, perpetual travel and exile have characterized Koudelka’s life and work. One of his most famous projects focuses on nomadic people—the Roma—and he produced his book Exiles during his own years of rootless wandering in the United States and Europe, before he was granted French citizenship in 1987.</p>
<p>He spoke in November to the the Getty Museum’s Laura Hubber and Annelisa Stephan, during the final moments of preparation for the exhibition, which runs through March 22, 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Laura Hubber: You’re famous for not taking assignments. How do you choose your subjects?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Josef Koudelka: </strong>I know what I want to do and I do it. And I’ve created conditions so I can do it—I’ve been doing it for 45 years. People who do assignments are being paid and they are supposed to do something. I want to keep the freedom not to do anything, the freedom to change everything.</p>
<p><strong>LH: What’s the main motivation for you to choose a subject?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JK:</strong> I’m an intuitive person.  </p>
<p><strong>LH: If it speaks to you, you go.</strong></p>
<p><strong>JK: </strong>You know, people ask all the time why I photographed gypsies. I’ve never known. I’m not particularly interested to know.</p>
<p><strong>LH: Is it possible that you were drawn to the way Roma are free from the state? </strong></p>
<p><strong>JK: </strong>No, not at all [pause]. You know, I didn’t grow up with American cinema like many photographers. I was from a little village. I was never fascinated by the United States. But I remember seeing photographs from the Farm Security Administration and they moved me very much. It wasn’t because of the style of the photography—it was because of the subject. Maybe you’ll find something similar with Gypsies too.</p>
<p><strong>Annelisa Stephan: You’ve talked about having “the eye.” What does that mean?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JK:</strong> When you look at something and think, this is right.</p>
<p><strong>AS: So it’s a feeling?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JK:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><strong>LH: How important is composition in your photographs?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JK:</strong> It’s not a good photograph without good composition. Originally I’m an aeronautical engineer. Why do airplanes fly? Because there is balance.</p>
<p>A good photograph speaks to many different people for different reasons. It depends on what people have been through and how they react.</p>
<p>The other sign of good photography for me is to ask, “What am I going to remember?” It happens very, very rarely that you see something that you can’t forget, and this is the good photograph.</p>
<p><strong>LH: Tell us about photographing the Soviet-led invasion of Prague.</strong></p>
<p><strong>JK:</strong> I’d just gotten back from Romania, where for months I was photographing Gypsies, and my friend called me and said, “The Russians are here.” I picked up the camera, went out on the street, and I photographed just for myself. I’d never photographed events before. These pictures weren’t meant to be published. Finally they were published one year later, which is interesting, because they weren’t news anymore.</p>
<p><strong>AS: The exhibition includes several panoramas. What attracts you to this format?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JK:</strong> I love landscape. But I was never happy photographing the landscape with a standard camera. In 1986 I was asked to participate in a government project in France. They invited me to the office and I saw a panoramic camera lying on the desk. I said, “Can I borrow this camera for one week?”</p>
<p>I ran around Paris; I had to photograph everything. I realized that with this camera I could do something I’d never done before. The panoramic camera helped me go to another stage in my career, in my work. It helped me to remain interested in photography, to be fascinated with photography.</p>
<p>I’m going to be 77. When I met [Henri] Cartier-Bresson, he was 62. I’m 15 years older than Cartier-Bresson was then. And at that time Cartier-Bresson was stopping his work with photography.</p>
<p>It’s not normal to feel that you have to do something, that you love to do something. If that’s happening you have to pay attention so you don’t lose it.</p>
<p><strong>AS: In an interview at the Art Institute of Chicago you said you’ve “never met a bad person.” I see much empathy and love in your photographs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>JK:</strong> That’s up to you [laughs].</p>
<p><strong>AS: Are people fundamentally good?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JK: </strong>I’ve been traveling 45 years without stopping, so of course things have happened to me that weren’t right. But even “bad” people behave a certain way because you don’t give them the opportunity to behave well. When you start to communicate with somebody, things go a different way.</p>
<p><strong>AS: Can you give an example?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JK:</strong> Have a look at the Russian soldiers [in my photographs of the Soviet-led invasion of Prague]. Okay, they were invaders. But at the same time, they were guys like me. They were maybe five years younger. As much as it might sound strange, I didn’t feel any hatred toward them. I knew they didn’t want to be there. They behaved a certain way because their officers ordered them to. I become friendly with some of them. In a normal situation, I’d have invited these guys to have a drink with me.</p>
<p>I can’t say I met one bad person [while photographing] in Israel either. Once I was in East Jerusalem with a photographer friend who went with me. We were planning to eat sandwiches under the trees. Suddenly, soldiers ran over with guns. One of them hit and broke my camera. But when I looked in his face, he had the same fear as the Russian soldiers in ’68. I’m sure if I’d had the opportunity to talk to this guy, he would never have done that.</p>
<p><strong>LH: To be a wonderful photographer, you have to have empathy for the human condition.</strong></p>
<p><strong>JK: </strong>We are all the same. And we are composed from the bad and the good.</p>
<p><strong>LH: May we ask you to comment on a few of your photographs?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JK: </strong>I wouldn’t talk about the photographs. No, I try to separate myself completely from what I do. I try to step back to look at them as somebody who has nothing to do with them.</p>
<p>When I travel, I show my pictures to everybody—to see what they like, what they don’t like. A good photograph speaks to many different people for different sorts of reasons. And it depends what sort of lives these people have. What they’ve gone through. It happens very rarely that you see something you can’t forget. That is a good photograph.</p>
<p><strong>LH: What’s the role of the professional photographer today, when everyone is empowered to take photographs?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JK:</strong> I think it’s wonderful that everybody can take photographs, just like I think it’s wonderful everybody can write. But there are very few writers and there are very few photographers.</p>
<p>Everybody has a camera, everybody can press the button. Everybody has a pencil, everybody can make a signature. But that doesn’t mean there are many great writers and it doesn’t mean there are many great photographers.</p>
<p><strong>AS: What do you see as the difference between photography and art?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JK: </strong>I never use the expressions “art” or “artist.” In Israel we were stopped every day, sometimes five times a day, when we were photographing. Once my friend turned to the soldiers and he said, “He’s not a reporter, he’s an artist!”</p>
<p>I’ve only said I’m am artist once—when I nearly got into trouble in Algeria [laughs]. If I said I’m a photographer, I would really get into trouble. If you’re artist, you’re all right.</p>
<p><strong>AS: Why don’t you call yourself an artist?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JK:</strong> I’m a photographer, that’s all. Like anything else, not all paintings are art. Not all photographs are art. They might be, but it’s not up to me to say.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.jimfryer.com/">Jim Fryer</a> and Iri Greco spend most of the year touring Europe, capturing the sights and sounds of <a href="http://www.uci.ch/">the Union Cycliste Internationale World Tour</a>. The couple, who maintain homes in New York and San Francisco, make photos and videos of the sport’s premier athletes, events and locales for clients such as Specialized Bicycle Components and SRAM. And while their personal and professional relationships may have begun at a bike race, their paths to that meeting couldn’t have started more differently. 
<p>Jim Fryer is a cycling lifer. He raced competitively as a child growing up in Los Angeles, competing in events on the juniors circuit and eventually going pro. After an early retirement in 1997 at the age of 24, he stayed close to the industry, starting a company that used a new inkjet process to make custom short-run cycling apparel. While the stress and frustration of being an early adopter of the new technology led him to sell the business—and spend a few years at The GAP trading on his product development experience—he always found a way back to cycling. </p>
<p>“[I] always…kind of kept a foot in the door, if you will,” Fryer says, “One thing about cycling, even though it is across the globe…you just see the same people over and over.”</p>
<p>In 2008, he launched <a href="http://www.cyclistvillage.com/">cyclistvillage.com</a>—a social-media website dedicated to cycling—with venture-capital backing. The site got American cycling legend Frankie Andreu to review products on-camera to drive traffic, sampling gear provided by bike manufacturers such as Specialized, Trek, Look and Fuji, among others. While the site never took off, event producers in the cycling industry took note of the quality of Fryer’s videos, and he was able to get work producing promotional reels and commercials for the companies whose goods cyclistvillage.com had been reviewing. </p>
<p>In 2009 Fryer re-branded his operation as <a href="http://www.brakethroughmedia.com/#!/index">BrakeThrough Media</a>. Heading into the season he had one client: Specialized. His relationship with Specialized—which stretches back to when it sponsored him as a pro—would prove strong. The company sent him to shoot at the Tour of California, where he met Iri Greco. </p>
<p>At the time, Greco was a field producer for a documentary film following a cycling team, but she was no bike enthusiast. Disillusioned after a decade working with food—both in the kitchen and as a stylist—she was up for something new. “I didn’t really care about the cycling part,” she says. “It was a breath of fresh air...and then I met that guy.” </p>
<p>A New Yorker, Greco was an art school kid who worked in Manhattan’s garment district as a teenager. When she went off to college in Wisconsin, she worked in restaurants to pay for school, and decided she wanted to be a chef. After moving to San Francisco to work in “progressively more serious kitchens” throughout her 20s, Greco found herself doing freelance food styling for magazines, such as <em>Martha Stewart Living</em>. </p>
<p>She broke into video production after parlaying a friendship with a Food Network employee into a tryout with the network. She found work on PBS shows such as <em>Lidia’s Family Table</em>, doing demos at Macy’s and cooking segments on morning shows like <em>Today</em> and <em>Good Morning America</em>. </p>
<p>Successful but unfulfilled, Greco was having dinner with a producer friend when he asked her to describe what her ideal job would be like. When she described the tasks she liked to do, his response was, “You want to be a producer.” So she started her own one-woman visual media company, <a href="http://vimeo.com/panforte">Panforte Productions</a>. By the time she met Fryer, she had been informally auditioning partners for Panforte, and he had just gone solo with BrakeThrough Media.</p>
<p>“When he and I met, we were both thirsting for a new partnership,” Greco says. “We saw it in each other and said: Let’s work together. Our first project was in Belgium, shooting commercials for the Federation of American Cycling.”</p>
<p>The gregarious Greco quickly made friends in the notoriously insular cycling community, and as she and Fryer hit it off, they began to develop their own style. </p>
<p>“Coming from food, where everything is really sensual and textural, there’s a lot of extreme close-ups,” Greco says. “I applied this approach…to sport.” </p>
<p>They taught themselves how to shoot and edit. They developed a unique perspective: with lots of low angles, close-ups of sweat, skin, dirt and other details, they emphasized the visceral qualities of cycling, much like one would a gourmet meal. “We shoot mud like it’s chocolate cake,” Greco says. “We shoot sweat like it’s the beads of condensation on a glass of cold milk. That’s the way I see the world. And he began to see it that way.”</p>
<p>But by 2011, their clients’ budgets (and thus, crews) were shrinking, so they transitioned from Panasonic camcorders to DSLRs. New tools in hand, they started taking high-quality behind-the-scenes photos at work throughout the cycling season to promote their business. HTC, the main corporate sponsor of the Specialized team they were shadowing, took notice. When HTC hired them to shoot video and photos for the rest of the tour, they made the rare transition from videographers to photographers. They spent the next year hustling photo and video work. </p>
<p>Erick Marcheschi, Specialized’s content creation manager, says Fryer and Greco’s unique perspective stands out. The company hires other photographers for standard race fare, but they bring something else to the table. </p>
<p>“What Jim and Iri were doing was a little bit different, more behind-the-scenes,” Marcheschi says. “A day-in-the-life, embedding with the teams themselves, building relationships with the teams and the riders.”</p>
<p>These days BrakeThrough Media prefers to shoot stills rather than video. By paying their own way to follow the 2013 World Tour, Greco and Fryer were able to make their own schedule, then convinced Marcheschi and other clients such as SRAM, <a href="http://velonews.competitor.com/">VeloNews.com</a> and the cycling team Omega Pharma-Quick Step to pay them on retainer. Rather than rely on one huge sponsor to pay for all their expenses, they can spread the costs among several. They know which races their clients will want covered, their turnaround times are fast and they strive to get shots the other guys don’t.  </p>
<p>“They understand cycling, they get it,” Marcheschi says. “They know instinctively what to get, and always give us surprises.”</p>
<p>Empowered by their clients’ trust with the freedom to choose what they want to cover, BrakeThrough is looking to branch out and make more travel and food-and-wine work. Gastro tours of Italy, restaurant bike treks in New York City: These are the kind of projects that suit both Greco and Fryer. With their expenses already covered by their cycling work, they hope to fill the down times in their race schedule with travel assignments that might be tougher for an editor or buyer to justify funding themselves.</p>
<p>“Travel makes the most sense, because….” Greco starts. “That’s what we’re doing anyway,” finishes Fryer.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[From the first time he heard about synesthesia, <a href="http://nigelstanford.com/">Nigel Stanford</a> was fascinated with seeing sounds. Stanford, a musician from Wellington, New Zealand, had seen a documentary on the phenomenon—in which people’s sensory and cognitive pathways in the brain get crossed—and was amazed by people who are overwhelmed by auditory response to the bright lights of Times Square, or children who see colored auras around their parents’ faces as they speak. He would learn that synesthete musicians like Pharrell and Devonte Hynes claim to see music represented as colors. 
<p>The fascination inspired Stanford to make <em><a href="http://nigelstanford.com/Cymatics/">Cymatics</a></em>, a music video that uses a pair of high-tech cameras to capture classic science experiments engineered to visualize an original song he had written. Stanford had just done the soundtrack for <a href="http://timescapes.org/">Tom Lowe’s film</a> <em><a href="http://timescapes.org/">Timescapes</a></em>, a time-lapse film featuring the night skies of the American Southwest. While he was frustrated by his lack of control over the visuals, he saw the potential in the way the film was marketed. </p>
<p>“Seeing how you could put something on Vimeo, get a trailer out, and a couple of million people will watch it…it was cool,” Stanford admits. “And I wanted to get something more for myself.”</p>
<p>Stanford was working on a new album, and had been fascinated by watching videos of experiments in cymatics—the study of visible sound vibration—online. Plenty of people had filmed experiments, but the videos were typically artless and featured one experiment at a time. Stanford wanted to combine multiple scientific phenomena into a single narrative paired with his music. He knew he would need help with the visuals, so he recruited his old friend <a href="http://www.shahirdaud.com">Shahir Daud</a>, a director and editor at MTV Networks. But while he had a concept and a director, he still didn’t have the song.</p>
<p>“We did all these experiments and found the notes that would work for the visuals,” Daud says, “and then Nigel would go away and write a piece of music that would work for those visuals.” In the video, each experiment is triggered in some way by Stanford’s music: magnetic pulses triggered when his synthesizer activated ferrofluid, the liquid in a petri dish affixed to his speaker rippling in time to the music, Tesla coils activated by an audio signal shooting bolts of electricity. Because different sounds would create different displays, Stanford had to write music that would induce esthetically pleasing visuals. </p>
<p>Some of the equipment for the experiments could be rented, but much of it was custom-built, and each one had its own quirks that required consideration. They discovered, for example, that the Chladni plate (a vibrating plate that makes patterns with sand) they had hooked up to Stanford’s synthesizer requires long, sustained tones to create the visual patterns. They collected seven experiments, including Nikola Tesla’s famous coils and a plasma ball, incorporating them into the video—and therefore, the song—in ascending order, starting with the experiments that used the smallest equipment, and moving to those that made the biggest visual impact. Each part builds upon the other’s into a crescendo until they are all being played simultaneously during the song’s climax. Since Stanford plays all the parts of the song on record, he and Daud cast body doubles. When the shot called for close-ups of his face, they composited multiple images of Stanford with the frame, making for an ironically more “honest” depiction of how the music is made. They perfected the experiments as Stanford finished writing the song, made storyboards for every shot and assembled a team for a two-day shoot at <a href="http://www.the1896.com/">The 1896, a studio in Brooklyn, NY.</a> </p>
<p>On the recommendation of photographer/director <a href="http://www.laforetvisuals.com/">Vincent Laforet</a>, Daud hired cinematographer <a href="http://timurcivan.com">Timur Civan</a>, who used a combination of vintage glass and high-tech sensors to define the video’s visual esthetic. Almost everything had to be done in-camera, because other than the few composites of Nigel, there were no computer-generated images—everything you see in the video happened in the studio. Civan would prove helpful in solving the technical challenges of capturing the experiments’ fleeting moments of beauty.</p>
<p>“Some of the things are spectacular, but they’re over in a fraction of a second,” Civan explains. “Mainly the ferrofluid, and the electrical components of the Tesla coils. The lightning bolt in the air, to your brain it’s a few seconds, but to the camera it’s really only up for 1/100,000 of a second or something. So you have to shoot really high frame rates to try and get it spread over two frames, so you can cut all the air out.”</p>
<p>Civan and his crew took an entire day to prep the lights at the massive studio. They blanketed the warehouse space with light so the camera could move freely throughout with minimal adjustment of the equipment. He shot with a RED camera sporting the new 6.5K Dragon sensor, and a set of Russian Lomo square-front anamorphic lenses. The ancient coatings on the Russian lenses added dramatic flares, and the anamorphic ratio let them pack multiple Nigels into the frame. </p>
<p>To capture the fast-moving experiments, they worked in footage from the high-speed PhantomFlex camera, capable of capturing 1280x720p video at 1000 frames per second. For example, the bolts of electricity from the Tesla coil moved so fast that Civan would have to assemble key frames from the high-speed footage on set to make them sync with the music. Daud and Stanford mostly stuck to their original storyboards when they edited the video, and they finished and graded the video in 4K, with the 720p footage from the PhantomFlex scaled up. </p>
<p>When <em>Cymatics</em> was released, it quickly went viral, earning <a href="http://bit.ly/1DoSk0i">a Vimeo Staff Pick</a> and racking up more than two million views across platforms on the Web. Stanford says he’s received offers to perform the music and the experiments live, and the pair hope to build on the momentum and make another music video, but it may prove difficult—<em>Cymatics</em> took almost year to assemble, edit and grade after the shoot in December 2013. Daud, for his part, is already starting to think about scaling back his day job in TV.</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[AP photographer <a href="http://www.apimages.com/Collection/Landing/Photographer-Matt-Slocum-Sports/5733341e8bce4539a5b9c79af4c0344a/1">Matt Slocum’s</a> rise to the top echelons of sports photography is the result of his passion, hard work and taking advantage of opportunities. “I kept hopping up the food chain,” starting with his high school newspaper, says the 33-year-old photographer. He adds, “It wasn’t quick.”
<p>From the start, Slocum was fascinated with the gear and craft of photography. He read every photography book and magazine he could get his hands on. “I was completely obsessed. I was always pushing, always thinking,” he says.</p>
<p>He gravitated to sports photography, for the thrill of its constant action. He also liked that he could get good results by following basic rules—narrow depth of field, high shutter speed, subject in focus, the rule of thirds. And once he mastered the basics, he had fun figuring out how to break the rules—shoot into backlight, for instance, or use fish-eye lenses—to get something different. </p>
<p>And he missed no opportunity to practice. The high school he attended in Duncanville, Texas had a strong sports program and a good school newspaper. There were games to shoot all year long. </p>
<p>Even better for Slocum, it was the late ’90s, when the <em>Dallas Morning News</em> and the <em>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</em> were having an old-fashioned newspaper war. Slocum shot high school games shoulder-to-shoulder with photographers from those papers. “I was able to pick their brains,” he says. Before long, he was contributing to both papers as a freelancer, and learning from professional photo editors. </p>
<p>“You look at what you messed up, what made the papers the next day, what didn’t make the papers, what you thought was really nice that nobody cared about,” he says. “You learn that everyone runs the storytelling pictures, as opposed to the pretty pictures.”</p>
<p>After high school, he attended the University of Texas at Arlington, home of <em>The Shorthorn</em>, one of the best college papers in the state. “You would shoot and shoot and shoot,” he says.</p>
<p>By his junior year he started landing internships, first at the <em>Corpus Christi Caller-Times</em>, then the <em>Star-Telegram</em>, and finally at the <em>Arizona Republic</em>. “I did two or three assignments a day. They treated me like a staffer,” he says of the <em>Arizona Republic</em> internship. On his free time, he went to shoot Arizona Diamondbacks baseball games for practice—“just to do it over and over,” he says.</p>
<p>Slocum reels off a list of newspaper photographers who taught him how to shoot not just sports, but news and features, too. In particular he remembers the late Randy Reid, an <em>Arizona Republic</em> photographer “who burst my bubble. I’m sure I was in there with a big head, acting like I knew everything. He was threatening to come to a game with a Nikon F3 and a roll of black-and-white film and whip my ass.”</p>
<p>Reid never made good on his threat, but Slocum says the important lesson he learned was “not to be an asshole. Be humble. Do your job. You don’t need drama. Just do it, and do it good.”</p>
<p>Nearing graduation, Slocum started sending clips from his internships and freelance assignments to Tony Gutierrez, a UT-Arlington graduate who had parlayed an AP internship into a staff job. Gutierrez began asking Slocum, a leisurely college student, when he was going to graduate. “In hindsight, he was keeping an eye on me, pushing me. Finally he said, ‘You need to apply [for an AP internship] when you graduate.’”</p>
<p>That gave Slocum incentive to finish college, and he landed an internship in AP’s Dallas bureau in 2005. He looked at the internship as another opportunity to improve his skills. And Gutierrez continued to push him—and push for him. “He’d try get [me] better gigs,” Slocum says.</p>
<p>The internship led to a series of three-month contracts with AP, beginning with a temporary job, filling in for a Dallas-based AP photographer who spent weeks in New Orleans covering Hurricane Katrina. “If they like you, they find a way to keep you around,” Slocum says.</p>
<p>In 2007, he ended up in a job-sharing arrangement with another AP photographer who needed a more flexible schedule. Meanwhile, he had his eye on AP’s job board for full-time job openings in cities where he’d have a chance to shoot a lot of sports. In 2009, an opening came up in Philadelphia, which has four pro sports franchises. Slocum has now held that job for five years.</p>
<p>“He’s the type of photographer [AP] is looking for,” says Denis Paquin, AP’s deputy director of photography, who explains that AP photographers have to be able to shoot all types of assignments, not just a single specialty, like sports. They also have to be able to look critically at their own work and strive constantly to improve. </p>
<p>Slocum says that starting at the bottom and working your way up isn’t the only way to establish a career in sports photography. “It’s just how I got here, slow and steady,” he says. His advice to others on that path is to embrace it as a learning process, not resent it as a dues-paying exercise. </p>
<p>He also warns against the misperception “that you’re nobody if you’re not shooting professional sports.” The lighting conditions, the freedom to move around the field, and opportunities to experiment are often far better at high school and college games, which aren’t stage-managed for TV audiences, he explains. </p>
<p>Slocum is nostalgic for his formative experience, but says, “The appeal of the big leagues, to me, is the chance to see [through a camera] something great…professional photographers are trying to capture those storytelling moments and a little history, too.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Photographing top athletes comes with a unique set of challenges. The subjects typically bring all of the trappings of celebrity — publicists, entourages, tight schedules — but unlike famous actors, have no training in performing in front of a camera. A portrait shoot with a busy sports star requires the ability to work fast, as well as the directing skills to elicit a spark of personality from the subject quickly. 
<p>We asked three photographers — <a href="http://www.berez.net/overview/">Randi Berez</a>, <a href="http://jjmillerphotography.com/">JJ Miller</a> and <a href="http://johnhuet.com/">John Huet</a> — for tips on how you can get the nuanced and interesting shots you want from a professional athlete.</p>
<p><strong>1. Be Prepared</strong></p>
<p>Berez, Miller and Huet all noted that you need to be ready to shoot the moment the subject walks on set. Miller estimates that he usually gets between five and ten minutes to capture 25 shots, as well as to create video footage. Increasingly, he also needs shots for social media and viral content. As a result, he makes sure he has drawn up not only lighting set-ups, but also sketches of poses he’d like the athletes to try. “If you plan well in advance, ten minutes actually seems like a lot of time,” he notes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.si.com/nhl/2014/11/18/montreal-canadiens-pk-subban-sports-illustrated-cover">On a recent cover shoot for <em>Sports Illustrated</em> with P.K. Subban</a>, a defenseman for the National Hockey League’s Montreal Canadiens, Huet encountered some resistance from Subban’s publicist regarding timing. He was scheduled to shoot at the same time as another publication that dropped out at the last minute. When he asked for the 15 extra minutes the cancellation freed up, the publicist told him he could have five. “Their schedules are so busy that every minute counts,” he says. </p>
<p>Whether Berez is shooting for advertising or editorial clients, she makes sure that a blueprint for the shoot is created and distributed so that everyone knows what to expect on the day of the shoot. “I usually show up with something in hand I can show my subjects as a starting point,” she says.</p>
<p><strong>2. Be Aware That Their Bodies Are Their Equipment</strong></p>
<p>As a photographer, Berez is always looking for an iconic image. However, she is acutely aware that an athlete’s body is their job. As a result, she is mindful not only of the poses that she asks them to take, but also of the fact that she often shoots them in between work-outs, or on a day when they’re supposed to be resting. In essence, that she’s asking them to work when they’re supposed to be recuperating.</p>
<p>On a recent trip to photograph soccer player <a href="http://www.mensfitness.com/life/sports/inside-us-teams-world-cup-training-regimen">Graham Zusi for</a> <em><a href="http://www.mensfitness.com/life/sports/inside-us-teams-world-cup-training-regimen">Men’s Fitness</a></em>, she received an email notifying her that Zusi had been injured in practice. “Nobody wanted to cancel the shoot, but we needed dynamic shots,” she explains. She considered a number of options, including having a teammate do the action while Zusi posed for a portrait. In the end, she had her assistant buy a crash pad. Although Zusi was not at 100-percent capability when he showed up for the shoot the next day, after seeing the crash pad, he was more than willing to give a few high-energy action shots. </p>
<p><strong>3. Get Familiar With the Language</strong></p>
<p>Before he became a professional photographer, Miller played baseball in college. As a result, he’s familiar with the language that professional athletes, and especially baseball players, use when being coached. He is able to utilize this lingo when he’s asking them to assume poses in front of the camera. “I explain it to them in terms they understand,” he says. He doesn’t believe it’s necessary for a sports photographer to have been an athlete, however. “You just have to understand how the body moves,” he says.</p>
<p>Berez notes that professional athletes have an uncommon degree of physical self-awareness. “Once you break down an action and determine which part of that action you want to capture, [your subjects] are able to make minor adjustments in body position that make a huge difference on camera,” she says.  </p>
<p><strong>4. Do Your Research</strong></p>
<p>Professional athletes are not particularly known for their ability to emote. While music can create a more relaxed atmosphere, it’s sometimes not enough. In order to prevent any awkwardness — which ultimately leads to time wasted — Huet does his research. “I try to find out a little bit about that person. If I need a little juice, I try to use something he or she’s familiar with, or something they’ll react to.”</p>
<p>On a shoot with Michael Phelps for a Mazda commercial, for example, Huet relaxed the athlete by giving him playful crap about the Baltimore Ravens. “He’s a big Ravens fan, and I’m from Pittsburgh, so I like the Steelers,” he explains. The challenge soon became keeping Phelps focused once he was riled up.</p>
<p>Researching an athlete in advance helps Miller determine whom he should have on his crew, to make sure there is someone on the set the subject can relate to. Sometimes when Miller is shooting a female athlete, for example, he’ll have a female camera assistant on set.   </p>
<p><strong>5. It’s No Time to Be Starstruck</strong></p>
<p>Being talented is no longer enough for a professional athlete to be successful. They need to approach their profession, their public image and their relationship with their fans with gravitas. “A lot of these people are at the tops of their fields,” notes Huet. “They are professionals, and they want to feel that the people around them are the same way.” He adds, “Just understand it’s another person you’re directing. It’s no different than the portrait of the computer engineer you’ve done the day before, even if that person is a sports legend.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Successful photojournalism careers are built on grit, hard work, and personal sacrifice, and National Geographic Photography Fellow Lynn Johnson knows as well as anyone about all three. During a candid and at times emotional presentation before a standing-room-only audience at the annual National Geographic Magazine Photography Seminar last month, Johnson described some of the most significant struggles and lessons of her 40-year career. 
<p>"Photography is service. I say this work is service," she told photographer Vince Musi, who served as emcee of the January 15 event, and interviewed Johnson on stage in the auditorium of National Geographic headquarters.</p>
<p>Known for her complex stories about a wide range of topics, Johnson emphasized that her loyalty and obligation is always to her subjects. "I think that is the essential relationship and the most important relationship--with the person you are photographing. That is the act of service," she said. To that end, her goal is to set aside her ego and become as invisible as she can "so that whoever is on the other side of the camera essentially emerges to the viewer."</p>
<p>Against the current fashion of personal narrative and subjective reportage, Johnson's approach may seem quaint and old-fashioned--a reflection of the photojournalistic mores of the 1970s, when her career began. But the lessons she learned still apply.</p>
<p>Johnson recounted stories from the trenches of the <em>Pittsburgh Press</em>, which she joined in 1975. "One thing I learned as a newspaper photographer [was] to be tenacious, but also… humility," she said.</p>
<p>She was young, ambitious, and the first female photographer on staff. Her colleagues "were all like old press guys, cigar-chewing," she said, adding that one said to her, "We're glad you're here because you can do all the tea parties now."</p>
<p>In a telephone interview with <em>PDN</em> afterwards, Johnson explained how offended she was by that remark, but also how determined it made her. When assignments came in from the city desk, she says, she didn't wait for her boss to delegate them. She just looked them over for the most challenging assignment. </p>
<p>"The bloodier and more intense, the better," she says. "I would just take it and walk out the back door [to shoot it] because I knew they would never give those assignments to me, but I had to prove myself again and again and again."</p>
<p>At the National Geographic seminar, Johnson also recounted her indignation at a <em>Pittsburgh Press</em> colleague, Don Stetzer, who probably saved her from injury on the sidelines of a football game by picking her up and moving her out of the path of an on-rushing player.</p>
<p>Instead of thanking Stetzer, Johnson told him, "How dare you interfere?" </p>
<p>"I was so young, and so angry at these guys for trying to put me in this lesser, demeaning place," she tells <em>PDN</em>. The constant anger eventually drove her to quit the paper, and start freelancing. "It took me many more years to understand that they were my teachers, and were in fact a great gift," she says.</p>
<p>At the National Geographic seminar, Johnson recounted how she hit another low point in the late 1990s, when she had two stories killed in succession. The first, a story for <em>LIFE</em> magazine about the dragging death of James Byrd near Jasper, Texas, was bumped at the last minute because of breaking news about the Columbine High School massacre. Within a year, <em>National Geographic</em> killed another story she'd photographed about pain.</p>
<p>"I had spent months with people who felt their pain could be given meaning and purpose by sharing their story so others would not have to suffer as they had suffered," Johnson says. When the story was all laid out, she got a call from then-editor Bill Allen. "He said, 'We can't run that story. It's too painful to look at.'"</p>
<p>She appreciated his candor and professionalism, but Johnson felt a sense of failure. Around the same time, her marriage ended because she was rarely home. To make matters worse, a photo editor told Johnson she would never work with her again because doing so was like "being dropped into a pit with a cloud over it."</p>
<p>Convinced there was "something I didn't know," she says, Johnson returned to Ohio University for a master's degree. School didn't fix things, she told Musi, but time and more experience did. Without marriage "pulling at me," she tells <em>PDN</em>, she was able to immerse herself completely in her assignments, and the process of her work. "I had to continue to grow to be capable of telling other people's stories. And stories I was telling were more and more complex."</p>
<p>It was around that time that Johnson learned to connect on a deep, intense level with her subjects. She explains, "I can never promise [a subject] that our time together will end up on page or screen. I used to feel like I could do that. So I feel like only thing I can truly give is my attention, and that's the most important thing," she says. "When you're with [someone] by a bedside and their child is dying, it is our human intimacy that will carry the day."</p>
<p>That intimacy arises from being present, and "listening with every fiber of who you are," she says. "Listening to their words, looking at their body language, listening to the unspoken message [they're telling you]. Sitting, watching, meeting their eye. It's kind of like the devotional center of the work.</p>
<p>"Which doesn't mean I'm not shooting, too. Keeping both of those strands [listening and shooting] alive and active simultaneously can be a challenge," she adds.</p>
<p>Putting the needs of her subject first--ahead of her own, and ahead of <em>National Geographic</em>'s--is essential to maintaining the integrity of those relationships, Johnson says. In her interview with Musi, she recounted a recent experience photographing a subject named Phyllis, for a project about dying that Johnson is now working on for <em>National Geographic</em>.</p>
<p>Phyllis was the mother of Johnson's close friend Nancy Andrews, who is Chief of Innovation at <em>Detroit Free Press</em>. Johnson was under editors' orders to shoot the story in medium format. But as Phyllis was slipping away, Johnson felt her medium-format camera was too intrusive. Her editor insisted she stick with it. Johnson says she finally refused, and started using her iPhone instead. </p>
<p>"There were only three of us present when [Phyllis] passed away: Nancy, her partner, and me. It was the most mystical time," Johnson told Musi and the National Geographic audience. "To [photograph the moment with] anything other than that small device would have been an abomination."</p>
<p>Lingering over the end of Johnson's talk was a sense of melancholy over the personal relationships, particularly with her parents, but also with colleagues, that she's sacrificed for her career.</p>
<p>"A lot of us leave. This is what we do. We probably can count the number of relationship by the [way]side--people that are still pissed off at you," she told Musi. "So it just feel like to me all those stories I've done over the years are the accumulated wisdom that I hope I can bring to this time of life, because I think now it's time to learn how to stay."</p>
<p>Johnson described in moving terms a recent experience she had visiting and photographing her parents, who are both old and in fragile health. "The amazing thing to me was very large men were coming up to me [afterwards] and saying, 'Wow, I was crying,'" Johnson tells <em>PDN</em>. "A lot of us are at an age where parents are struggling, we're pulled in lots of directions, and have personal challenges." <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">	</span></p>
<p>She acknowledges that she has also kept her distance from the photo community, because she was always so focused on her work, and because she naturally assumes the role of outsider and observer. But something changed during her talk in January, Johnson says.</p>
<p>"I feel this bizarre sense of rebirth in that community, which I never felt a part of. I just let myself belong. I think part of it was being up there with Vince, looking into his eyes. It felt like a conversation with him, with everyone, for ourselves. It felt intimate and joyful."</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Editorial and fine-art photographer <a href="http://www.markpeckmezian.com/">Mark Peckmezian</a>, who shoots for<em> The New Yorker</em>, <em>The FADER</em>, <em>Dazed and Confused</em> and other clients, moves comfortably between various esthetics using a diversity of tools. In an email interview with <em>PDN</em>, he explains what gear he carries and how it informs his work.
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What equipment do you carry on a typical job?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> I generally get away with shooting film. For those jobs, on location, I’ll usually take my Hasselblad 500C/M with four film backs and a set of lenses, a Voigtl&auml;nder Bessa with a Leica Summicron lens, and sometimes my Rolleiflex TLR and Graflex 4x5. Generally, the Hasselblad is my camera of choice.</p>
<p>I also bring Nikon and Metz flashes, and usually my Profoto lighting kit: An Acute 2400 pack, three heads, beauty dish, black foil, umbrellas and soft boxes, gels, etc. For film, in black-and-white I shoot Kodak Tri-X 400 and sometimes, Ilford Pan-F. But Tri-X is the best. In color, I mainly use Kodak Portra, but sometimes I’ll use Ektar. I only wish they still made Tri-X 400 in 4x5! Ugh! I lust for that. Digitally, I generally use a Nikon D800 with 35mm, 50mm, and 85mm Zeiss lenses.</p>
<p>The desired esthetic determines most such choices, although that is often hemmed in by practical factors. On location, like <a href="http://www.thefader.com/2015/01/29/chance-the-rapper-donnie-trumpet-the-social-experiment-cover-story">a recent shoot with [rap artist] Tyler, The Creator for</a> <em><a href="http://www.thefader.com/2015/01/29/chance-the-rapper-donnie-trumpet-the-social-experiment-cover-story">The FADER</a></em>, I used a simple portable kit with my Hasselblad. On a recent job in South America, I had to use digital because of the risk of airport workers refusing to hand-check film, and it being x-rayed. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Why so many different cameras? </strong></p>
<p><strong>MP: </strong>For a recent story I did for <em>Muse</em> magazine, I used everything: my Voigtl&auml;nder, Hasselblad, Rolleiflex and 4x5. Each camera has an entirely different feel and I chose the camera according to the concept for each photo. This was particularly appropriate for this story because it was part of the concept for the story to play between a variety of different fashion/historical esthetics.</p>
<p>For natural-light shots where I wanted flare and soft tones, I used my early-model Zeiss 150mm for the Hasselblad or my 1930s Rolleiflex. Each has inferior lens coatings that make them especially prone to flare. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Why do you choose to stick with film?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MP: </strong>There are a lot of reasons. I like the personality of film—or, rather, the different personalities of different film types and cameras. For celebrity portraits, film has the huge advantage of precluding publicists and handlers from interfering with the shoot. There are a few notable occasions where I probably couldn’t have gotten away with what I shot but for the fact I shot film—like the Bill Gates shoot for <em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em>.</p>
<p>For my artwork, film has a conceptual import that is often critical to what I’m going for. Namely, I often want to create images that are timeless—from no readily identifiable place or era—and film has been the common form for the entire history of photography until 20 years ago.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How does the gear affect your aesthetic? Does each piece of gear contribute to your overall style, or do you get different things from different cameras?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> The lenses determine much of the quality, I think. The Zeiss lenses for the Hasselblad have such a particular personality, you can spot it a mile away. It generally trends towards sharp, defined and contrasty, with a very particular coloring. For all these reasons, the lenses work well for any poppy or hard-flash esthetic, like the bodybuilding convention I shot for <em>Sportsnet</em>. I have a Hasselblad Softar soft-focus filter that I’ve become obsessed with and use very often. </p>
<p>The Rolleiflex lens has a totally different personality: sharp, but low-contrast and prone to flaring beautifully. I use it a lot with black-and-white. I also love the slightly wide 75mm perspective. I shoot in many different styles. I choose cameras, lenses and film accordingly. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you choose between, say, the Hasselblad and Rolleiflex when you’re on assignment?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> For a recent fashion story I shot for <em><a href="https://thehappyreader.com/">The Happy Reader</a></em> (a new magazine by the creators of <em>Fantastic Man</em>), I decided to do it all on Rolleiflex. I find that the Rolleiflex loves Tri-X and hard flash—for some reason it’s just perfect for that camera. If I shot it on the Hasselblad, the contrast would be too harsh. The Zeiss lenses for that are great, but can often have too much contrast and definition. The Rollei gives a softer rendering.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s determined by budget or turn-around time, but it’s mostly decided well in advance, and is based on my concept for the shoot. The right pairing of the style with subject is critical in my mind. I might decide on a low-key and classical esthetic, in which case I’ll bring my 4x5 and Pan-F film. And so on.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How often do you use portable flashes? Will it differ from studio to location shoots?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> I bring my portable flashes with me all the time, on everything, even if only for inconspicuous fill lighting. I also bring the aforementioned Profoto kit. I love hard flash, and even on shoots where the key shot is with other lighting, I’ll try a few options with the flash. To me, hard flash is not merely an esthetic, it’s an entire mode of shooting. </p>
<p>For a shoot in my own studio, like <a href="http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/21343/1/laverne-cox-werq-it-out">the recent one with Laverne Cox for</a> <em><a href="http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/21343/1/laverne-cox-werq-it-out">Dazed and Confused</a></em>, I obviously use any and everything I have. For shoots at rented studios—which is to say, for bigger budget shoots—I usually switch up my lighting quite a bit. I’ll get Profoto Pro packs, twin heads, octoboxes, and other gear I like, but don’t own.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Will what you bring to a shoot differ on an editorial job, as opposed to your your personal work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MP: </strong>The distinction is shrinking more and more—I feel lucky to be doing my commissioned work in a way that is more and more like my personal work. This is a freedom I didn’t always have. </p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[For Mike Arzt, photography is one piece of a career that seems limited only by his imagination and by the capabilities of the company he co-founded, <a href="http://www.thepublicworks.biz/">The Public Works</a>. Arzt has a big-picture understanding of how photography works with and complements filmmaking, design, marketing, sales, brand development and even fabrication. In a given week, he and his colleagues might be photographing Formula 1 races in Montreal or the U.S. Ski Team in Austria, or producing a multimedia shoot for Airstream in the Aspen, Colorado, backcountry.
<p>Arzt took a deep interest in photography early on—he built a darkroom in high school and “kept shooting” as he got older, he says. As someone who “shaped my life around snowboarding,” Arzt would read snowboarding magazines and pay attention to the photographers, not the athletes. Early influences included photographers like Kevin Zacher, Mark Gallup and <a href="http://www.vincentskoglund.com/">Vincent Skoglund</a>. </p>
<p>Arzt started working at Burton Snowboards as a student at the University of Vermont. During his tenure there, he did sales and marketing, and then traveled with Burton’s sponsored athletes. While he was helping produce one of the last photo shoots he worked on at Burton, Arzt made some images that drew compliments and encouragement from pro photographers who worked for Burton. “That motivated me to leave Burton and go to work in a multimedia role,” he says.</p>
<p>After a stint at a sports multimedia startup that went boom and bust during the dot-com bubble of the late ’90s, he moved to Airwalk Snowboards as global snow marketing manager. At Airwalk, he and the other staffers shot much of the photography and video the company used in its marketing, which was part of the appeal of the work. As part of his hiring bonus, Arzt got a new camera setup. His work has “always been a mix of marketing but also executing” creative concepts, he says.</p>
<p>In 2006, Arzt partnered with Frank Phillips, who was head of the engineering department at Burton while Arzt was there. The pair founded The Public Works, a “brand storytelling company,” in Denver, Colorado. “We were motivated by trying to combine the worlds of product design with marketing,” Arzt recalls. Initially they thought they would develop products, but they also “wanted to be able to offer up the full range of [creative] services, so that if we came up with a good product idea we [would] be able to put the entire business and marketing plan together.”</p>
<p>Eventually they did get around to creating products, including a furniture line, but early on they worked for clients including Red Bull, <a href="http://www.hellyhansen.com/">Helly Hansen</a> and Aspen Ski Company. For Red Bull, they did custom fabrication and photographed skiing, snowboarding and other sports and events. For Helly Hansen, they managed global snow-sports marketing—signing athletes, producing photo shoots and hiring photographers—but also created visual assets for the brand themselves. For Aspen Ski Company, they produced photography and video work.</p>
<p>Arzt says The Public Works team spends most of its time “trying to keep up with everything on our plate”—their new work comes mostly through word-of-mouth, although they occasionally pursue clients they want to work for. “If an opportunity presents itself, then we go after it really hard,” he says. After repeated requests from clients for brand projects that included customized Airstream trailers, Arzt decided to cold call Airstream to introduce them to The Public Works. Three years later, “we have a really good partnership and some big plans for the future,” Arzt says. (They also have a 28-foot trailer they are customizing into a mobile production studio.)</p>
<p>Though snow sports were a big part of their work early on, Arzt says they’ve been able to expand into doing work for a variety of clients interested in reaching active people. “Snowboard or action sports stuff leads to other companies, whether it’s Whole Foods or Subaru,” Arzt notes.</p>
<p>Clients also appreciate their lean approach, which is often light on production and heavy on results. “We can get in with a tight team and we can execute on a lot of stuff,” Arzt says. “We don’t go in thinking that we need 40 people to create a 30-second [TV] spot, and that’s all [a client is] going to get.” Currently The Public Works employs 10 full-time staffers with a variety of expertise, from photography and filmmaking to fabrication and Web development.</p>
<p>While snowboard and action-sports photography remains a part of Arzt’s career and work, he and his colleagues at The Public Works have used those industries as a foundation for expansion into a variety of creative work for clients in fields as diverse as the beverage, automotive, resort and cigar industries. “We sum ourselves up as brand storytellers,” Arzt says. “Whether we do that with a mobile champagne bar, like we built for Veuve Clicquot, or a custom video project, which we’ve also done for Veuve Clicquot, they’re really just creative marketing tools to help tell a story.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[A huge part of the appeal of outdoor sports is the experience of being in inspiring landscapes. Whether they’re into surfing, rock climbing or backcountry snowboarding, athletes revel in the chance to experience beautiful, rugged and remote locales. 
<p>Photographer <a href="http://www.chrisburkard.com/">Chris Burkard</a> says his personal style is inspired equally by his love of outdoor sports and their setting. His landscape imagery is in high demand among editorial and commercial clients with the action sports industry and beyond—leading to assignments for companies like American Airlines, Toyota, Apple and Microsoft. </p>
<p>“I learned early on that if you can’t bring back a photograph that tells the story of where you are, then it could be anywhere,” Burkard tells <em>PDN</em> from his home in Central California. “That doesn’t really do much for the viewer. If you really want to create something that’s timeless, something that allows the viewer to be in that moment, you have to show the landscape.”</p>
<p>Drawn to art in high school, Burkard saw photography as a way to live a creative life without “being stuck” in a studio. “Photography was that medium where I could be out in the water with my friends surfing, or be in the mountains, or be kayaking, or whatever it was,” he explains. </p>
<p>Burkard grew up surfing, and the sport gave him his first professional experience as a photographer. But from the beginning, he was focused on the landscapes that surround the sport. “Surfing is super fun and I love it, but it was more the experience of being out in the waves and shooting the things that you see when you’re out there,” he recalls. “I was drawn to empty waves and the locations,” Burkard recalls. </p>
<p>Burkard made his first image sale to Channel Islands Surfboards, then <em><a href="http://surf.transworld.net/">Transworld Surf</a></em> magazine published his work. For the next few years he concentrated on editorial work, trying to get on surf trips funded by magazines and to sell individual images to publications. He also occasionally sold images of athletes to the brands that sponsored them. Honing his editorial skills was important, he says, because it allowed him to develop his storytelling abilities. As he gained notoriety, he got to know “like-minded” athletes and journalists who were interested in traveling to remote locations in Alaska and Iceland. “It was cool to get in touch with folks that had the same value for traveling, for obscurity, for the places I liked to go. Ultimately that was how I was able to do a lot of editorial work.”</p>
<p>Burkard also interned at <em>Transworld Surf</em> after he began selling images to the magazine, which gave him insight into the editorial process. “It allowed me to understand how to pitch to an editor, and I think that’s something a lot of people miss out on. They blindly submit photographs. They don’t have a concept of the schedule of the magazine and what they’re looking for…I found that working closer with [editors], communicating and trying to find out what they need helps to align the objectives even if you’re shooting on spec.”</p>
<p>While he was getting his name out through editorial work, he was also sharing his images on social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook and 500px. Burkard began working for commercial clients, doing jobs that drew on his editorial style. Now, 90 percent of his work is commercial, and he also maintains a senior staff photographer position with <em><a href="http://www.surfermag.com/">Surfer</a></em> magazine.</p>
<p>Burkard says careful editing of his portfolio and the work he posts to social channels have been key to growing his business and to getting the types of jobs he wants. “I’ve aimed to really be a specialist and tailor my portfolio to what I wanted to do,” he says. “Obviously, down the line of my career, I’ve shot a lot of things that aren’t necessarily my personal style. I would shoot anything to pay the bills, don’t get me wrong. But what I’ve done is really try to curate what I put out into the world, so what people see of my work are things I want to shoot.” Burkard says a lot of his commercial clients found him on social media. For this reason, instead of trying to license a great image, he’ll often publish it on his social channels. “Photos that I could potentially sell somewhere, I’d rather seed them out online and allow that to bring work back for me,” he explains.</p>
<p>Contributing ideas to his clients’ creative process is another factor in Burkard’s growth as a commercial photographer, he notes. “We’ve been able to bring [creative input] to a lot of the work we’ve done.”</p>
<p>In the past couple of years, Burkard says, he’s concentrated on making images that are timeless but also relatable. “I’ve tried not to have ‘Everest Syndrome’ in my work, which means photos of people high fiving on the top of Mount Everest. That appeals to one percent of the world. I want to shoot stuff that feels relatable, attainable; that has an element of ‘I could do that or I could be there.’ That’s really an important aspect of my work.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Photographer <a href="http://www.dylancoulter.com/">Dylan Coulter’s</a> success and reputation are due in part to his ingenuity in finding distinctive ways to capture familiar subjects. Last year, for example, his technique for creating multiple-exposure images of an athlete’s form, which he first developed on assignments for <em><a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/insider/espn-the-magazine/">ESPN The Magazine</a></em>, landed him a job shooting a still and video package on World Cup soccer stars for <em>The New York Times Magazine</em>. He parlayed that experience—and his skills at creating polished, stylized portraits of athletes—into assignments for entertainment and advertising clients. Looking back on the assignments he shot in 2014, he says, “This has been a rewarding and successful year for me, and a lot of doors have been opened.” 
<p>Coulter first explored new ways of creating images of athletes more than a dozen years ago, while he was working as an art director for Adidas in Portland, Oregon. Though he had studied photography and shot frequently for himself, he had decided to pursue a career in graphic design, and landed a job with Adidas as the sports apparel company was rebranding itself. “I was interested in pushing the kind of sports photography they did,” he recalls. At the time, most sports photography had a “photojournalistic” look. His own photography, he says, was inspired by portraiture and fashion work. “I was interested in taking lighting from those genres and applying it to sports work.”  </p>
<p>He began making studio portraits, “taking the athlete off the field of play, [which] you wouldn’t be able to do if you were on the sidelines covering action.” His experiments inspired him to leave his job and pursue freelance photography assignments. At the time, he says, photographers such as <a href="http://johnhuet.com/">John Huet</a> and other commercial shooters were beginning to redefine sports photography. From his base in Portland, Coulter was able to land shoots for several outdoor and sports clients—including his old employer, Adidas.  </p>
<p>It took a while for Adidas’s rival, Nike, to take a chance on him. On one of his first jobs for the company, he was hired to photograph runners in Nike running shoes, showing them from the waist down, and in motion. Based on the success of those shots, Nike hired him again for what started out as a small job: making portraits of speed skaters who would be competing in the Olympic Games in Salt Lake City. “They were evenly lit, with no dramatic shadow. They were crisp, frozen moments of them on the ice,” explains Coulter. The campaign was featured in the <em>PDN</em> Photo Annual and won other advertising awards, bringing wider attention to Coulter’s sports work.  </p>
<p>Though he had several enviable commercial clients, Coulter was only landing a few editorial assignments, primarily from magazines that hired him when they needed a portrait of someone in the Portland area. “By certain magazines, I was perceived as too commercial,” he says. His decision to move to New York City in 2006 was inspired by many factors, including a desire to be closer to magazine editors. “It took a while to get to know the world of editorial and form relationships,” he says, but he gradually landed assignments, shooting both sports and non-sports stories, for <em>Slam, Vibe, Men’s Health</em> and <em>Men’s Fitness</em>.</p>
<p>When <em>ESPN the Magazine</em> launched a section devoted to analyzing an athlete’s form, they contacted Coulter. He photographed a tennis player’s forehand, capturing multiple frames to show each element of her form. While traditional multiple-exposure technique captures a series of frames—with each frame given the same weight—Coulter had a different idea. He wanted to create “a visual hierarchy, where parts of the images are more opaque and some more transparent, so you know where to go with your eye.” He developed a post-production retouching technique to make the preliminary stages of the swing more transparent, leading towards the final step.  </p>
<p>Last year he used the technique on an assignment for <em>ESPN</em> to photograph the form of nine pitchers for the Arizona Diamondbacks. His images reveal startling differences. “Every pitcher wants to get the ball in the same place—the strike zone—but the way that pitchers do that is so different,” he says. “Some have a crazy windup, some no windup, one had scrapes on his knuckles from grazing the ground.”   </p>
<p>The pitching story elicited a positive response from <a href="http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/author/kathy-ryan/?_r=0">Kathy Ryan</a>, the director of photography at <em>The New York Times Magazine</em>. Coulter had been sending his work to Ryan for years. “She’s someone I’d always aspired to work with,” he explains. “She’s been very supportive in recent years.” Before the World Cup in 2014, <a href="http://clintoncargill.4ormat.com/">Clinton Cargill</a>, then associate photo editor at <em>The New York Times Magazine</em> (and now photography director at <em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em>) contacted him about doing multiple-exposure images of some leading soccer players. Coulter had only a few minutes with each player, but managed to capture enough frames for his multiple-exposure technique, and some video. The results were published as a package both in print and on <em>The New York Times </em>website.  </p>
<p>The multiple-exposure work he’s done with athletes lead directly to a recent assignment from <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> to photograph the cast of <em>The Walking Dead </em>(doing zombie walks). That story, in turn, has landed Coulter work for other entertainment clients. Editorial work, Coulter notes, remains his best promotion, demonstrating to clients both his skills and his interests. “I’ve always felt that there are building blocks, and one thing leads to another,” he says. </p>
<p>Last fall he also got to photograph former president Bill Clinton for <em>The Atlantic</em>. The assignment—photographing multiple portraits in less than 10 minutes—was tricky, but Coulter says all his years photographing sports stars prepared him well. Coulter says professional athletes are among the most difficult subjects to shoot. Like many celebrities, they come to shoots with handlers and publicists who have thoughts about their clients’ public personae. Yet unlike actors, Coulter notes, “They’re not real comfortable in front of the camera.” And because he only has a few minutes with a busy athlete, Coulter says, “It’s taught me to elicit something from them quickly.” Shooting athletes, he notes, “has been a great training ground for all kinds of portraiture.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[In the letter introducing the first issue of <em><a href="https://californiasunday.com/">The California Sunday Magazine</a></em>, founding editor <a href="http://www.douglasmcgray.com/">Douglas McGray</a> notes that “most media gets made in New York.” This new monthly magazine, on the other hand, draws on California and the West for its perspective and sense of place. “The West is huge and fascinating and influential,” McGray writes. “We’re surrounded by great stories.”
<p>California and the West also have specific vibes and esthetics, which are reflected in <em>The California Sunday Magazine’s</em> subtle design and the primacy and space it gives to photography. As editorial clients go, California Sunday should excite a lot of photographers.</p>
<p>“We want to surprise readers with every issue,” says Jacqueline Bates, the magazine’s photography director. “<em>California Sunday</em> imagery feels cinematic, it’s bright; when we photograph people, we want to represent them in an authentic way, with an emphasis on place and setting. You won’t see a lot of stylized studio photography in the magazine.”</p>
<p>“Cinematic” is a buzzword the staff are using to describe the magazine’s photography. Creative director Leo Jung says that means they want to create a “sense of a narrative through a sequence of images” that accompany a story. To do this, they “give a lot of real estate to the photography,” Jung notes, and pay particular attention to the settings where the stories take place. “When we’re shooting subjects and portraits, it’s really important to see them in their own spaces or in the place where the story takes place,” Jung explains.</p>
<p>Another way the magazine achieves a cinematic feel is with a “two-beat cover,” meaning utilizing both a standard cover image and the inside front cover spread of the magazine. For instance, the magazine’s November issue, its second, featured a graphic, close-up <a href="http://fraenkelgallery.com/artists/richard-misrach">Richard Misrach</a> image of a woman standing behind a border fence that separates San Diego County and Tijuana, Mexico. The fencing forms a tight, square grid, through which the woman’s face and upper body are barely visible. On the inside front cover spread, readers saw a pulled-back photograph of the same fence, this one revealing its scale, the rusting steel posts that give it structure, and, in the foreground, what appears to be a blood stain on the stonework on the U.S. side of the border. “As soon as you turn the cover, there’s space for us to use the page to continue the story that we’re introducing on the cover,” Jung notes. “Instead of having words tell you what the story is about, we’re hoping…we can introduce the story through a sequence of images.”</p>
<p>In the case of the November issue, the cover story is about Misrach’s collaborative project with sound artist <a href="http://www.galindog.com/">Guillermo Galindo</a>, “Border Signs.” Since 2009, the pair have collaborated to create a body of work about the U.S.-Mexico border. The full exhibition and Aperture-published book won’t appear until 2016, but Misrach and Galindo chose to debut the work in <em>The California Sunday Magazine</em>. “The opportunity to work with the CSM people, as well as recent developments and pressure for political action regarding immigration, made us feel it was time to contribute to the dialogue,” Misrach told <em>PDN</em> via email.</p>
<p>The artists’ decision to debut the work in the magazine was appropriate—their collaboration began when they met at one of McGray’s Pop-Up Magazine gatherings, at which writers, photographers and others share stories with a live audience. It was from these popular events in San Francisco that <em>The California Sunday Magazine</em> emerged.</p>
<p>While it’s sold in select bookstores in the Bay Area, L.A., Portland and Seattle, the magazine is primarily distributed in Sunday editions of the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, <em>Los Angeles Times</em> and <em>Sacramento Bee</em>. (The first three issues were also distributed to select <em>New York Times</em> subscribers in California.) In designing the magazine, Jung considered the wide, diverse audience, as well as California’s laid-back attitude. An East Coast native who worked previously at <em>The New York Times Magazine</em> and <em>WIRED</em>, Jung says he “wanted to be able to capture what I felt like was a different vibe and essence on the West Coast.”  </p>
<p>For the “Shorts” section of the magazine—short articles that appear in the front of the book—Jung uses color gradation in the headlines as a “reflection of the different type of light” on the West Coast. He also chose a rounded slab serif for the magazine’s main typeface, which had “the serious qualities of the serif,” but could also feel lighthearted when he used the bolder versions of the typeface, which conveys “that sort of casualness of California.” Despite these subtle nods to region, Jung says he aims to keep the design “secondary” to the reader experience of the magazine and digital products. “The important thing,” he says, is to “enhance the experience whenever possible, but be a lot more subtle.”</p>
<p>“Leo’s design, and the simplicity and the elegance of it, really elevates the photography,” Bates notes. “He lets it breathe, whereas in many other magazines, you don’t always have the luxury of having all of these big, beautiful images.”</p>
<p>Misrach says he “loved” working with Jung, Bates and writer Kit Rachlis on the piece. “They came to my studio where they found a huge project (I have made over 12,000 photos thus far) and they were able to hone it down to a poignant essay. This was an amazing feat,” he enthuses, adding that Jung’s print layout “knocked my socks off.” In print, a panoramic image of a beach bisected by steel fencing was given a gatefold spread in the center of the magazine. The design for <em>California Sunday’s</em> digital editions, which they publish on their site and in smartphone and tablet apps, “was even better,” says Misrach. </p>
<p>The first issue of the magazine featured a <a href="http://www.hollyandres.com/">Holly Andres</a> photograph on its cover, which introduced a story about virtual reality. And <a href="http://brianfinke.com/">Brian Finke’s</a> portrait of chef Roy Choi ran on the cover of the December issue. “We’re trying to make these deliberate decisions to make each cover feel like it’s very different from the previous ones. And that’s part of being a really effective general interest magazine,” Jung notes.</p>
<p>Andres was the only photographer Bates thought of for the cover story about virtual reality, she says. Bates and Andres met in 2009 at the Photolucida portfolio reviews in Portland, OR. “Her images create such fantastical narratives that she was the perfect fit for what we were trying to achieve,” Bates explains.</p>
<p>While she plans to build a small roster of photographers she will regularly work with, Bates says she’s “very interested in also working with artists that haven’t shot for a magazine like ours before, from up-and-comers to established photographers.” Through the first three issues, Bates notes, they’ve worked with many female photographers, something she is “thrilled” about. Previously a photo editor for <em>W</em> and <em>Elle </em>magazines, Bates says she looks for photographers by paying attention to gallery shows, photo blogs and arts journals as well as Instagram. The magazine also features stories on Latin America and Asia, so her needs go beyond the region. She also relies on word of mouth from friends and photographers. She notes, “I've been seeing a new wave of photographers who are less competitive with each other and eager to share their friends' talents with me. The sense of community is really wonderful to see.’”</p>
<p>For a December story about a family clashing with a community of Mormon fundamentalists on the Utah/Arizona border, Bates hired <a href="http://www.jimmangan.com/home/photography/blast/">Jim Mangan</a>. “I was looking for an opportunity to have him shoot something along the lines of his otherworldly series of aerial photographs of Utah,” she recalls. Mangan was a fit for this story because it was “so much about the awe-inspiring landscape—which, when viewed from the outside, concealed a drama unfolding in the community,” Bates explains.</p>
<p><em>The California Sunday Magazine </em>also welcomes pitches from photographers, and from photographers and writers who’d like to work together on a story. “We’re really looking for stories that are beautiful and arresting,” Bates explains. “It can be a fully formed project or a work in progress, but we want it to be super special…we want all the photography to be unseen and unpublished.”</p>
<p>Creative freedom is one of the biggest advantages of working on a new magazine, Bates says. “Some photo editors can get stuck hiring the same photographers, because you know they can deliver, and there are such tight budgets and deadlines nowadays that you can’t afford to re-shoot if the edit comes back and doesn’t work. We don’t have the same pressure to fit into the tight constraints of an already established brand. We’re creating a visual language with each issue, from scratch. There is a sense of freedom in that. We can take chances. The best part of my job is commissioning photographers to experiment and challenge themselves.”</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<em>First impressions count, for portfolios as well as people. Clients, reviewers, competition jurors, and anyone else sizing up your portfolio will judge your work not just on its merits, but on the quality and care of the presentation. In the case of the Eugene Smith Foundation Grant, the quality of prints submitted by finalists is one of the criteria of the judging. This year, jurors praised not only <a href="/exports/galleries/How-I-Got-That-Grant-Joseph-Sywenkyj-On-Winning-The-2014-W-Eugene-Smith-Grant-12555.shtml">2014 Smith Grant recipient Joseph Sywenkyj’s project</a>, but also the quality of his printing and presentation. From an e-mail exchange with PDN about how he won the grant, here’s what Sywenkyj told us about creating a competition portfolio that was both exquisite—and affordable.</em><br />
<br />
<br />
I did work on the prints myself. I spent A LOT of time printing in the darkroom from negatives as a student at School of Visual Arts (SVA), where I studied under Jerry Vezzuso, who is a master color printer and a wonderful photographer. I also worked as a printer at a high-end lab called Exhibition Prints. There, I got to watch master printers make large traditional C-prints for photographers such as Joel Sternfeld. I know the craft that goes into making a high quality print and I respect it. <br />
<br />
This year I was in the USA when I found out I was a finalist for the Smith Grant and called around to a few labs in New York City to price out printing options for digital C-prints. It looked to be about $100 per print, depending on the lab and paper used, in an environment where I could sit and work directly with the printer. That would equal approximately $2,000 for 20 prints. The craft of printing high quality fine art style prints never goes that smoothly, so in reality I was easily looking at $3,000 or more just for prints. Add in a low to mid range custom-made clamshell case and bag and you are at about $4,000 already. That is a lot of money.<br />
<br />
Luckily, I had made digital C-prints in Ukraine for an exhibition I had at the Camera Club of New York last year, which is what I went with in the end [to make prints for the Smith Grant]. Why? Because it is a fraction of the price—about $7 per print--and I knew the quality would be just about the same. So, I [went] to Ukraine with my family, which I was already going to do anyway, and made the prints there. There were some issues, like limited time and running out of paper, but it worked out. <br />
<br />
I do all my own scanning and photoshop work, which consists of the basics that can be done in the darkroom: dodge, burn and contrast and color adjustments. <br />
<br />
They guy at the lab in Ukraine I was working with knows his stuff, but he is more of a technician than a fine art printer. He is not the type of person who will stare at a completely good looking photograph on a wall for 30 minutes as we discuss how best to bring more emotion out of the image by slightly burning here, slightly dodging there, possibly removing 2% of green and maybe adding a bit of warmth. The people who take printing photographs seriously will understand this lunacy. <br />
<br />
I did the vast majority of the work, but he knows his monitor and machines better than I do so he would make some very minor adjustments from time to time. He thought I was crazy to reprint photographs where I would make the slightest corrections, but that attention to detail can make a huge difference in the final print.  <br />
<br />
I then returned to New York to pick up my custom made portfolio [case] and put the finishing touches on the presentation (captions, labels, etc) in New York City. I could have saved more money [by] shipping the prints and asking a friend to simply place them in the box and drop it off [at International Center of Photography, where jurors convene to select the Smith Grant winner], but I wanted to make sure everything was flawless. <br />
<br />
When presenting prints in the past, dating back to my time as a student, I used an 8x10” Century presentation clamshell box and a padded Tenba portfolio bag. This is simple and relatively inexpensive and I sometimes still use this set-up.<br />
<br />
I basically took the same approach this year, except I ordered a custom-made 16x20” clamshell presentation box and padded case from Brewer-Cantelmo. I went there in person to view options and make the order.  [I had] my name debossed on the top on the box so when you opened the case it was obvious that the box was meant to open from left to right, like a book. All of my images were printed in a vertical fashion to match this. No color was added to the debossing. It is black, just like the box, [and] completely visible, but a bit understated, which was [intentional].<br />
<br />
The captions were printed on good quality paper with color thumbnail [images]. I included three copies, one for each judge. This style of caption presentation was chosen so the judges could view the photographs and read the captions at the same time. I am not the first person to do this, but it is simple, effective and works well. It had the feel of how captions are presentation in a gallery. <br />
<br />
I did not put anything between the prints to protect them, as dealing with protective sheets would be a distraction and would likely annoy the judges. I was also sure they would take care of the prints anyway. However, I did place 3 pairs of white gloves inside and secured them along with the captions sheets so the judges would see them right away when they opened the box before even seeing the prints.  <br />
<br />
I wanted a simple uninterrupted flow with the presentation of my photographs so that all of the focus went into the project and proposal. Just like a photographers kit, simplicity is bliss. <br />
<br />
[When] I dropped my portfolio off at ICP, I did one final once-over in a class room before handing it over after I said a prayer. <br />

    <article_text><![CDATA[Adult depictions of childhood are often nostalgic. Freedom, discovery and a sense of wonder are all common themes as grown-ups recall the more innocent world of youth. While the difficulties of childhood are by no means ignored by the popular consciousness, the experience of being a kid is vastly more complicated than we generally want to remember. And it doesn’t help that children have to navigate a world created by adults who may or may not have reconciled the difficulties of their own childhoods.
<p>Photographer <a href="http://www.cynthiahenebry.com/">Cynthia Henebry’s</a> ongoing series, <a href="http://www.cynthiahenebry.com/the-marriage-oaks/">“The Marriage Oaks,”</a> seeks to tap into the “relationship between the chaos and conflict that exists in the adult world and the internal life of the child,” she explains in her artist’s statement. Using a 4x5 camera, Henebry collaborates with kids to create images that exist in a space between childhood and adulthood; “between the children and me, then and now, truth and metaphor,” she writes. The images unpack some of the complexity of growing up. In the series, her portraits are interspersed with details and landscapes that depict her subjects’ environments.</p>
<p>The idea that “childhood becomes this foreign place” when people pass into adulthood is of particular interest to Henebry. “Both the research and the experiential aspects of making the work explore the idea that the child is fundamentally ‘Other’ to the adult,” Henebry writes in her statement. “The images attempt to articulate the consequences of this fundamental and universal disconnect.”</p>
<p>In some ways the work is leading Henebry on a path of self-discovery. Her own challenging childhood experiences, which include navigating her parents’ divorce and other intense family relationships, are part of the impetus for the work, and the series title refers to the trees that grew on her mother’s family property. The photographs, she explains, are a combination of self-portraiture and fiction. The reason she is instinctively drawn to photograph certain children, and the choices she makes when photographing and editing, are reflections of her experience. “Sometimes [the images] are really hard to make or to look at, because in a way I’m making work about the part of myself that is hard to look at,” she tells <em>PDN</em> from Richmond, VA, where she lives with her family. “Claiming the self-portraiture aspect of it is my way of protecting [my subjects] also,” she adds.</p>
<p>In some images, the kids seem to be looking intently above or to the side of the viewer, at what, we can only guess. In one picture, a shirtless boy laying on a dark blanket with his hands tucked behind his head and arms akimbo seems consumed with something above him, out of the frame. A small, dark-haired girl, who appears tiny in the backseat of a station wagon in another photograph, stares off-camera with piercing blue eyes, her look at once curious and wary. In other photographs, Henebry’s subjects look directly at the photographer and viewer, compelling us to wonder what they see.</p>
<p>Because she collaborates with her subjects to create the images, she doesn’t consider them documentary. “The pictures are these fictions we’re creating,” she says. The seriousness of her subjects, which they choose to express naturally, she adds, isn’t suggestive of their actual lives. The kids are “all really happy,” she says. “They are not these miserable children. Do they have loss in their lives? Yes. Does every human being have loss? Yes.”</p>
<p>Henebry, who graduated this year with an MFA from the University of Richmond, began the project in 2012 by photographing her friends’ daughters. Later she started to approach children in public that she was drawn to, and to ask the kids and their parents for permission to photograph them. Thus far, everyone has said yes, which is “really moving to me,” she says. </p>
<p>To create the work, she makes appointments to go and spend time with children in and around the homes they live in. “That’s where the charge is for me,” she says. She looks for a space with a light and form that interests her, then watches her subject. “I watch for what gestures are innate to them, and when I see it I know it, and I might say, ‘Can you hold that?’” Interestingly, the children Henebry has chosen have turned out to be, like herself, children of divorce. She downplays that aspect of the project, however, because she “doesn’t want it to be reductive.”</p>
<p>She learns something from each shoot, she says, thanks in part to the process of working with the 4x5. The camera creates an “experience of being with another human being in a deep way,” she explains. As she’s worked, her pictures have guided her thinking about the series and about childhood. “The pictures are teaching me,” she says.</p>
<p>Lately she’s thought about the idea that parents and other people in the lives of children “belong to them,” but children don’t belong to their parents or anyone else. “They belong to the universe, they belong to the cosmos,” she says. Henebry wants to explore how the relationships that children have beyond the home, beyond people, with the universe, ultimately support them in the world. “I hope the pictures will take me there,” she says. “How do you tap into that source of strength that can help you endure whatever is going to come your way?”</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[The opportunity to teach photography on the college level has traditionally been one of the incentives to earning an MFA. But art schools are now replacing secure tenure track teaching positions with overworked, underpaid adjunct instructors. And the changes raise important questions: Is teaching photography still a viable career option? Are adjunct professors serving the best interests of MFA students? And do recent MFA graduates consider their investment in their educations worthwhile?
<p>The traditional career path of artist/educator has provided many photographers with the security of a steady income as well as the space and support to create their own work. Many of the world’s greatest artists have taught at one time or another, from <a href="http://www.uelsmann.net/">Jerry Uelsmann</a>, who was at the University of Florida for nearly 40 years, to <a href="http://www.gagosian.com/artists/gregory-crewdson">Gregory Crewdson</a>, who is currently the director of graduate studies for photography at Yale University. But as the system of post-secondary education faces growing financial pressure brought about by changes in demographics, demand, and financial aid policy, art schools across the country are trying to balance budgets by replacing full-time, tenure track teaching positions with part-time, adjunct teaching positions—a controversial change that is affecting photography students’ experiences and the livelihoods of photography professors.</p>
<p>Some believe the increase in the proportion of adjunct (part-time) professors has helped dismantle a wall between the educational environment and the real world of working photographers. In New York, The School of Visual Arts’ photography department is staffed entirely by an adjunct faculty, and has been for some time. Department chair <a href="http://stephenfrailey.com/">Stephen Frailey</a> argues this is a great benefit to young photographers who are able to gain access to industry movers and shakers before leaving the classroom. “[SVA] students are learning from a network of professionals—photographers, picture editors, curators—who are helping to shape the conversation about the medium outside of academia,” Frailey told <em>PDN</em>. “Their education is more on-topic, and creates an invaluable dialogue, a pollination, between both communities.” </p>
<p>In other words, the churn of an adjunct faculty arguably creates an environment where students not only benefit from exposure to a variety of perspectives and experience, but also gain access to broader professional networks than permanent full-time faculty can provide. </p>
<p>The other side of that argument is that those part-time professors are often stretched thin by other work, and have less time and availability for students outside of class or throughout their academic and professional careers. <a href="http://www.seanjustice.com/">Sean Justice</a> remembers working at as many as five different schools per semester prior to landing a full-time position as Coordinator of the Myers Media Art Studio at Columbia University. “When adjuncting, I was never able to be involved in the evolution of the students as an artist,” he recalls. Hopping from location to location, Justice noted that he lacked the bandwidth to follow through with students in their growth and development.  </p>
<p>Rebecca Nolan, Chair of Photography at Savannah College of Art and Design, warned that with too many adjunct positions, the quality of the students’ education can start to suffer as the curriculum becomes inconsistent. Schools also run the risk of having teachers who won’t take their positions seriously due to low pay and a lack of connection to the school. “If it is a visiting artist brought in for one quarter, the impact as a mentor can be great,” Nolan argues. But long-term adjuncts, she says, become less involved as it becomes clear they aren’t going to be offered a full-time position. “Why should they give back or give more than teaching their class?” Nolan wonders, adding that adjuncts often “do not have time to be more involved due to other career obligations.”</p>
<p>This creates a complicated landscape for the school and students, but especially for the adjunct faculty, who generally earn between $2,500 and $5,000 per class per semester with no benefits.  </p>
<p>The four adjuncts interviewed for this article all described the difficulty in piecing together a living from part-time teaching opportunities in any given city. Some adjuncts noted traveling to as many as three states per week to fill their teaching schedules. <a href="http://www.kristinasmithfineart.com/">Kristina Smith</a>, who is currently an adjunct at three schools, estimates that she commutes 500 miles per week between jobs, and spends more time in her car than in the classroom. Adjuncts interviewed for this article also noted having to supplement their incomes to survive in even a meager way. One adjunct reported making as little as $10,000 a year despite teaching 3–5 classes per semester, which is a heavy load by academic standards. </p>
<p>As a result, many adjuncts with MFAs are making ends meet by turning to other types of jobs, from real estate, to retail work and even food delivery. “It’s really hard to maintain a professional persona when you have to worry if you are going to deliver take-out to one of your students,” adds Smith, who worked as a delivery person in addition to teaching. Such circumstances also leave little time, resources and emotional space for an artist to create their own personal work. </p>
<p>Adjunct professors are beginning to address the issue by forming unions on college campuses. Part-time faculty at Maryland Institute College of Art recently banded together to increase exposure for adjunct issues and to petition for greater benefits. As a result of Adjunct Action, a movement Organized by the Service Employees International Union, or SEIU, some schools have improved not just adjunct pay, but also retirement benefits, evaluation procedures and job security. Although such improvements in work conditions are rare, unions are making waves and many schools are taking note.</p>
<p>Despite the stress and job insecurity in the current teaching market, none of the adjuncts interviewed for this article expressed regret about their decision to get MFA degrees. “I would do it all over in a heartbeat,” says photographer and adjunct <a href="http://meggriffithsphotography.com/">Meg Griffiths</a>. ”It’s the only time you have to completely devote to yourself and your work. It is a sweet and hard time, but it is worth every second and penny you spend.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Among the most prestigious and competitive grants available to photojournalists is the <a href="http://smithfund.org/">W. Eugene Smith Grant in Humanistic Photography</a>, won this year by photographer <a href="http://www.josephsywenkyj.com/">Joseph Sywenkyj</a> for his multi-faceted project about the Ukraine. 
<p>Called “Verses from a Nation in Transition,” the project encompasses 15 years of documenting the day-to-day life of a family affected by HIV; a series of portraits of Ukrainians confined to hospitals and orphanages with tuberculosis and other diseases; and images of the country’s recent political unrest and invasion by Russia.</p>
<p>Sywenkyj had been a finalist for the grant in 2009 and 2011. In all, he says, he’s applied for it “probably 8 or 10 times.” But his win this year is about more than mere persistence. He spent weeks refining his written application, but more importantly, his winning portfolio reflected a deep, intense commitment to his subjects and project.</p>
<p>“What really stood out for me…is the extremely high level of intimacy, intensity and emotion conveyed through his photographs,” says Stuart Alexander, one of the 2014 jurors. </p>
<p>“He takes [subjects’] micro stories, and tells macro stories through them. That’s incredibly hard to do,” says Dora Somosi, another juror. “His life and his pictures are so intertwined. That’s what makes [the images] soulful and poignant.”</p>
<p>The purpose of the W. Eugene Smith Grant is to “recognize a photographer who has demonstrated an exemplary commitment to documenting the human condition in the spirit of Smith’s concerned photography and dedicated compassion.” </p>
<p>The guidelines, says Somosi, are “pretty specific. The grant shouldn’t be for work that is already completed. It shouldn’t be for [funding] a book or exhibitions. It’s really about making more images.” For applicants, that requires a balancing act: “Projects have to be coherent enough for us [jurors] to see where it’s going, but still have a place to go,” Somosi says. </p>
<p>She adds that a surprising number of applicants eliminate themselves by apparently not reading the guidelines, and stating in their applications that they are applying for the grant because they’ve finished a project, and need money to produce a book or mount an exhibition. </p>
<p>Jurors also consider the quality of portfolio prints, which only finalists are asked to submit for the second round of judging. Print quality is important, Somosi explains, because once Smith grant recipients complete their projects, they are required to send prints for inclusion in the Memorial Fund’s archive at the <a href="http://www.icp.org/">International Center of Photography</a> in New York City. “Joseph’s prints were incredible,” Somosi says. (See here for details about how he made his museum-quality prints for an affordable price.)</p>
<p>Sywenkyj, a former <em>PDN’s</em> 30 photographer, says he spent about two weeks working exclusively on his editing, printing, and written proposal. “I knew I needed time to reflect on recent events in Ukraine as they were, and still are, in a state of tremendous transition,” he told <em>PDN </em>in an email interview.</p>
<p>The core of his project has been his work about a family living with HIV. Sywenkyj says when he started the project in 2001, he was “tired of seeing (and also making) images of people with HIV/AIDS that were so dire. I wanted to document the normal side of life, beyond the illness.” He has spent so much time documenting one family that he’s practically become one of the family members. “It is just basic family life,” he says of the images. Dramatic events are rare, but the images are rich with emotion and gesture. </p>
<p>For the grant, he proposed documenting the stories of several other families. “I will document how they adapt to the complex repercussions of the revolution and Russian supported war against their nation,” he says.</p>
<p>Like previous Smith grant recipients, Sywenkyj reached out to colleagues for feedback on his written proposal. He got help from one friend in particular. “She used to help me edit my work in college [at School of Visual Arts] and still helps me from time to time,” he says. “She knows my work and me very well.”</p>
<p>When he sent her a first draft of his proposal, “she did exactly what a good friend does and tore it to shreds. This did not upset me. It energized me,” he says. “She knew I was holding a lot back” in the grant proposal, he says.</p>
<p>The process, he says, forced him to think more deeply about what was happening in Ukraine “and how I felt about it on a personal level. It was all up in my head, but I had not put it down on paper.” </p>
<p>Previous Smith grant winners also emphasize the importance of explaining in the written proposal what your work is about, why it matters, and how you plan to continue it. <a href="http://www.robinhammond.co.uk/">Robin Hammond</a>, who won the grant last year for his work on the issue of mental health in African countries in crisis, says several 2014 Smith grant applicants approached him for feedback and advice on their proposals.</p>
<p>“A lot of people write a lot about the issue [they are focusing on], and sometimes too much, in a complicated way, and not nearly enough about how they’re going to document it. The jury needs to know what they’re going to see” as a result of awarding someone a grant, Hammond says.</p>
<p>In his own Smith grant application, he says, he explained how he was influenced by Smith’s work, and emphasized that he was trying to continue in Smith’s tradition of humanistic photography. </p>
<p>“I made clear that I had been working on the project for several years, and that I was trying to give voice to people who hadn’t been represented in the media fairly. We report on disasters and leave. My work was about staying longer,” Hammond says. Having already documented the human rights abuses of mental patients and published a book, Hammond had to convince jurors there was still work to be done. He explained in his application that he intended to expand the project by going back to document healthcare workers and patient advocates “who are trying to make a difference,” he says.</p>
<p>Hammond says one of the challenges for many photographers—including well-known photojournalists whose applications he’s read—is learning how to write about their work intelligently and clearly in a grant application. The way to learn, he says, is to apply for a lot of grants. “That forces you to articulate what you’re trying to do.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.krisannejohnson.com/">Krisanne Johnson</a>, who won the grant on her third attempt in 2011 for her project about how Swaziland’s culture puts young women at high risk of spreading HIV/AIDS, also says she learned to communicate clearly about it by applying for a lot of grants. (She won a <a href="http://imagery.gettyimages.com/getty_images_grants/">Getty Editorial Grant</a> and <a href="http://emergencyfund.magnumfoundation.org/">Magnum Foundation Emergency Fund</a> grant before winning the Smith grant.)</p>
<p>“Before you sit down to write” a grant application, she advises, “have a conversation about your project with a friend. Vocalize it. It makes you realize what’s not clear to others.” </p>
<p>As important as the written proposal is, the strength of the application ultimately depends upon the strength of the work. Sywenkyj says, “I would advise people to concentrate on making photographs that mean something to them first. Applying for grants is important, as funds are needed to pursue long-term projects, but the photographs and the story comes first. It is very important to be honest with yourself about why you choose a particular subject matter, person or place.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Like many young people, Rosalind Carter and Rob Salazar dream of escaping their old neighborhood by succeeding in the music business. Carter, who records as Rozo, and Salazar, known as Galli, were born and raised in Watts, the south Los Angeles district with one of the highest rates of violent crime in the city and more public housing than any urban area west of the Mississippi. They began making music together at Locke, a charter high school, releasing some videos and EPs, but their lives have diverged as they strive in their own ways to get ahead. They tell their stories through their music and voice-overs in <a href="http://audiovision.scpr.org/334/south-of-stars">“South of Stars,” a video produced, directed and edited by Mae Ryan and Grant Slater for KPCC</a>, a public radio station in southern California. Ryan and Slater followed Carter and Salazar periodically for four months, recording intimate interviews, video of their day-to-day lives and evocative imagery of people and places they live amongst in Watts. Says Slater, “The neighborhood is a really important character in the story.” 
<p>Ryan and <a href="http://www.grant-slater.com/">Slater</a> shot photographs and video for the KPCC’s website while on staff at the station. They produced short documentaries for an online program that Slater launched called Audio Vision, which presented films “that had the feel of public radio stories.” Ryan had long wanted to do a story about people in Watts, where jobs are scarce and crime remains among the highest in Los Angeles, even though the crime rate has improved in recent years. She found an article in <em>LA Weekly</em> about Rozo and Galli, who had won a competition for high school musicians. She looked up their YouTube videos, and liked Carter’s raps about her life. She also thought the friendship between Carter, who is African-American, and Salazar, whose family comes from Mexico, represented a microcosm of changes in Watts. The traditionally African-American neighborhood has in recent years become home to many Latinos. “They’re not just fighting each other,” Ryan says of the two groups. “If you come from a similar place, you do have a lot in common.” </p>
<p>The first time Ryan and Slater met with Carter and Salazar, they didn’t bring cameras. “We just had long talks with both of them, and got to know them,” Ryan recalls. They learned that Salazar was leaving Watts each day to commute to Santa Monica College, work, and record music, while Carter, who lives at her grandmother’s house with several other family members, was a neighborhood fixture, known to everyone on her block. They decided that Ryan would follow Carter, Slater would follow Salazar, and when the two subjects got together to record music, the filmmakers would be shooting at the same time. They planned to incorporate Rozo and Galli music into the story. They wanted the project to look cinematic, like a music video, Ryan says, “but provide a back story.” </p>
<p>Rather than shoot footage first and recording audio on the fly, Ryan and Slater recorded audio interviews and then used their subjects’ words and stories to guide what they would shoot. They recorded the interviews using only radio mics and Marantz recorders—no video. “Our goal was never to show the interview shot—ever,” says Slater. The typical talking-head interviews in documentaries “tend to take you out of the story,” Ryan says. They interviewed each of the subjects three times, and each time gained more useful insights. Ryan says the best quotes in the video came on her third interview when, needing a quiet place to record audio, she and Carter sat in Ryan’s car. Carter provided thoughtful reflections about the difficulties she had being accepted as a gay woman in the world of hip-hop.  </p>
<p>“You get more intimate interviews without a camera,” Slater says. “Everyone in the ’hood feels like they have to be tough in public.” It’s easier to get past that, he says, “with just a mic and not a camera in their face.” </p>
<p>The interviews helped Ryan and Slater develop shot lists. One of the first times Ryan shot video, she accompanied Carter’s family to church, where she recorded Carter singing in front of the congregation. Both the family and the congregation appreciated the visit, and Ryan was invited into the home where Carter sleeps on the living room couch, amidst the comings and goings of other family members. </p>
<p>To show the parallels and contrasts in the two main characters’ lives, Ryan and Slater followed them in similar situations: Walking to a train, for example, that they took in different directions, or spending time with their girlfriends. In one evocative scene, Carter and her girlfriend sit in a diner while they talk about what Carter is striving to achieve. </p>
<p>Ryan and Slater also gathered atmospheric footage of neighborhood life: Salazar’s dog playing, desolate stretches of sidewalk near public housing, people walking and joking on the street. While shooting handheld with Canon 5D Mark IIIs, they recorded much of the footage in slow-motion. “If you do slow-mo, you don’t have to worry as much about being steady when you’re shooting,” Slater explains. “We wanted it to look like it was shot on a huge budget.” The slow motion also enhances the storytelling by letting the viewer linger on certain images: “There were a lot of tender moments, and I thought they were emphasized more in that way,” Ryan explains. </p>
<p>When it was time to edit, Ryan (who acted as the primary editor) says, “We went through and picked out the best quotes they gave us, and then decided what’s the best narrative arc.” She used the quotes to draft a script which Slater then revised. She edited individual scenes, then planned the sequencing. </p>
<p>She says the story began falling into place once she cut the opening. They tried different sequences, and originally had a long voice-over by Ryan giving statistics about the community’s problems, but scrapped it. Slater says, “It sounded like every other story about white people going to a black neighborhood and talking about crime.” Ryan came up with a new opening that set up the parallel structure for the video: Over a plaintive Rozo and Galli song, Salazar is heard to say, “It’s destiny that you’re born here, but it’s not destiny that you stay here,” then Carter says, “This place doesn’t dictate my destiny.”</p>
<p>Rozo and Galli’s recordings provide a soundtrack that sets the tone of different scenes. In the final stages of editing, Slater paid close attention to pacing the cuts to work with the beats of the music. Blending ambient recordings of Carter’s live rapping into more polished recordings was Slater’s favorite part of the editing, he says. </p>
<p>Slater and Ryan left KPCC in 2014; Slater is a freelance director, and Ryan moved to New York City to work on staff at <em>The Guardian</em>. They remain in touch with their subjects, who are continuing their studies—Salazar at community college, Carter in a program to get her high school diploma—and continuing to make music that expresses their desires to move forward.</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Creative agency <a href="http://www.codeandtheory.com/">Code and Theory</a> was founded by childhood friends Brandon Ralph and Dan Gardner in 2001. After operating primarily as a digital design firm—some of their earliest work was designing websites for photographers—the company, which was named an “Agency to Watch” by Advertising Age in 2014, has grown to employ 300 people based in New York, San Francisco, London and Manila. As their name suggests, Code and Theory boasts a culture in which creatives and digital engineers work together to produce everything from websites for media brands like <em>Vogue</em> and the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, to ad campaigns for major brands like Burger King&reg; and Maybelline New York. <em>PDN</em> recently spoke with Ralph—a photographer in his own right—about creating an agency for the digital age; about the importance of crosspollination of art and technology; and about how Code and Theory works with photographers.
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What defines Code and Theory as an agency?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brandon Ralph: </strong>At Code and Theory, we’ve built a synchronized ecosystem of disciplines—brand design, product design, and a new discipline that overlaps both: industrial design.</p>
<p>We define product design as anything where the digital product is the business itself—like a publisher website. Brand design is about helping brands tell their stories and designing the systems that carry them—from 360 degree marketing campaigns to real-time response initiatives in social media. Our industrial design practice was born out of our desire to connect everything—designing the physical object, creating the interactions around it, and telling the story about it, all from the same point of inspiration.</p>
<p>Thirty percent of our agency is engineers, which means we develop, implement and manage almost all of the stuff we create. For the past 13 years, we’ve built a creative agency for the entire ecosystem, and are continually improving our model and approach.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How does having so many engineers on staff inform the creative work you do?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BR:</strong> We like to say that the engineers are on the creative team. How can you really be creative if you don’t know what’s possible? The engineers facilitate knowing what is possible from all technologies. Innovation is really interpreting what those technologies can be used for. We’ve created Google Maps driving games and reinterpreted what that API [application programming interface] was really meant for. That’s only because the engineers were in the room at the time as part of the creative process. How they’re doing real-time prototyping with us, how they’re brainstorming with the strategists and creative team and writers as one team—I think that differentiates us.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What do your clients expect from you as an agency?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BR: </strong>We’re not great order takers. We like to collaborate and understand our clients’ businesses and provide very pragmatic, realistic things. We’ve been embedded in 53 newsrooms in the last five years [working on projects], so that gives us an insight into how people publish news and content. If Maybelline wants to start acting like a publisher, we know what’s involved. We have a wide variety of expertise in all these different verticals. Some of our competitors are amazing designers, but don’t understand how to strategically create ad products to complement the nice website they just built, or understand how to integrate pathing to circulate users through a site.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What prompted your expansion from a digital design shop into a full-fledged agency?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BR:</strong> My business partner Dan Garder always screams this from the mountains: We only want to be limited by our own creativity. So we’ve wanted to continue to build out services. For a long time agencies [have been] siloed, and Dan and I believe the pendulum is going to swing back and clients are going to want everything consolidated again. To stay competitive, to remain a leader, we’re investing in all these different skill sets to make sure we can offer those services.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What have been the biggest challenges you’ve faced during that growth process?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BR: </strong>It’s part patience, it’s part trying to align ourselves with clients who want to take risks and believe in us. We’ve successfully hired people to prove to our existing clients who we want to be, and they’ve slowly given us a little bit. We’ve chosen the work we go after and the clients we want to pitch for the services we want to sell, versus just chasing revenue. That’s the great part about being independent: If you’re just chasing revenue, you’re not necessarily going to get the jobs that you want, you’re just going to get work. If we believe in content creation, we’ll go after jobs to build content creation [services]. It’s investing in the work, investing in the people, and the rest just happens.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Are there visual qualities that today’s consumers respond to?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BR:</strong> People always respond to good design. It doesn’t need to be the Chanels and Bottega Venettas and <em>Vogues</em> of the world. Any brand could have good design if they hire good designers. There are trends, but as an agency we’re not known for anything specific besides good design. We’re always trying to do what’s appropriate for the brand. I do believe that people respond to good design and it’s important that everything falls into a system.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: When you say good design do you mean visually, or in terms of the user experience?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BR:</strong> Everything. That everything is intuitive, thoughtful, intentional. Don’t do something just for the sake of doing it. Everything needs to have a reason. </p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: The general public’s visual standards are increasing and good design is a baseline. How do you as an agency continue to set yourself apart when good design is more and more common?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BR: </strong>It’s coming up with new and innovative ways to present content and storytelling, and I think that we’ve done an amazing job of continuing to innovate and set trends in the market for how we’re presenting content. On the product side, publishing it in a way that productizes content and paths users through websites, and on the brand side it’s storytelling and using our learning from our work with publishers. We’re interesting in that sense. The advertisers are hiring us to create these experiences on the publisher sites, and the publishers are hiring us to create experiences for the advertisers, so we have an insight that very few agencies have, working with as many brands and as many publishers as we have.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How are you using and thinking about photography in digital work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BR:</strong> I think that speed is as important as the image. Today you have to move at that speed of culture and get it out there. It’s that nuance. I don’t think everyone crafts every single word on a Tweet, but I think it’s about being timely and being on-culture and being on-topic. I think that images are kind of similar. Being the first is more important than, “Did they Photoshop or adjust the contrast enough?” The first [person] there is going to be just as important as everything else. If you’ve missed the moment and you’re not trending, does it matter?</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What types of photography are you commissioning?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BR:</strong> It’s everything: On <a href="http://city.maybelline.com/">Maybelline CITY</a>, which is essentially a a monthly fashion blogazine, we commissioned the <a href="http://city.maybelline.com/neon-lights/get-the-look/">“Get the Look”</a> feature, which is a step-by-step narrative about the products and creative ways to apply them. And then we’ve done stuff for nail polish company essie, which is photography featuring real polish on real nails, which is surprisingly rare in the beauty category. So we handle everything from creating images that can be out tomorrow, to commissioning a major three- or five-day shoot, and everything in between.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Do you have a producers and photographers on-staff?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BR:</strong> Yes, we have people internally to shoot content that works for everything from traditional ads to social images. We also have a production team that will bring talent in. </p>
<p>We definitely don’t want to be the agency that staffs all the people. The best model is hiring the best people for the job, but investing for the stuff that you can do around the house. There is a lot of stuff I could fix in my own house, but if it’s broken I’m going to call a contractor. I think the same philosophy exists for talent. We’re going to need someone to shoot big, anthemic campaigns. If we need someone to shoot looks for hands—it’s such an art to hire a hand photographer—we’ll hire the best person. We’re very pragmatic; we don’t want to try to own everything.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: You got behind the camera yourself for the “Big Eyes” campaign Code and Theory created for Maybelline. What is your background in photography?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BR:</strong> I’ve been shooting since I was a kid. I’ve been a Leica and rangefinder aficionado. I went to a school for fine arts, I was always doing drawing, painting or shooting. But I mainly loved photojournalism and street photography.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What are your big sources for visual inspiration?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BR:</strong> Everything in life. Everyone asks us what online inspires us. And I can honestly say nothing. I pull all my cues from architecture, design, function, like how drawers and cabinets open and close. Mechanisms. I walk a different way to work every single day just to soak up how people are paying attention to things in real life. I know it’s kind of a bullshit, cheesy answer, but it’s the truth for me.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: When you look at a photographer’s book, what are you looking for?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BR:</strong> Editing your book in a way to really show your best work. People are shooting more than ever given the breadth of work that’s needed across all these different digital platforms, so how do you actually show that versatility? You want to show your range, but then if you show too much it’s like, ‘Ok, I get it.’ That’s the balance: having the confidence in your own work to tell the story, and the breadth of work that you can do, without showing everything. Your work should be able to get someone to call you without showing everything, and then when you get a meeting you can show them the breadth of work. We go through a lot of books, and you can get fatigued very quickly if books are too long. </p>
<p>It’s the hardest thing to be your own editor. Nowadays, people will shoot thousands of images, so the art is in the selection.</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[For the indigenous women of the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador, the fight to protect the environment is not motivated by idealism. Rather, it is a matter of life and death. Their ancestral lands are in danger of being destroyed by state-run oil companies. After a proposed international effort to raise money to protect the lands was deemed a failure, the oil companies were given permission to drill by Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa. In the process of building an infrastructure for drilling, these companies have already polluted the air and water and introduced new diseases to one of the most biodiverse regions in the world. (For example, 2.5 acres of land in the Yasuni National Park, one of the regions slated for extraction, is estimated to have more species of flora and fauna than the United States and Canada combined.)
<p>“I fight for my kids so they don’t have to suffer, so that their land continues to be fertile and free of pollution, so that our rivers continue to be clean so they can drink clean water,” inscribed Hueiya, a member of the Waorani community in the Yasuni, underneath a portrait taken of her by documentary photographer <a href="http://www.felipejacome.com/">Felipe J&aacute;come</a> for his series <a href="http://www.felipejacome.com/visual-testimonies/the-last-amazonas/">“Amazonas: Guardians of Life.”</a> “I fight for all children who are yet to be born on this earth.”</p>
<p>“These women are literally willing to die fighting for their cause,” J&aacute;come explained via Skype from Lebanon, where he now lives. A peripatetic soul, J&aacute;come travels around the world to document human rights issues. He has documented the dire conditions of migrant workers in Mexico and the lives of sexual abuse victims in Haiti. A native Ecuadorian educated at Johns Hopkins University, he first learned about the Amazonas while on a trip to Quito, where he was raised. The project was inspired by a compelling news report about 300 women from seven indigenous tribes who embarked on a protest march from the Amazon to Quito, which at an elevation of 9,350 feet is the highest capital city in the world. The women came with very little food or money, carrying their children, often sick from environment-related illnesses, J&aacute;come recalls. They did so without men because, as they told J&aacute;come, “[men] are easily bought off for a bottle of whiskey and some prostitutes.” “They were elegant, articulate, very stoic, very proud,” he says. “I wanted to capture their eyes and the strength of their faces.”</p>
<p>On January 14, four months after the march was over, he began contacting some of the women using the help of NGOs that worked with them. Because many of the women live deep in the jungle, he partnered with <a href="http://www.accionecologica.org/">Acci&oacute;n Ecol&oacute;gica</a> to apply for a $5,000 grant to hire charter flights to three villages. He met with the women in the community centers where they held their assemblies. At first, they were hesitant to trust him, but after seeing a similar series he did on Haitian rape survivors, they better understood his project. If they agreed to participate, he took tightly cropped black-and-white shots of the women’s faces using his DSLR in the leafy shaded areas next to the community center. He took care to focus on their faces because he didn’t want the portraits to be about the women’s ceremonial dresses or their jewelry. “I did not want to participate in the folklorization of indigenous peoples,” he explains.</p>
<p>J&aacute;come printed the images using a portable printer and asked his subjects to paint around the border with the natural dyes they use to paint their faces. Finally, he asked them to write an answer to the question, “Why are you fighting to defend the jungle?” beneath the photograph. If they were illiterate, friends or neighbors did the writing for them. Overall, the photographs took just five days to shoot, but the planning took more than six months.</p>
<p>In collaborating with the women, J&aacute;come hoped to create documents that won’t get lost in a world full of billions of images. “Growing up in the ’80s and ’90s in Latin America, I am part of a generation that is very conscious about the need to document in order to learn from our dark past, to establish what happened, the truth, so we can move towards reconciliation and beyond,” he explains. By not only taking portraits, but also using words inscribed directly from the hands of the women, he hopes to set his images apart. “The moment these women inscribed their testimonies, it stopped being about me, and became about them,” J&aacute;come says. The women, he says, are “extremely aware that the photos are a step in the vindication of their struggle.”</p>
<p>Although President Correa has refused to meet with the women, many of them recently returned to Quito on the one-year anniversary of the march to explain their ongoing resistance at universities and in public forums. Concurrently, J&aacute;come’s images were published in a three-page spread in <em><a href="http://www.elcomercio.com/">El Comercio</a></em>, the country’s largest newspaper. The series was also used by the San Francisco-based NGO <a href="http://amazonwatch.org/">Amazon Watch</a> to highlight the plight of the Amazonas. They showed the images at a panel discussion, “Women Leading Solutions on the Frontlines of Climate Change,” organized by <a href="http://wecaninternational.org/">The Women’s Earth and Climate Action Network</a> during <a href="http://www.climateweeknyc.org/">Climate Week</a> in New York City. The images continue to be used in Ecuador to raise money and awareness for the movement to defend the indigenous people and their lands, including at <a href="http://www.uasb.edu.ec/">Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var University in Quito</a>, as part of an exhibition on the environmental situation in Ecuador.</p>
<p>As happy as J&aacute;come is that the works have been widely shown, what he’s most excited about is the idea that they might inspire other photographers. “Now more than ever, photographers need to find a way to create documents that won’t get lost in the insurmountable noise of modernity.”</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[<strong>Client:</strong> <em>WIRED</em>
<p><strong>Photo Editor:</strong> Julia Sabot</p>
<p><a href="http://www.emilyshur.com/">Emily Shur</a>, a Los Angeles-based photographer whose clients include HBO, <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>, Dodge, Sprint and <em>The New Yorker</em>, has been called upon to photograph lots of actors and comedians. Whether she’s shooting a funny subject or a serious one, her goal is always to make a timeless, classic photo. “Even if there’s comedy in it, I like it to be lit well and well-composed. I want it to still be sophisticated,” she says. Her assignments have ranged from natural-light portraits to conceptual shots requiring numerous lights. She doesn’t rely on a go-to technique for assignments, she says. “I like figuring out what works best for that particular shoot.”</p>
<p>On a recent assignment for <em>WIRED </em>magazine’s fall TV preview, Shur photographed the comedians Jonah Ray and Kumail Nanjiani, stars of the Comedy Central show <em><a href="http://www.cc.com/shows/the-meltdown-with-jonah-and-kumail">The Meltdown With Jonah and Kumail</a></em>. They were reviewing trailers for new TV shows for the magazine’s September issue, so photo editor Julia Sabot told Shur the image should show them watching TV, but didn’t need to be dominated by a big TV set. The comedians themselves suggested the concept, Shur explains. “They actually came back with the idea: What if we were watching Saturday morning cartoons in our pajamas like when we were kids?” Shur wanted her image to convey a sunny morning, and chose to enhance the window light in the location where she was shooting. Her goal was to “not have it feel too lit, strobe-y or dramatic,” she says. </p>
<p><strong>Logistics</strong></p>
<p>Shur suggested the location: a house about 30 minutes from Los Angeles that is filled with period details from the 1970s. “It’s actually the house that was prominent in <em>Boogie Nights</em>,” she notes. “I could shoot for days in this house. Every room is just perfect for a picture.” A location scout contacted the owner, who negotiated a fee that fit the editorial assignment budget.  </p>
<p>Period furnishings and d&eacute;cor were already in place; prop stylist Kyle Kinsella brought along toys, a crocheted blanket, and breakfast for the actors to eat in the shot; Natalie and Giolliosa Fuller of <a href="http://www.sisterstyling.com/">Sister Styling</a> brought pajamas and the wardrobe for additional set ups.   </p>
<p>In directing her subjects, Shur says, she tries to provide specific details about the story being told. Some subjects, she says, need only brief instructions at the start of the shoot while others need reminding. With Ray and Nanjiani, she says, “It was their idea, and I knew they were game to have fun with it,” she says. She suggested ideas for shows they might be watching on TV, so she could photograph their reactions. As they tried out variations, she gave them feedback about what looked good in the camera. “That’s what the subjects are looking to the photographer for. They can’t see what I’m seeing, so they’re trying different things that they think can work and it’s my job to steer them in the direction of what looks good.” </p>
<p>When actors are enjoying a shoot, she says, it’s easy to get caught up in the moment, but it’s her job in directing a shoot to be attentive to details. “There have been shoots where I’ve thought, ‘That was an amazing shoot,’ and then I’ve come home and realized I wasn’t being as particular as I should have been about the framing or body language.” </p>
<p>She says that when she is making a funny photo, she pays attention to tone. “It’s really a delicate balance between a joke being visually readable and immediate, and not slapping you in the face, saying, ‘This is funny, right?’”</p>
<p><strong>Lighting</strong></p>
<p>The back of the house had large windows that let sunlight into the living room. “I liked the quality of it, but it wasn’t enough for the exposure I needed,” Shur says, so she decided to mimic the sunlight using a broad, soft light to camera left. “I wanted it to feel bright and airy, but I wanted it to have a direction,” Shur says. By using a light with diffusion, “the shadows aren’t too hard, and there’s not a dramatic fall off in the light.”</p>
<p>She hung a 6-foot square silk from C-stands, about six feet to the left of the couch where her subjects where sitting. Behind the silk, she placed a Profoto Pro 7 head on a stand, about 9–10 feet from the floor. While the silk provided some diffusion, she diffused the light further by using an old umbrella. The strobe was on a 1200-watt-second Profoto 782 pack, but because she wanted a soft, daylight look, “We were definitely not at full power,” she says. “If you overpower the ambient light completely, that’s when it starts to look lit and ‘strobe-y.’”  </p>
<p>For fill, she placed a second light about six feet high, over the camera, with a medium-sized Photek umbrella. “It’s a soft, not boring, flattering light,” Shur says. </p>
<p>In other setups, which <em>WIRED</em> used on its iPad edition, she created a nighttime scene by putting blueish gels on a bare head with a reflector just below the camera, so the actors appeared to be sitting in the glow of a TV. </p>
<p>Shur recently faced the similar challenge of creating realistic room lighting while creating promotions for the Fox show <em><a href="http://www.fox.com/the-mindy-project">The Mindy Project</a></em>. Shur spent a day shooting multiple portraits and scenes on several sets created on a sound stage. One ad, which Fox recently released, was based on a frame grabbed from a recent episode in which stars Mindy Kaling and Chris Messina are at home, watching TV together. Though the scene had romantic lighting, Shur needed the lighting in the ad to be “a little more snappy.” She used a strobe with a Fresnel attachment to light the two subjects, creating dramatic fall-off behind them. The Fresnel created “snappy shadows,” she says.</p>
<p>She used an extra-small gridded softbox at 6 feet high—about level with Shur’s camera—to illuminate Kaling. “I wanted her to pop in a very subtle way. In order to get that feeling, I had to give [Kaling] her own source because of the difference in skin tone between her and Chris Messina.” In a lamp to the right of the subjects, Shur swapped out the light bulb for a pen light (a small strobe), and wrapped it in a CTO gel to make its glow look warmer. Shur notes that she could have shot the lamp as a separate plate, then composited that into the main shot, but the effect of having light from the lamp fall on her subjects was more realistic when captured in-camera. </p>
<p><strong>Camera</strong></p>
<p>On the <em>WIRED</em> shoot, Shur used a Canon EOS 5D Mark III and a 50mm lens at f/8. She shot at 1/50 sec at ISO 400. When the budget allows, Shur likes to have a digital tech on set to organize her images and do color correction before she does her own post-production work on the images at home. </p>
<p>On the <em>WIRED</em> shoot, however, she was on her own. She shot to cards and then used Capture One to process and color-correct her images. </p>
<p>On the Fox shoot, she used a Hasselblad with a PhaseOne P65 back and 100mm lens, shooting tethered so the creatives and clients on the set could preview images. </p>
<p><strong>Post Production</strong></p>
<p>When a shoot has gone well, Shur says, she’ll typically send the client 20–25 images of each set up. For the <em>WIRED</em> shoot, she worked on the selected images at home, doing some color correction and retouching in Capture One. Once the editors made their choices, she sent the JPEGs with notes about some further post-production tweaks she wanted to Anna Glen of Wet Noodles, Shur’s long-time retoucher. Shur says, “Before we shoot, when we’re doing the estimate, I make sure I’m up front about the retouching cost and the turnaround time for the retoucher so that everyone’s on the same page.” </p>
<p>Her photo of Ray and Nanjiani appeared in the September issue of <em>WIRED</em>.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[California’s Central Valley is <a href="http://www.mattblack.com/">Matt Black’s</a> home. In this month’s Picture Story, he tells <em>PDN</em> about his recent work documenting this year’s drought in the region for <em>The New Yorker</em>, an assignment which followed a decade and a half photographing the land and the people who work there. Much of the United States’ food supply comes from the historically fertile region, but the locals and migrants who suffer through its periodic droughts are often ignored, their stories and suffering unheard. 
<p>Black’s dedication to giving voice to the voiceless echoes the work of another photographer who documented the region, Dorothea Lange. Lange’s 1930s photographs, commissioned by the Resettlement Administration and the Farm Security Administration, put human faces on the tragedy of poverty in the Great Depression. This Lange photo of Texas drought refugees encamped in Exeter, California, was taken in November of 1936, but the brutal honesty and compassion it communicates speaks to the work Black is making today in the same region.</p>
<p>“It was taken in my town, and for that reason it’s an important one to me,” he says. “The picture is nearly 80 years old, but it feels as present as today.”  </p>
<p>Black says he learned about Lange and her work early in his life. Her work taught him not just about photography, but also about the history of the place in which he lived. His childhood was multiple generations removed from the Great Depression, but the Central Valley was inexorably shaped by the economic collapse of the 1930s and the subsequent migration. “In the Central Valley, growing up, no one ever talked about the 1930s or how bad things were,” Black explains. “It was taken as fact, and more or less forgotten.”</p>
<p>Everyman stories from that time, like those illustrated in Lange’s photos, were not often discussed during Black’s childhood, but he still recognized their importance. Lange’s photos of starving refugees at a camp in Nipomo, California, directly led to the federal government sending thousands of pounds of food. As Lange’s experience indicates, the stories of the disenfranchised can have significant impact on people who are suffering.</p>
<p>Lange’s photos helped Black connect the valley’s history to his own, and her approach influenced how he would document the community and shine light on the stories of the regular, everyday people he lived amongst. “There is a deep and lasting importance in documenting and recording that,” he says. He is also quick to say that it’s the work, not the photographer that ultimately inspires change. </p>
<p>“She had clarity and knew 100 percent what her work was all about,” he says. “[But] it was Lange’s photographs that touched people, not her. She pushed on for years without any acclaim, because she believed in what she was doing. She did her work faithfully and with conviction and feeling. That’s how all of us should do this.”</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Wishing you could fly might be a common desire, but photographers working the angles of a shot probably wish for wings more fervently than most people. Being able to find new or unusual points of view can open up creative possibilities, and in today’s competitive market, having a fresh perspective can often lead to commercial success, as well. Enter the unmanned aerial vehicle, a.k.a. the drone. Now that using UAVs for image capture requires neither a small fortune nor extensive use of a soldering gun, many photographers have begun to recognize them as potential tripods in the sky.
<p>Unfortunately, the high-flying dreams of aerial drone photographers have been shot down by the Federal Aviation Administration’s prohibition on using UAVs for commercial purposes. While recreational use of drones is legal in the U.S., the FAA has put commercial use of drones on ice while the process of drafting regulations and licensing requirements moves forward. FAA watchers expect final regulations to be delayed for at least another year.</p>
<p>To find out how UAVs are being used commercially by photographers, we looked outside of the U.S. to Chile, where the British-born photographer <a href="http://www.mattwilson.cl">Matt Wilson</a> has been integrating drones into his toolkit. Wilson began working with UAVs in 2012, and his two collaborators pilot the drone and monitor the location for potential hazards while he captures images. </p>
<p>Wilson and his partners opted for a relatively large octocopter made by <a href="http://www.quadrocopter.com/">Quadrocopter</a>, which allows Wilson to mount heavier, more advanced cameras to the UAV. He often shoots with a Sony NEX-5 for stills or a compact Blackmagic Pocket Cinema camera for video, sometimes mounting a Pocket Wizard transceiver to trigger Elinchrom strobes on the ground. Wilson controls the camera position with a gimbal mount, and shoots while viewing a wirelessly transmitted live-viewfinder image on a monitor.</p>
<p>Because Wilson specializes in working with the location-oriented wine and hospitality industries, his clients are a natural fit for drone photography. Wilson has been hired to produce aerial shoots of vineyards, hotels, and even a shopping center under construction by clients who would have found the significantly higher cost of paying for a helicopter excessive. Using a drone also gives him more flexibility to get exactly the angle and type of shot his client wants. “I used to shoot a lot with helicopters,” he says, “and the main difference with a drone is that we can do a vertical shoot now, which gives a different perspective.” </p>
<p>Wilson licenses his aerial images to clients for use on websites, in brochures and in other marketing materials. He’s seen less direct demand from editorial clients, although some of his aerial images have made their way into magazines via his clients’ publicity packages. </p>
<p>Photographers in the U.S. are also seeing a demand for drone photography coming from industries that have a strong interest in promoting themselves with images of specific locations, such as real estate, construction and tourism. <a href="http://echengphoto.com/#!/index">Eric Cheng</a>, an experienced UAV photographer who is also the director of aerial imaging for drone manufacturer DJI, points to a demand for more technical types of UAV photography as well. “In any industry you can imagine wanting regular aerial imagery that’s registered and applied to a map, we’re seeing a ton of interest,” he says. They can include agriculture, construction monitoring, utility inspection, search and rescue and security, and clients are typically in need of multiple images of large areas—sometimes over extended periods—to monitor developments. </p>
<p>In Chile, Wilson has responded to the demand for technical imagery by adding an infrared camera to his kit. “We fly in a grid over a vineyard, for instance, which would cost tens of thousands of dollars in a helicopter but will cost a fraction of that with a drone,” he explains. “We can also do 3D mapping now. We fly back and forth shooting hundreds of stills, and then it can go into a computer and build a 3D map.” Wilson also gets frequent requests for aerial video, and many UAV image makers doing commercial work in countries where it’s legal offer both still and video services. </p>
<p>Of course, making aerial photography radically more accessible presents new creative options for photojournalists, as well as advertising, editorial and fine art photographers. Photographer <a href="http://www.visual-aerials.com/">Romeo Durscher</a> has enthusiastically embraced using UAVs to capture panoramic shots, including vertical panoramas shot from angles that would be impossible to achieve from the ground. Fellow drone enthusiast <a href="http://boltron.com/">Nate Bolt</a> even used a UAV for an interior imaging project—a motion shoot of the New York Public Library’s cavernous Stephen A. Schwarzman building. <a href="http://www.highton.com/">Scott Highton</a>—who is a licensed pilot with lots of experience in aerial shooting—uses drones in his personal work to create interactive panoramas. “There’s just something magical about aerial views,” he says. “It’s a different perspective, and that’s what we’re all seeking in our work—a way to show something in a unique manner.”</p>
<p>Getting into UAV imaging isn’t for creative dabblers, however. Photographers who want to use drones in their personal work or gear up for the legalization of commercial drone use should expect to invest a substantial amount of time in learning how to operate a UAV safely and skillfully. Wilson and his collaborators spent six months learning to operate their equipment and work together as a team, and another eight months doing their own shoots before taking a commercial job. They limit their aerial work to locations that they can scout beforehand, carefully control the proximity of their drone to people and constantly monitor the site for obstructions and other dangers. “If any kids come along, we just bring it down right away,” says Wilson. “We’re very strict with ourselves about that.”</p>
<p>One of the most common problems for novice UAV operators is the flyaway, in which a drone that hasn’t been calibrated properly isn’t able to locate its home base and simply flies off in a random direction instead of returning to the pilot. “In 99.9 percent of the cases when it does happen, it’s user error,” says Durscher. Both he and Highton recommend that photographers interested in drone photography learn the basics of calibration and control through online video tutorials and forums before attempting a flight. “Then consider going out and buying one of the cheapest and simplest ones you can,” says Highton. “Take it to a safe place that’s not around other people or animals, where you’re not likely to damage property and you’re not near an airport.”</p>
<p>The UAV itself and the initial investment of training time aren’t the only startup costs to consider, either. A camera that is lightweight enough to mount on a drone, a gimbal and a wireless viewfinder system are on the list of other necessities. Once commercial use becomes legal, there will likely be training and certification costs, as well as a need to purchase insurance covering the equipment and any damage or injury it might cause. Repair and replacement costs are another factor, and while UAV prices can be expected to drop quickly as the technology advances, early adopters will pay a premium. </p>
<p>Still, getting a bird’s-eye view is a tantalizing prospect for photographers who want to stay ahead of the curve and be ready to meet the market demand when regulations are put in place in the U.S. And once you’ve got the equipment and training, you can take a page from Wilson’s book and let your imagination fly free. On the gear list for his next creative project: a barrel of wine, a chainsaw, and a UAV.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[While working on a story about coral reefs several years ago, underwater photographer David Doubilet was trying to figure out a way to trigger cameras mounted on a retired military ship as it was scuttled to create an artificial reef off Key West, Florida. He planned to mount cameras on the deck to capture still images and time-lapse video as the ship sank, but for safety reasons, he had to trigger he cameras from a distance.
<p>“You cannot—cannot—use a radio trigger,” he explains, because it could prematurely detonate the explosives being used to sink the ship.</p>
<p>He took the problem to <em><a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/">National Geographic’s</a></em> photographic engineering department, which for decades has helped photographers figure out how to make technically difficult images from land, sea and air, of subjects that are often too dangerous, elusive, or physically challenging to approach.</p>
<p>“Kenji and Dave put their heads together”—that’s Kenji Yamaguchi and David Mathews, who now comprise the entire engineering department staff—“and they said, ‘What about a toilet bowl float?’ So they attached a coil of wires with a toilet bowl float draped over the side of the ship, and as it begins to sink, the float pops up and turns the camera on.”</p>
<p>It was an ingenious work-around, elegant in its simplicity, and typical of the department’s creative problem-solving skills. Never mind that Doubilet unwittingly mounted one camera near one of the explosive charges, which blew the toilet float into the sky. It worked anyway. Doubilet recovered the cameras (which were protected by Nexus underwater housings) and <em>NatGeo’s </em>online audience was able to see the ship sink from an on-deck vantage point.</p>
<p>“What happens on the back of a cocktail napkin eventually becomes a published reality, and that journey is extraordinary,” Doubilet says. He adds, “It’s not enough to go someplace with camera and make images, you have to stretch your imagination” beyond what seems technically possible. They call the department of photo engineering.</p>
<p>“The ethos of the magazine is getting pictures of stuff that nobody has seen before,” says long-time contributor <a href="http://www.georgesteinmetz.com/">George Steinmetz</a>. “These guys [in photo engineering] are the unsung heroes of the Geographic.”</p>
<p>The department, which is under the direction of deputy photo editor <a href="http://kengeiger.com/Index/Entry.html">Ken Geiger</a>, once employed ten or more engineers and technicians. It is now down to just two: Mathews, who was trained as an electronics specialist in the Navy before joining <em>National Geographic </em>nearly 20 years ago; and Yamaguchi, who joined nearly 32 years ago as a Nikon camera repairman. His skills as a technical problem solver are the result of accumulated experience under many of the department’s now-retired staff, he says. </p>
<p>“My philosophy is, I’m always looking for the simple solution,” says Yamaguchi. “I don’t want to go through a whole bunch of trouble. If you make something [complicated], if anything goes wrong out in the field, what would you do?” </p>
<p>Long-time <em>NatGeo</em> contributor <a href="http://www.michaelnicknichols.com/">Michael (Nick) Nichols</a> has depended on Yamaguchi and Mathews for his recent projects, notably his work on the lions of the Serengeti and on Yellowstone National Park, the story he’s currently working on. “He’s one of our big customers,” Mathews says. Nichols says “every cool picture” in the Serengeti project has Yamaguchi’s and Mathews’ fingerprints on it. “You wouldn’t know my name if I hadn’t been able to dream about these big pictures that require resources, and they get no credit at all. It’s not me. It’s a team,” Nichols says. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.paulnicklen.com/#bio">Paul Nicklen</a>, who is best known for his close-up images of cold-climate wildlife, including polar bears, grizzly bears and seals, says photographers typically limit themselves to what’s possible to shoot with the gear they have. But with his access to <em>NatGeo’s</em> photo engineering department, “You ask yourself, ‘What pictures do I want to make?’ and then work backwards. You can dream up any shot you want, and as long as you give them enough warning,” they’ll help figure out how to shoot it.</p>
<p>One of his most iconic images shows a polar bear swimming under an ice floe. The water was too cold for diving, not to mention the danger of swimming with polar bears. So photo engineering set Nicklen up with a camera in an underwater housing, mounted on a pole, with a video feed to a computer that Nicklen used to control his camera from the surface. “They gave me a virtual reality setup that nobody else was making at the time,” he says.</p>
<p>Nicklen, who won the London Natural History Museum’s (NHM) Wildlife Photographer of the Year Award in 2012 for <a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/news/2012/october/winning-wildlife-photos-2012-revealed115326.html">an underwater shot of emperor penguins</a>, says the pole camera’s computer controls and video feed allow him to control aperture and shutter speed, frame shots and trigger the camera from a laptop at a distance of “10 to 500 feet.” (The department has been perfecting pole cameras since Doubilet got the department to rig one for him to shoot inside the mouth of a great white shark more than 30 years ago.)</p>
<p>And then there are the ever-more-sophisticated camera traps, which have enabled Nicklen and other photographers—most notably Nick Nichols and <a href="http://www.stevewinterphoto.com/">Steve Winter</a>—to leave cameras in the wild for days or weeks on end so they can capture images of lions and tigers and bears as they walk by.</p>
<p>Winter, for instance, shot a story about snow leopards in northern India in 2008. The conditions were nearly impossible because of the rough, steep terrain, the altitude (up to 18,000 feet), the temperatures (as low as -40 degrees Fahrenheit at night) and the notorious elusiveness of the cats. He spent 13 months on the story, shooting exclusively with 14 camera traps customized by the photo engineering department. He got just eight pictures, but one of those images won him the NHM Wildlife Photographer of the Year honors in 2008.</p>
<p>“I could not do what I do without their help,” Winter says of the photo engineering department. He has shot other stories about big cats and megafauna all over the world using camera traps (he’s currently working on a story about leopards from Siberia to South Africa).  </p>
<p>He marvels at his success rate with gear modified by the engineering department. “I have to have camera traps that work in heat, cold, and rain,” he says, adding, “99 percent of the time, everything works.” </p>
<p>The improvements have been incremental. When he first started, he says, “We used to put flashes [for the camera traps] in plastic bags, until Kenji said, ‘This will fit in a PVC pipe.’” The engineering department promptly machined parts and made connectors, and suddenly it was possible to shoot with the traps in Asia during monsoon season.</p>
<p>In the past year or so, Yamaguchi and Mathews finally came across a reliable and affordable transmitter for firing camera trap strobes wirelessly. “I knew they wanted wireless strobes, but it was too much money,” Yamaguchi says. Nichols points out that it’s not a matter of just buying off-the-shelf tools, such as Pocket Wizards and Trailmaster remote camera triggers, and expecting them to work. “A lot of this stuff is not built for what we put it through,” Nichols says.</p>
<p>The photo engineering department hacks those tools to make them more dependable, and in the case of batteries, longer-lasting. Those improvements have enabled photographers to leave camera traps unattended for weeks, eliminated their frustrations over animals chewing though strobe wires, and given them the ability to use numerous wireless strobes with each camera trap. Rather than a maximum of three hard-wired strobes, they can light entire environments.</p>
<p>Nichols, who is now at work on what he says will be his last story for <em>National Geographic</em>—about the ecosystem of Yellowstone National Park—says photo engineering’s improvements to camera traps now enable photographers to compose and light images of animals in their natural habitats that look like museum dioramas. Nichols has been taking it a step further, combining remote cameras with infrared lights, as well as using spy cameras without visible light, to avoid any disturbance to the animals. “With some creatures you just cannot use light,” he says. “So the whole concept has to become about nothing being there.” </p>
<p>A particular challenge for the Yellowstone project is photographing wolves, which are notoriously elusive. Nichols used robot cameras and drones to great advantage on his last project about the lions of the Serengeti. But drones are illegal in U.S. national parks, and while the National Park Service chose to allow Nichols access because his photography supports research being conducted by biologists, out of concern for the wolves, the Park Service imposed strict conditions on how he uses remote cameras to monitor wolf dens: the cameras have to be out of reach of the wolves, they can produce no sound or light, they must have no external cables, and Nichols must leave them in place without checking them for at least three months.</p>
<p>To heed their restrictions, Nichols called Yamaguchi, who told him <em>National Geographic’s </em>research division—which has its own engineering department—had already built remote cameras to those specifications for an earlier (but fruitless) effort to photograph ivory-billed woodpeckers in Arkansas. (Whether the birds are extinct—or if a few continue to survive—is subject to debate.) </p>
<p>Nichols plans to deploy the remote cameras this spring and recover them in early summer. He’s hoping to capture intimate, emotional images of wolves and their pups as a contribution to the ongoing debate about the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone. If the remote cameras are successful, “The images will provide an important view to the researchers as well as media,” he says. His story about Yellowstone is currently scheduled for publication in the May 2016 issue of <em>National Geographic</em>.</p>
<p>The photo engineering department was also behind Nichols on his last high-profile project, <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/08/serengeti-lions/quammen-text">about lions of the Serengeti</a>, published in August 2013. “The stuff I could shoot by holding the camera, with a long lens, the world has seen a million times,” he says. He wanted to document a single pride of lions at close range, which required a heavily modified Land Rover, remote-controlled camera cars and camera drones.</p>
<p>Though an Africa-based Land Rover specialist made structural modifications to the Land Rover, the rest was all the photo engineering department. About the process of figuring out solutions, Mathews says, “Some of it is trial-and-error, some of it is mechanical design.” But the basic questions are usually these: What’s an appropriate camera platform? And how do we trigger the cameras remotely? We have to think about how to take an image from the camera and transmit it back to the photographer so that he can compose the photo and fire the camera.”</p>
<p>“We employ different techniques to get that done,” depending upon the environment and conditions, Mathews continues. Although the engineering department has a machine shop for fabricating just about anything from scratch, most solutions start with off-the-shelf gear they purchase, then improve and continually modify.</p>
<p>Mathews says the department takes new technology—often consumer-grade tools, such as drones, when they were first available at an affordable price—and combines it with professional camera gear.</p>
<p>To photograph lions from their perspective, photo engineering purchased two off-the-shelf remote-controlled cars for about $600 each. Walter Boggs—an engineering department employee who has since retired—spent nearly a year modifying them with video and still cameras and infrared lights so Nichols could photograph the lions on the dark, moonless nights when they were most active, and a Wi-Fi-enabled video monitor so he could control the cameras via computer from the safety of the Land Rover.</p>
<p>“We made one of the signature pictures [of the story] on the third day” using a camera car, Nichols says. But ultimately it lacked the power and ground clearance he needed. So he talked <em>National Geographic</em> into buying and modifying a 40-pound robotic vehicle that ran on tank treads.</p>
<p>The camera drone was also a challenge. Although camera drones are now widely available, off-the-shelf drones capable of carrying heavy professional cameras were unavailable in 2011, when Nichols started the project. “There was a popular camera copter that came as a kit,” Mathews says. But it vibrated too much, and was capable of carrying nothing heavier than a point-and-shoot camera. “The quality of imagery wasn’t there.”</p>
<p>The photo engineering department tried all kinds of modifications, including varying the size and orientation of the propellers, adding motors, lengthening the craft to stabilize it, and modifying the shock absorbers to insulate the camera from vibration. Eventually, they were able to get it to fly with a Canon EOS 5D, and Nichols used it to shoot some landscapes. The effort was an example of how photo engineering takes emerging technology and pushes the limits on behalf of photographers.</p>
<p>Between the big projects, Mathews and Yamaguchi research new technology that might improve the pole cameras, camera traps, drones and other gear they’ve already modified. Mathews says he’s always on the lookout for new micro controllers (computer chips) that give photographers better control over remote cameras and other gear. “Sometimes we have to do something as quickly as possible, then it comes back in the door, and we have time to ask: How can we do this better?” </p>
<p>Yamaguchi and Mathews are also working constantly on making power supplies for cameras, strobes, and other gear more dependable and longer-lasting. They have mastered sleep-mode hacks to all sorts of gear, to preserve battery power in the bush. And when we spoke with Yamaguchi in October, he was busy wiring lithium ion battery packs for a popular brand of strobes that were lighter than the OEM battery packs, and one-quarter the cost. </p>
<p>But to the dismay of long-time <em>NatGeo</em> contributors, many of whom attribute the magazine’s success in no small part to the photo engineering department, the department’s future is unclear. Staff has been cut by attrition. The department’s budget is shrinking, and may be cut even more in the coming year, as <em>National Geographic</em> grapples with declining print revenues.</p>
<p>“These guys have made it where I can do this stuff, and I love ’em to death. This can’t go away. You can’t be <em>National Geographic </em>without this,” Nichols asserts. “If someone discovers the last ivory-billed woodpecker, you better figure out a way to photograph it.”</p>
<p>Doubilet says, “Regardless of wonderful or amazing [gear] you can buy on the Internet, photographers will always dream of taking it one step farther, which means that photo engineering need never go out of business.” </p>
<p>But it will be administrators, not photographers, who determine the department’s future. Asked what he thinks of the department’s prospects, Yamaguchi says, “If you find out, let me know.”</p>]]></article_text>

    <article_text><![CDATA[Now that the dust has settled after Photokina and PhotoPlus Expo, photographers have a towering pile of new and soon-to-be released products to consider. While the Consumer Electronics Show looms large and there are bound to be last-minute surprises, we thought we’d highlight some of the gear we’re excited about at the dawn of 2015. 
<p><strong><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/PanasonicLUMIX_1_Gear.jpg" style="float: left;" />Panasonic Lumix LX100</strong></p>
<p>The Lumix LX100 is the first point-and-shoot with a 12.8-megapixel, 1.33-inch Micro Four Thirds-sized image sensor. Using the larger sensor, Panasonic was able to implement its Multi Aspect Ratio technology, which lets you use various crops of the sensor as you adjust aspect ratio while preserving overall resolution. So while the LX100’s sensor is larger than the 1-inch sensors found on other advanced compact cameras, the effective area used in a given photo depends on the aspect ratio you choose and is, at its largest, only about 1.5X larger than a 1-inch sensor. Not that we’re complaining. Considering how compact the LX100 is, its sensor is relatively huge. </p>
<p>Beyond sensor size, the LX100 borrows many features—including 4K video capture—from Panasonic’s high-end head-turner, the GH4. With the LX100, Panasonic is introducing a new 4K Photo Mode that lets you isolate an 8-megapixel still image during 4K recording. The camera sets picture quality and brightness settings optimized for still images, and you choose the aspect ratio you want to record in (4:3, 3:2, 16:9 or 1:1). The images are saved as JPEGs, with complete EXIF data for each file. The new mode can be used in conjunction with a 4K loop record function that saves your last five 2-minute video clips, so you can let the camera roll as you wait for the perfect photo op without devouring all of your memory card space. </p>
<p>Beyond video, the LX100 clocks in at 11 fps in continuous shooting mode with the ability to lock AF in 0.14 seconds and track AF during 5-fps burst shooting. You’ll find a bright variable aperture f/1.7–2.8 lens with an equivalent focal range of 24–75mm. There’s a 3-inch tilting LCD and a 2,764K-dot electronic viewfinder, plus Wi-Fi and NFC for wirelessly pairing with mobile devices.</p>

<p><strong><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/NIKON_D750_1_Gear.jpg" style="float: left;" />Nikon D750</strong></p>
<p>Nikon capped an already busy 2014 by adding yet another full-frame DSLR to its portfolio: the D750. This new camera staked out its own series of “firsts” for Nikon’s full-frame lineup. To wit, the D750 is the first to incorporate a new 24.3-megapixel CMOS sensor. It also has built-in Wi-Fi, a vari-angle LCD and a new build that makes it the thinnest DSLR Nikon makes. Situated between the D610 and D810, the D750 borrows heavily from the latter, especially in the video department. It’s fast, too. The camera’s Advanced Multi-Cam 3500-FX II AF system can track objects in continuous shooting mode at the camera’s maximum burst speed of 6.5 fps. A first for any Nikon DSLR, the D750 can lock focus on subjects in as little as -3 EV illumination. </p>

<p><strong>Samsung NX1<img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/Samsung_NX1_2_Gear.jpg" style="float: right;" /></strong></p>
<p>While some big-name camera makers keep 4K video at arms-length from their DLSRs, Samsung is making a concerted push to court hybrid still and video shooters with the NX 1, its newest mirrorless flagship. It’s one of the first cameras capable of recording in 4K using the new HEVC codec, which offers more efficient compression than its H.264 predecessor. The NX1 will record compressed 4K (4096x2160 pixels) video direct to an SD card at 24 fps and compressed UltraHD (3840x2160) footage at 24- or 30 fps. You can also record uncompressed footage to an external recorder via the NX1’s HDMI 1.4 output. </p>
<p>The NX1 is built around a 28-megapixel, APS-C-sized (23.5x15.7mm) CMOS image sensor of Samsung’s own design, and it is the first sensor of its size to feature backside illumination. While it offers roughly eight million more pixels than Samsung’s NX30, the photo diodes are the same size—a space-saving consequence of the BSI sensor. This endows the NX1 with better low-light performance, up to ISO 51,200. </p>
<p>Another highlight is the new autofocus system that employs 205 phase-detection AF points—of which 153 are cross-type sensors—for 90-percent frame coverage. This phase-detection system combines with 209 contrast-detection AF sensors to enable the NX1 to track focus on moving objects even while bursting at the NX1’s extremely rapid 15 fps. The phase detection AF will aid videographers too, since the NX1 will be able to lock focus faster and more smoothly than a purely contrast-based AF system could.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $1,499 (body); $2,799 (16–50mm f/2–2.8 S lens, grip, battery and charger)</p>

<p><strong>Leica M-P (Typ 240)<img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/Leica-M_3_Gear.jpg" style="float: right;" /></strong></p>
<p>Leica delighted rangefinder aficionados with the introduction of the digital M in 2012 and is out to top it with the new M-P (Typ 240). Like the M, the M-P features a 24-megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor but with an expanded buffer of 2GB for continuous shooting at 3 fps up to 24 full-resolution frames. The 0.68X optical viewfinder offers split and superimposed manual focusing with a new frame selection lever that projects six different focal lengths into the viewfinder. The M-P features a native sensitivity range of ISO 200–6400, with the option to decrease to ISO 100 when shooting under brighter conditions. The camera supports 1920x1080p video recording at 24- and 25 fps. Leica claims its 3-inch sapphire glass LCD display is “almost unbreakable.” Designed to be discreet, Leica swapped out their iconic red dot logo in favor a small “Leica” engraving to denote the brand. </p>

<p>The latest addition to Olympus’ line of high-end Pro lenses will come as a relief to the shoulders of nature photographers everywhere. Despite its focal length, the new 40–150mm f/2.8 Pro weighs a little more than two pounds and measures in at just over 6 inches long—and stays that way, since the zoom action is entirely internal. It maintains a constant f/2.8 aperture and uses dual linear voice coil motors to keep focusing fast and quiet. This 80–300mm full-frame equivalent lens is capable of focusing on objects from as close as 20 inches and offers a dedicated function button, manual-focus clutch and a built-in sliding protective lens hood that can support the full weight of the lens, should you turn it upside down. It’s the first Olympus Pro lens to feature Super EDA glass to reduce optical aberrations. And those nature photographers should appreciate the solid build: It’s dust-, splash- and freezeproof, with 11 separate seals to keep Mother Nature at bay. </p>

<p><strong>Canon EOS 7D Mark II<img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/Canon_7D_2_Gear.jpg" style="float: right;" /></strong></p>
<p>Canon faithful waited a long time for a refresh of the EOS 7D. It finally arrived in November, towing many firsts for the EOS line in its wake. For instance, the EOS 7D Mark II is the first EOS DSLR to run dual DIGIC 6 processors, a one-two computational punch that powers a 10-fps burst mode. Canon bumped up the buffer to accommodate up to 31 RAW images or 1,900 JPEGs, vastly surpassing the original 7D’s 130-JPEG buffer. The 7D Mark II also employs a new AF system with 65 cross-type AF points for better low-light focusing. An improved version of Canon’s Dual Pixel CMOS AF uses dedicated pixels on the CMOS image sensor for phase detection autofocus to deliver “camcorder-like” focusing during video recording. The tech has been upgraded to offer adjustable movie servo AF speeds in five-stop adjustments as well as the ability to adjust AF tracking sensitivity on a sliding scale. </p>
<p>The 20-megapixel 7D Mark II uses a newly developed APS-C-sized sensor with a native sensitivity range of ISO 100–16,000 for stills and video. Speaking of video, you’ll be able to record at a maximum of 1920x1080p at 60 fps. You’ll frame your compositions through a 3-inch display or a viewfinder with a 100-percent field of view that can overlay data such as an electronic level display or a grid. Built-in GPS is also on hand for geo-tagging images. Canon claims the 7D Mark II’s magnesium-alloy body is sealed with four times the moisture and dust resistance of the original 7D, so inclement weather shouldn’t be an obstacle to your shoot. </p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $1,799 (body); $2,149 (with EF-S 18–135mm f/3.5–5.6 IS STM lens)</p>

<p><strong><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/GoPro4_2_Gear.jpg" style="float: left;" />GoPro Hero4</strong></p>
<p>Everyone’s favorite action camera got a major refresh in the fall of 2014. The flagship Hero4 Black enjoys faster frame rates across the board, recording 4K video at 30 fps, 2.7K footage at 50 fps and 1920x1080p at up to 120 fps. The 12-megapixel Hero4 Black also features full-resolution still photo bursts at 30 fps with faster Wi-Fi and improved audio processing that GoPro claims offers double the dynamic range of its Hero3 predecessor. Alongside faster frame rates is a new HiLight Tag feature which lets you earmark key moments in your video while you’re recording, either through the GoPro app or a dedicated button on the camera. These highlights can then be quickly located in GoPro’s Studio software for sharing on social media or using in your highlight reel.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the need for all that speed, the new Silver edition Hero4 records 4K as well, but at a slower 15- or 12.5 fps. It has slower HD frame rates as well, topping out at 60 fps. That’s not to say the Silver Hero is bereft of any new goodies: It’s the first GoPro to sport a new touchscreen display and will also include the HiLight Tag functionality. Like the Black edition, the Silver Hero4 is capable of 30-fps still photo bursts at 12-megapixel resolution. As far as durability is concerned, GoPro will continue to offer an accessory housing that will enable you to submerge your Hero4 in up to 131 feet of water.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $500 (Black edition); $400 (Silver edition)</p>

<p><strong>Tamron SP 15–30mm f/2.8 Di VC USB<img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/Tamron_SP1530F28Di_Gear.jpg" style="float: right;" /></strong></p>
<p>At Photokina, Tamron told the world it was hard at work developing a new wide-angle lens that it claims will be the first in its class to offer vibration compensation. The full-frame SP 15–30mm f/2.8 Di VC USB will feature Tamron’s three-coil anti-shake technology, which moves the lens via three ceramic ball bearings to compensate for movement. The Sony variant of this lens won’t contain vibration compensation, as Sony already provides it in their camera bodies. There’s also an ultrasonic silent motor on hand for quiet focusing, and you can fine-tune focus manually while still in AF mode. The new lens will feature 18 elements with an Expanded Glass Molded Apsherical element plus several LD elements for tackling distortion throughout the zoom range. Ghosting and flaring are kept at bay with Tamron’s Broad-Band Anti-Reflection coating and, for the first time, Tamron will apply a fluorine coating to the front lens element to repel water and dirt. We’ll likely see this lens in 2015.</p>

<p><strong><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/Fujix100t_Gear.jpg" style="float: left;" />Fujifilm X100T</strong></p>
<p>The X100T marks the debut of a new “hybrid” viewfinder with an electronic rangefinder mode that Fuji says mimics the functions of a mechanical rangefinder for focusing through the electronic viewfinder. The frame coverage of the EVF has been bumped up from the 90 percent found in the X100S to 92 percent, giving you a bit more accuracy when composing through the EVF. Image effects such as film simulations can now be previewed in real time in the viewfinder as well. The X100T uses a 16.3-megapixel, APS-C-sized X-Trans II CMOS sensor and Fuji’s EXR Processor II technology. It offers a 23mm f/2 lens (35mm full-frame equivalent) capable of focusing on subjects as close as 10cm. Fuji has also tweaked the body design, adding more controls over aperture in the aperture ring (now adjustable in 1/3 steps) as well as extending the exposure compensation dial by +/- 3 stops. Among the camera’s other highlights include 1920x1080p video recording at 60 fps and a maximum bit rate of 36Mbps with manual focusing during video recording; high-speed shooting at 6 fps to 25 full resolution JPEGs and a 3-inch, 1.04-million-dot LCD display.</p>

<p><strong>Phottix Indra500<img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/Phottix-Indra_Gear(1).jpg" style="float: right;" /></strong></p>
<p>Another light that caught our eye was Phottix’s new Indra500, a 500-Watt light capable of TTL metering for Canon and Nikon cameras thanks to its internal Odin TTL flash trigger. You’ll have the option of three firing modes—manual, TTL and stroboscopic—as well as a high-speed sync mode with shutter speeds up to 1/8000 sec. In strobe mode, the flash can be set to a frequency between 1–100Hz for a total of up to 100 flashes. There’s also a second curtain sync for achieving a streaking light effect, and you can adjust power output from 1/128 power to full power in 1/3 stop increments. Thanks to its built-in Odin wireless controller, you can shoot in manual or TTL mode, adjust flash exposure and use high speed or second curtain sync from the Phottix Odin or Mitros+ receivers. The Indra500 will also incorporate the company’s Strato II receiver for wireless triggering in manual mode. Phottix will sell an external battery pack to power the Indra500 for up to 340 full-power shots. The battery pack offers two power ports so it can run a pair of Indra500s as well as a USB port for charging up mobile devices. </p>

<p><strong><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/sigma-dp1-_Gear.jpg" style="float: left;" />Sigma dp1 Quattro</strong></p>
<p>The dp1 Quattro is the second camera in Sigma’s updated dp series to incorporate the 29-megapixel APS-C-sized Foveon X3 Quattro image sensor—the first, ironically, was named the dp2. The Quattro sensor features a proprietary three-layer design meant to replicate how film emulsions capture red, green and blue light. Working in tandem, these three layers create Sigma’s equivalent of a 39-megapixel image, and Sigma’s True III image processor crunches the data to output an image that the company claims delivers truer-to-life colors and more realistic images than competing sensor designs. Beyond the sensor, the dp1 offers a 19mm f/2.8 lens (28mm full-frame equivalent), 14-bit RAW image capture and a sensitivity range of ISO 100–6400. The body design marries a thin, panoramic frame with a prominent grip that extends from the back of the camera, giving the dp1 a particularly distinctive look. This coming year should also see the arrival of the third installment, the dp3. It will be identical to the dp1 and dp2 save for its 50mm, f/2.8 lens.</p>

    <article_text><![CDATA[It had been years since <a href="http://www.mattblack.com/">Matt Black</a> had assisted him in San Francisco, but when <a href="http://edkashi.com/">Ed Kashi</a> came across one of Black’s black-and-white images of the recent drought in California’s Central Valley on <a href="http://instagram.com/mattblack_blackmatt">his Instagram feed</a> last year, he knew what he had to do. Kashi, who had been assigned to cover the drought in the Central Valley for <em><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/">The New Yorker</a></em>, had researched the story, but he also knew that Black had developed deep roots over his years of documenting the valley. 
<p>“I didn’t want him to think I was being an interloper,” Kashi says. There was no way that Kashi could pull off in a week what Black had spent a lifetime capturing. So he called Black. Says Kashi, “I know Matt. He’s a one-of-a-kind kinda guy. He’s dedicated his life to the Central Valley.” </p>
<p>The call to Black quickly led to the idea of collaborating; Kashi would shoot a video, with Black providing the stills shot over the summer, supplemented with images informed by his more than 15 years of living and working in the valley. <em>The New Yorker’s</em> director of photography Whitney Johnson, who had originally commissioned the story to Kashi, was amenable to the collaboration.  </p>
<p>“To her credit, I didn’t even finish the sentence,” Kashi remembers. “I said ‘I was just talking to Matt Black, and I had this idea that we’d collaborate’ and she goes, ‘Yes.’”</p>
<p>Kashi and Black spent a week in June capturing footage for the video, but Black spent the next four months shooting. Droughts are not uncommon in the Central Valley, but this one was particularly rough; wells and lake beds were running dry, reservoirs emptied, and the people who came to work the land stood idle as the wind blew it away.</p>
<p>“Droughts are just a fact of life in the Central Valley. This one is truly something different,” Black says. “It’s a whole other level of extremity, because of the importance of the Central Valley to our food supply in the United States. Half of the nation’s food comes from right here.”</p>
<p>To tell the story of the drought’s effect on the valley, Kashi and Black viewed the problem through the lens of the Basque and Peruvian sheepherders working the land—Black insisted on it. He felt it was important that the stories and characters that had been ignored were given a voice, especially given a platform as influential as <em>The New Yorker</em>. “I don’t think anybody even realizes there are sheepherders in California.” Kashi remarked. </p>
<p>Black turned over a 70-photo edit to Johnson, and Kashi turned over a hard drive of footage to <a href="http://www.skydylanrobbins.com/">Sky Dylan-Robbins</a>, a video producer at <em>The New Yorker</em>. Dylan-Robbins would edit it into a seven-minute video called <em><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/california-paradise-burning">California: Paradise Burning</a></em>, published on <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/">newyorker.com</a> and screened at The Half King in New York City in November. Johnson cut Black’s 70 photos down to four for the print magazine; photo editor Amy Connors worked on <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/29/dry-land">an 11-photo gallery for newyorker.com.</a></p>
<p>“Whitney went in and did this masterful edit,” Black gushes. “The four she chose, and the sequence, was for me, revelatory.”</p>
<p>Esthetically, the video and photos matched the palette of Black’s earlier work in the valley—bleak, monochrome and high-contrast. Black has shot in black-and-white since he worked at a newspaper as a teenager. He’s been shooting in the valley ever since.</p>
<p>“From then until now, it’s just been one long engagement with this place,” Black says. “For that reason alone, I haven’t switched, because I started in black-and-white. It’s all one continuous thing.”</p>
<p>The work is not subtle; Kashi and Black use stark images, frank interviews and chilling field recordings to drive home the valley’s harsh reality. In one powerful shot, Kashi trains his lens on a sickly sheep, resting in the 100-plus-degree heat, its labored breathing the sole audio cue to the setting. With less grass to graze and water in short supply, several sheep were sickly or dying.</p>
<p>Black says he chooses to stay out of California’s water politics, which are notoriously messy, preferring to tell the stories of the little guys, the ones who don’t have the budget for PR consultants. </p>
<p>“It’s big money, it’s big power,” Black explains. “It’s Los Angeles vs. San Francisco, agriculture vs. cities. It gets serious. And frankly, it’s too much for me as an individual to try to wade into that stuff. I want to show what the ground-level impact is on people.”</p>
<p>Black was named a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2003 for an earlier project in the valley, <a href="http://www.mattblack.com/blackokies/01.html">“Black Okies,”</a> and the series he shot on Mexican migrants for the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, “Dust to Dust,” won the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for Domestic Photography in 2007. He still lives in Exeter, California, a small town in the valley. For Black, each of these projects is merely a chapter in a story that he will always be telling.</p>
<p>“It will be a lifelong engagement,” Black says. “It’s not a photo project, it’s a commitment.”</p>]]></article_text>
