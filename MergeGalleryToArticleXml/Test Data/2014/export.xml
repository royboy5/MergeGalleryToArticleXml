            <article_text><![CDATA[Clients hire commercial photographer <a href="http://www.kevinarnoldphoto.com/">Kevin Arnold</a> to shoot image libraries because of his experience telling stories through his photos. He credits renowned photojournalist <a href="http://www.ronhaviv.com/">Ron Haviv</a> with helping him think differently about how to create unexpected images while shooting assignments.
<p>Arnold signed up for a master class Haviv taught in 2012 at the <a href="http://2015.palmspringsphotofestival.com/">Palm Springs Photo Festival</a>. At the time, Arnold had already shot libraries for clients like Canada Tourism and Sperry Topsider, and with the help of consultant Allegra Wilde, had remade his portfolio of outdoor adventure imagery to emphasize his storytelling ability. In the workshop, Arnold and his classmates were given the chance to shoot for two days on a Marine base near Palm Springs and get critiques from Haviv. Arnold saw it “as an opportunity to learn from someone whose work I’d admired.” While most of the photographers enrolled in the class were “budding photojournalists,” he says, he looked forward to getting “an outsider perspective” on his work.</p>
<p>When Haviv looked at Arnold’s images, “He pushed me to frame things in a different way,” the commercial photographer recalls. “He would push me by saying, ‘Can you do that in a more unusual way?’ It opened up my eyes to more ideas about framing.”</p>
<p>Haviv earned his reputation covering the Balkan conflicts, and has since covered conflicts in Darfur, Afghanistan and Cairo’s Tahrir Square. Although he typically covers stories over long periods of time, he is often called upon by news magazine and NGO clients—as well as collectors of his prints—to deliver a single frame that summarizes a story. Arnold says Haviv encouraged him to think about how to capture and convey information less literally, “and leave something for the viewer.” After the workshop, Arnold tried to apply what he had learned while shooting image library assignments. “It’s always something in the back of my mind: How can we show something unusual?” The images he has made when he has worked to capture something less predictable are often “the standout shots” that his clients like.</p>
<p>“When you’re moving quickly and trying to tick a lot of boxes for the client, it’s easy to default to framing or lighting an image the way you know it will work from previous experience,” Arnold says. Haviv’s advice, he says, “gave me the confidence to push beyond that.”</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<em><a href="http://www.sunset.com/">Sunset</a></em> <a href="http://www.sunset.com/">Magazine</a> is a lifestyle magazine for the Western states, covering food, travel and home. Founded in 1898, now owned by Time Inc. and based in Menlo Park, California, the magazine has won acclaim for its attention to environmental concerns. Once thought of as a magazine for retirees, in the past decade it has successfully increased its readership among people in their 20s, 30s and 40s. Yvonne Stender, the photography director, joined the magazine 11 years ago. Born in San Francisco, Stender lived in New York City for 20 years before returning to California. She graduated from the School of Visual Arts in New York City. She talks to <em>PDN</em> about <em>Sunset</em>, the guides and books it publishes, the many ways she finds photographers whose work fits the <em>Sunset </em>mission, and why photo editing isn’t what it used to be.
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What’s the mission of <em>Sunset</em>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yvonne Stender:</strong> It’s your guide to living in the West. Our tagline used to be, “It’s different out here.” And I have to say, it really is. Now the tagline is, “Your guide to living in the West.”</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Is there a <em>Sunset</em> style?</strong></p>
<p><strong>YS:</strong> It’s natural. It’s not oversaturated. It’s not too wide angle. It’s real. It’s not overly manipulated. It’s [showing] real people in our desired demographic, 35 to 50, and multiethnic.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How is the West different, and how do the sections of the magazine you’re assigning photography for reflect that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>YS: </strong>It’s not as steeped in tradition. It’s a place a lot of people come to in order to start over. You have access to so many different terrains here, you get spoiled. So we tell readers where to go, what to eat, where to hike. In the garden section, we’re very focused on the drought; we tell you how to rip up your lawn. We’ve been focused on xeriscaping for a long time. We touch on tech very little, but when we do it’s when it touches on the lifestyle. Food, garden, home, travel: That’s our focus.</p>
<p>We also do our Insider Guides. These are more urban-focused, and tend to go to a smaller subscriber base and have a smaller newsstand presence. When I assign photographers to shoot for the guides, I tend to hire newcomers.</p>
<p>For example I recently worked with <a href="http://kimberlygenevieve.com/">Kimberly Genevieve</a> [a Los Angeles editorial and lifestyle photographer]. I got some pickup from a store that she had shot for, and I thought, “This is nice work.” The store didn’t have the rights to her images so I had to contact her, and she said, “You know, I’d really like to shoot for you.” After looking at her website, I assigned her the next time we had a guide.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Where else do you look for photographers?</strong></p>
<p><strong>YS:</strong> Instagram. Referrals from photographers and other magazines. In Los Angeles, they have the <a href="http://monthofphotography.com/home.php">Month of Photography</a>. I seem to be on their mailing list and a lot of the galleries seem to show emerging photographers. Even if I can’t go, I’ll save their list. I look at <a href="http://www.featureshoot.com/">Feature Shoot</a>, <a href="https://www.nowness.com/">Nowness</a> and other photo blogs. I’ll also pay attention to their Instagram feeds. Feature Shoot and <a href="http://collectdotgive.org/">collect.give</a> [the fine art photography site that donates money from print sales to worthy charities] have Instagram takeovers. I also use traditional means like <a href="http://www.wonderfulmachine.com/photographers/any/Austin%2C+Texas/mi/30.336748/-97.648482/1/">Wonderful Machine</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What’s the appeal of Instagram?</strong></p>
<p><strong>YS:</strong> Its immediacy. If I’m standing in line for something and I’m bored, I’ll start looking at photos. I’ll do a screen grab of something I like, to note the location or if I see a funny comment on the photo itself that let’s me know it must be from a photographer.</p>
<p>I’ve told photographers: Putting your location on your Instagram feed is key.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you not want photographers to contact you? </strong></p>
<p><strong>YS:</strong> I hate the phone. I like a creative mailer with your place of residence on there. It can be a link to your blog: Just let me know where I’ll find the work you think is most relevant to us.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: You recently reviewed portfolios at the Telluride Photo Festival. Why do you do portfolio reviews like this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>YS:</strong> I had never been before, and when they asked me to participate, I thought, why not? The <a href="http://www.telluridephotofestival.com/">Telluride Photo Festival</a> is about outdoor and adventure photography. Occasionally we’ll need a surfing image, or a photo of a remote hiking spot.</p>
<p>Portfolio reviews are key for me as much as for photographers. There are people I’ve known about but never met who I get to see, and I get to see their whole body of work.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.justinbailie.com/">Justin Bailie</a>, for example. We worked with him when he was Sacramento- and Tahoe-based and did adventure photography. When he moved up to the Oregon coast I thought: good new resource there. He grew up in the restaurant industry and he loves to cook and forage, and I’d seen his Instagram feeds on food. I assigned him to shoot some restaurants for some books we’re doing, and he did a lot of extra stuff for us that was beautiful. When I saw him previously, I saw he had also done work for the <em>Edible </em>magazines. Now I know he’s not just an outdoors photographer, he can do interiors and food.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: To get photos for the books <em>Sunset </em>publishes, are you asking for additional rights on the images you’ve assigned for the magazine?</strong></p>
<p><strong>YS: </strong>The book division is separate, and it’s out of Birmingham, Alabama. If we want to re-use an image that appeared in a book, we’ll pay [an additional] space rate. It hasn’t become this big synergistic thing yet, so for the photographer, it works out great. We don’t ask photographers for their firstborn. Not yet.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What do photographers need to do to win your trust that they can complete an assignment, or get repeat assignments from you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>YS:</strong> I look at what they’ve done before, how well they’ve told a story, who they’ve shot for before, how consistent their look is, how well they’ve edited their website. When I’ve met with them when they’ve come through town, I can tell they’re not too introverted. They are representing the magazine.</p>
<p>I can tell more by how buttoned-up they are in their presentation when meeting with them. I’ve had people show up for a meeting with no notepad or without their iPad and say, “Just look at my website.” I don’t need you to sit with me to go through your website. I’ve had people come in and it’s clear that their rep told them to take the meeting with <em>Sunset</em>, but they don’t know that much about the magazine.</p>
<p>Don’t be flaky about your business, basically. It helps if photographers get their paperwork done, get their billing done on time, reference the shoot properly, and put their address on their invoices. It’s funny how often that comes up. I appreciate when photographers do research on their own, before a shoot: Problem solving.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What do you think has changed the most in the 20 years you’ve been a photo editor?</strong></p>
<p><strong>YS:</strong> I feel more thinly spread than ever before. I think email has sped that up significantly, and the fact that we’re doing more on so many platforms. I just don’t have the time to browse people’s websites like I used to have or time to look at a stack of magazines at home. There’s just less time overall to do more work.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What could photographers do to make a photography director’s life easier?</strong></p>
<p><strong>YS:</strong> I’m sure that photographers would like us to be more responsive, but just be patient. It’s fine to send a gentle reminder: “I’d love to meet with you when your schedule allows.” I know it’s hard for them to imagine when they’re not busy that we can be so busy we cannot answer emails. But I just went out of the office for 15 minutes to check on our camping gear [for an upcoming shoot] and when I came back there were 30 new emails and I have to decide which to save and which to delete.</p>]]></article_text>

            <article_text><![CDATA[It wouldn’t be an article about black-and-white photography tools without the obligatory reference to the master of the genre, Ansel Adams, so here goes: “You don’t take a photograph: You make it.” While the process of taking monochrome images may have changed from Adams’s day, modern technology still leaves plenty of latitude for creativity and craftsmanship when it comes to making monochrome images.
<p><strong><em>Software</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>onOne Perfect B&amp;W<img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/soft_ONONE_GEAR.jpg" style="float: right;" /></strong></p>
<p>A part of onOne’s recently updated Perfect Photo Suite 9, Perfect B&amp;W has gotten several noteworthy upgrades. Among them is the ability to print images directly from Perfect B&amp;W and Smart Photo, which lets you re-edit images with all your previous settings preserved. All your custom tweaks can be saved as a preset, and you can share your custom presets with other Perfect B&amp;W users. Monochrome makers will appreciate the updated automatic tone algorithm that can quickly add brightness and clarity to images. There’s also a new noise-reduction tool that can smooth out an entire image or be targeted at trouble spots in the shadows or highlights. Beyond the retooled black-and-white capabilities, Perfect Photo Suite has had a soup-to-nuts upgrade with a new Browse module that delivers 30-percent faster RAW previews and preset load times, plus new organizational tools to help you manage your sprawling image library. The Premium Edition of Perfect Photo Suite 9 can be used as a standalone app, or as a plug-in for Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, Photoshop (CC and CS6) and Apple Aperture 3. A basic edition drops support for plug-ins.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>$149 (Premium); $99 (Basic) </p>

<p><strong><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/soft_MACPHUN_GEAR.jpg" style="float: left;" />Macphun Tonality pro</strong></p>
<p>The newest monochrome software tool on the block, Tonality Pro is also one of the most powerful. This Mac-only software runs standalone or as a plug-in for Photoshop CC and Lightroom, as well as Aperture. It can process 16-bit RAW images and offers eight image layers to work with. There are over 150 presets to choose from, including a generous catalogue of film emulations, and each preset can be further adjusted using the software’s extensive editing sliders. You can make edits to the presets and save your tweaks as a custom preset, or save your own custom-built presets from scratch. You can further adjust your digital images with the software’s library of 24 textures, which include paper, metal and film variants. Alternatively, you can upload your own custom textures into the program and apply those as well. Tonality Pro brings a number of clever software tricks to bear, such as an Adaptive Exposure tool that lets you adjust the brightness in your image without blowing out the highlights or losing details in the shadows. The software supports stylus editing with variable brush diameters and can add lens blur effects as well. Be sure to check out our review of Tonality Pro in the November issue of PDN and at www.pdnonline.com.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $69</p>

<p><strong>Google Nik Collection Silver Efex Pro 2<img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/soft_GOOGLE_1_GEAR.jpg" style="float: right;" /></strong></p>
<p>Silver Efex Pro 2 contains 38 presets that are broken out into classic-, modern- and vintage- themed libraries. The software’s preset libraries also include space for recently used presets, as well as favorites for easy access. All of Silver Efex’s presets allow for fine-tuning parameters like tone, sensitivity, color filters and more, using the thorough editing toolset. If you’re not satisfied with the canned variety, you can create and save your own personalized presets as well. The software can apply effects globally across an image, or let you dial down using the control points tool to make selective adjustments to portions of the image. If film emulations are your fancy, the program has 18 to choose from, organized by ISO so you’ll have a sense of how grainy you’re about to get before you choose a film. One of the best features of the software is its History Browser, which gives you a visual history of your edits so you can walk back your process to fix mistakes, or simply review just how you created such a fantastic image. Another useful feature of Silver Efex Pro 2 is the ability to pick your editing background from a choice of silver, gray or black to better distinguish your image from the software’s editing window. Since it was absorbed into the Google empire, Nik now packages Silver Efex Pro 2 with its other titles, so you have to spring for the whole suite if you want to flex the Efex.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $149</p>

<p><strong><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/soft_TOTALLY_RAD_4_GEAR.jpg" style="float: left;" />Totally Rad Replichrome I &amp; II</strong></p>
<p>Most black-and-white software developers make a very close study of classic film grains before writing algorithms that will pepper your photo with realistic grain. Totally Rad has gone a step further in its Replichrome I and II by studying how particular films looked when scanned by Fujifilm and Noritsu scanners. The result is the ability to process your images not just by the film type you desire, but by a particular scan type as well. Noritsu “scans” in Replichrome I &amp; II will produce greater saturation and warmer shadows, while the Fujifilm Frontier process will produce darker reds and flatter images. Replichrome I offers four Kodak black-and-white film emulations in addition to a more numerous collection of color films. The second installment, Replichrome II, was launched late summer and delivers 19 new films and 203 unique presets focused on slide films. When you’ve found the film you want, you can choose to under- or overexpose the final image to jack up (or down) grain and color shifts. Both Replichromes are available as plug-ins for Lightroom, Photoshop (CS 6 and CC) and Adobe Camera Raw—but will only work with RAW images files. You can install the software on two computers with a single license.</p>

<p><strong>AlienSkin Exposure 6<img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/soft_ALIEN_2_GEAR.jpg" style="float: right;" /></strong></p>
<p>AlienSkin takes film emulation seriously. Really seriously. For the new Exposure 6, the company shot test films and scoured photographic archives to put discontinued films under the microscope to ensure their digital simulations were as faithful as possible. The object, the company says, is not to apply a film emulation universally and haphazardly, but accurately across the dynamic range of the image. Exposure 6 does far more than render monochrome images—and we covered the ins and outs in Theano Nikitas’ review in the October issue. For our purposes, Alien Skin’s black-and-white chops are impressive. Film stocks include some vintage daguerreotype, wet plate and cyanotype emulations. There are even infrared films like Ilford SFX 200 for that false- color vibe. If you have presets, textures or borders you love, you can sync them across multiple computers so they’re always at hand. Effects can also be applied in batches to speed your workflow. You can use AlienSkin as a standalone program or as a plug- in for Photoshop (CS6 and CC), Lightroom and Aperture 3.</p>

<p><strong><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/soft_TOPAZ_2_GEAR.jpg" style="float: left;" />Topaz Labs B&amp;W Effects</strong></p>
<p>Like the other monochrome software tools mentioned here, Topaz Labs’ B&amp;W Effects draws its emulated film grains from the careful study of scanned film. It boasts one of the more generous libraries of effects, with over 200 of them divided into eight “curated collections.” Ansel Adams fans will appreciate the software’s Zone System view. Using this view, you can break down an image into 11 different zones between pure black and pure white, so you can target edits at specific photo zones while paying homage to the days when doing so was a more painstaking process. You can preview any of the effects before you apply them on a large thumbnail view. Any custom adjustments you make can be saved as a preset for future use. If you want to leave it up to the algorithm, the Quick Tools menu gives you a series of one-click adjustments to stylize images in a snap.</p>

<p><strong><em>Mobile Apps</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Lenka<img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/mobile_LENKA_GEAR.jpg" style="float: right;" /></strong></p>
<p>Not to be confused with the Australian pop singer of the same name, Lenka is actually the brainchild of noted photographer Kevin Abosch. This iOS-only app is not quite overflowing with features, and that’s the point. The simplicity gives you a toolset that lets you get snapping quickly. You can choose between a regular black-and-white filter or a high-contrast one, with effects previewed on your phone’s display in real time. Image aspect ratios can be changed from rectangular to square. Images on your camera roll can be converted to monochrome in Lenka, but the app’s other editing tools consist of just crop and rotate. The app can turn on the flash to use as a continuous light source, but won’t allow flash photography. It also allows for very sensitive touch focusing.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: $2.99</p>

<p><strong>Jixipix Dramatic Black &amp; White</strong></p>
<p>JixiPix Dramatic Black &amp; White is a more extensive editor than Lenka, with tools to spotlight images and sliders to tweak texture, contrast, tone, grain, color and opacity. There are three categories of presets—black-and-white, dramatic black-and-white and infrared—that can be further modified to suit your taste. Feeling lucky? A dedicated randomizer button plucks out a random image effect for you. You can crop photos and share to your camera roll, or out to your social network of choice. Dramatic Black &amp; White is available for both iOS and Android devices.</p>

<p><strong>Red Giant Noir Photo<img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/mobile_RED_GIANT_GEAR.jpg" style="float: right;" /></strong></p>
<p>Red Giant is a purveyor of advanced video graphics software that has dipped its collective toe into the mobile world with Noir Photo. This app not only transforms iPhone images into striking monochromes, but lets you play with lighting in a way that the aforementioned apps don’t. The goal, of course, is to achieve a style evocative of film noir in your iPhone photography. Your lunch has never looked so ominous. The app ditches the customary sliders in favor of buttons Red Giant says were modeled after “analogue spaceship dials.” You can create vignettes by touching and pinching portions of the screen while using dials for contrast, outer exposure and inner exposure, to work in and around the vignette to fine-tune your creation.</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[In her series “Shot at Dawn,” <a href="http://www.chloedewemathews.com/">Chloe Dewe Mathews</a> documents sites in France and Belgium where soldiers from the English, French and Belgian armies were executed for cowardice or desertion during World War I. She photographed the locations during the same seasons and at roughly the same times of day that the executions took place—typically at dawn. “I wanted to echo the environment in which this happened as much as possible,” she says. Commissioned by the <a href="http://www.rsa.ox.ac.uk/">Ruskin School of Art at the University of Oxford</a>, the project will be shown in museums in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Germany, and a book of the work was published this summer in time for the centennial of the start of World War I. While most commemorations of the war focus on battlefield casualties, Mathews’s contemplative, medium-format landscapes and text call attention to what she calls “one of the subplots of the war that’s largely forgotten.”
<p>Paul Bonaventura, a research fellow at the Ruskin School of Art who regularly commissions work by contemporary artists, asked Mathews, a graduate of the school, to produce something for the centenary. While researching possible topics, Mathews met several experts, including Piet Chielens, coordinator of <a href="http://www.inflandersfields.be/en">In Flanders Fields Museum</a> in Ypres, Belgium. Mathews told Chielens that, in her readings, she had been shocked to learn British soldiers had been shot “for losing it mentally in such a traumatic environment,” she says. (All 306 British soldiers shot for cowardice were granted posthumous pardons in 2008.) Chielens, who coauthored a book on the topic, gave Mathews information about executions in Flanders. “In turn, he put me in touch with other historians who had researched the same subject” in other countries, Mathews says. “That’s where it all started.” Once she formulated her project, Bonaventura raised funds for the work from non-profits and government arts funds in Britain and Flanders. After Mathews began shooting, 14-18NOW, the arts organization creating programs around the centennial, joined as a co-commissioner.</p>
<p>Though many of Mathews’ s projects have explored people’s relationship to the land—including a long-term study of communities in the oil-rich region around the Caspian Sea, and a project on China’s Uighurs—she knew it would be difficult to bring history to life through landscapes devoid of people. “I realized it was a challenge I wanted.” She explains, “Sometimes you think differently about your work if you have certain constraints, which can be very useful.” </p>
<p>She talked to several academics and pored over their files. Matching military records, diaries and letters with old aerial photos and Google map searches, she located 23 execution sites, then made six trips through Belgium and France in 2013. “The process was very isolating,” she says. She would typically scout a location in daytime to verify her research. Then she would return before dawn to set up her tripod and Mamiya 7. “It was me by myself, having this strange timetable of going to bed before other people and waking up before other people,” she says, “but that somehow felt appropriate.”</p>
<p>The scouting was unemotional, but as the sun rose, “my mind would start working,” she says. “In the quietude of that time of the morning, things are more raw. I wasn’t thinking [about] what happened there so much until that time of that morning when it became more real,” she says. “It was very melancholy.”</p>
<p>Mathews felt her images should be straightforward. “I don’t want to be preachy about it,” she says, noting that questions surrounding each soldier’s death, and questions of discipline and military justice, make the subject complex. “In the end, it’s about putting something forward for other people to look at and consider.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Mathews thought a repetitive, typological series would discourage reflection. “You see the first three images and you think: Right, I get it.” To combat this, she varied her approach in each location. “I wanted to reflect that visceral feeling, when you stand on some twigs and wet grass in the morning and you’re thinking about that person who did the same,” she says.</p>
<p>In a field in Picardy, she shows a sweeping vista, but in a prison cell in Flanders, she shot a tight close-up of a brick wall. Sometimes, examples were made of deserters, and they were shot in open fields as troops were marched by. “They were very theatrical,” she notes. Other executions were carried out in secluded sites that felt “more intimate,” Mathews says.</p>
<p>Bonaventura suggested bringing a book proposal to <a href="http://www.ivorypress.com/">Ivorypress</a>, the Madrid-based art publisher. Ivorypress’s founder, Elena Ochoa Foster, immediately agreed to publish the work. Mathews wanted a “simple, not fussy” layout that would call attention to the captions, which list the location, the names of the executed, and the times and dates they were executed. The spreads in <em><a href="http://www.ivorypress.com/content/shot-dawn">Shot at Dawn</a></em> reverse the usual order in a photo book: Photos are on the left, text is on the right where the reader’s eye goes first. Says Mathews, “That was a way of rebalancing the usual relationship of text and image.”</p>
<p>Essays by historians Hew Strachan and Helen McCartney provide valuable context about military discipline and battlefield trauma. Mathews hopes that viewers of the book and exhibitions will consider the people who once stood in the landscapes she photographed. She says, “There’s a glaring absence, and it should be glaring,” she says.</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[When <a href="http://www.jansport.com/shop/en/jansport-us">JanSport</a> commissioned some street artists to paint gigantic murals in Brooklyn and San Francisco earlier this year, photographer <a href="http://www.andrewreillyphotography.com/">Andrew Reilly</a> was there documenting the action. During the two-week project, he also chronicled the artists and their friends as they strolled through the cities, ran errands, and checked their phones—often dressed in JanSport gear. 
<p>Reilly, who is based in Carlsbad, California, shot roughly 16,000 images. Twenty percent of them are now being used in various digital and print media targeting young consumers. “We don’t want to find three images and put them everywhere,” says Greg Rowan, creative director of <a href="http://teakdigital.com/">Teak</a>, the San Francisco agency that conceived the street art project and hired Reilly. “We want to tell a story, so when people are exposed to it multiple times, they can see there are different storylines taking place.”</p>
<p>JanSport’s need for multiple images and stories isn’t unique. “Now clients need volumes of images and video that they can cycle in and out, mostly because of social and digital media,” says Susan Cartland, an art production manager at <a href="http://www.mcgarrybowen.com/">mcgarrybowen</a>. Clients are often gathering images first, then deciding where they might be used—in banner ads, in-store displays, native advertising, the company website or social media. That means that rather than carefully crafting single images, photographers are expected to “yield as much as possible from every shoot day,” she says. “We still have plenty of clients who do classic print ads, but as long as digital is a component of any strategy, an asset library is probably going to be a component of what we do for them.”</p>
<p>To find photographers who can handle these assignments, art buyers are looking for specific skills and talents. We asked a few to explain the criteria they use when choosing a photographer to shoot asset libraries.</p>
<p><strong>Creating Visual Narratives</strong></p>
<p>What initially inspired Rowan to hire Reilly for the JanSport library were images in the photographer’s book that showed his ability to shoot narratives. Rowan recalls, for instance, photos of a band Reilly had followed. “They were simple images but they were beautiful and there was a little bit of a story there,” Rowan says. “I could sense the storyline without it being overt.” He adds, “It allowed me to enter the story visually and piece it together in my own imagination, and that was powerful.”</p>
<p>Before shooting on the JanSport mural project began, Rowan, Reilly and Amy Olson, the art director, sat down and planned what they would have people doing each day and where they would go. The goal was for Reilly to capture the subjects in natural-looking scenarios, he says. “So we’d tell them, ‘You’re going to go to Chinatown, we’re going to give you $20 each to do and buy what you want on the street,’ and after Chinatown we’d tell them, ‘You’re going here and here and here.’" Once he had enough images from each location, Reilly recalls, “I tell them, ‘We’re done here, let’s move on.’ So it’s slightly directed, slightly authentic and natural as well.”</p>
<p>Liz Miller Gershfeld, senior art producer at <a href="http://www.energybbdo.com/">Energy BBDO</a>, says that there are many things each advertiser needs the images in a library to communicate. “Interaction with a product or demographic requirements are only a part of the story told,” she says. The images also have to convey action and emotion. Equally vital, she says, is “the need to make a viewer stop and want to spend time with an image, to want to know more of the story, to be relatable.”</p>
<p><strong>The Right Moments, Captured Fast</strong></p>
<p>Library shoots generally require photographers to follow talent and action by shooting on the fly, and the images in a photographer’s portfolio can hint at that skill. For example, the adventure and travel work in <a href="http://www.ryanheffernan.com/">Ryan Heffernan’s</a> book helped him win a 25-shot library for the pest control company <a href="http://landing.terminix.com/ppc/b?MarketingPartner=Google&amp;AdType=CPC&amp;mkwid=sOfDrUEkj_dc|pcrid|30534578939&amp;keyword=terminex&amp;pmt=e&amp;mm_campaign=614EE9C837646C863AD0BC9BC7BA0A72&amp;group=Terminex&amp;campaign=Terminix__TOP_EXACT&amp;dimension=Brand&amp;gclid=CKOelqPe18ICFU4V7AodlggAJg">Terminex</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>Lindsay Tyler, senior art buyer at <a href="http://chi.havasworldwide.com/">Havas Worldwide Chicago</a>, who hired Heffernan for the job, explains, “When you think about someone who focuses on catching that kind of action, I think it’s someone who thinks on their feet and can thrive in a situation where you have to get a lot done in a little bit of time.” She says of Heffernan, “He’s shooting stills in an almost cinematic way, and I think that lends itself well to getting a lot of images.”</p>
<p>Still, Tyler says that it’s through talking with photographers that she can best gauge their ability to cover a long shot list fast. She says that Heffernan won her confidence by talking about his relationship with a producer who helps him work efficiently, and describing his style of shooting subjects in action on past shoots. It’s important that shooters can work with talent, Tyler says, “making sure they can catch that right angle in a sort of rolling shoot style, rather than a very set up, stringent shoot style.”</p>
<p><strong>Solid Production Skills</strong></p>
<p>Getting a high volume of images of every scenario requires good production skills, specifically an ability to work efficiently. Tom Gorton, creative director at <a href="http://www.jacobsonrost.com/">Jacobson/Rost</a>, says he’s found these skills in <a href="http://www.kevinarnoldphoto.com/">Kevin Arnold</a>, the British Columbia-based photographer he’s hired to shoot three libraries for the MillerCoors brand Leinenkugel’s. “I look at Kevin Arnold like a sniper in the jungle who is able to get out ahead of problems and find solutions on the fly,” Gorton says.</p>
<p>Arnold, who has also shot libraries for Sperry Topsider, Canada Tourism and other clients, notes, “If you think through every little detail [in advance], then when you’re shooting, there is at least the possibility that any shot you make will be usable in the final art work,” he says. Arnold says he prefers to use talent who already know each other; that helps him photograph realistic interactions and emotions as soon as the shoot begins. He also likes to have his models wear layers so they can change quickly. He explains that he doesn’t want to lose a great picture of a man picking up an apple barrel, for instance, just because the guy’s wearing the wrong shoes.</p>
<p>He also keeps in mind that his clients need images for many platforms. Arnold says, “I end up overshooting because when I shoot a scenario, I go in and shoot horizontal, vertical, a couple plates of the background, step back and take a wide shot of the same scenario.”</p>
<p>However, he says that good storytelling requires him to “allow for organic, unplanned moments to come to light on set.” For Leinenkugel’s, he created stories by shooting both requested images—of friends eating lunch, swimming and roasting s’mores—and unplanned moments that couldn’t escape his ever-present lens. “I use the storyboarded shots as keystones to the shoot that I then shoot around.”</p>
<p>Reilly says that producing a library shoot comes down to getting as many of the required images as possible out of each location. Shooting in a home for Blue Cross Blue Shield, for example, “We were able to break the home up and shoot a senior citizen working out in the driveway, two middle-age guys playing instruments on the patio, kids running in the backyard, and another kid practicing a big tuba inside the house.”</p>
<p>During pre-production, art buyers value realistic problem-solving. Says Energy BBDO’s Miller Gershfeld, “We are all being asked to do more for less, and I really prefer and respect a photographer who will tell us what is possible within our limitations rather than over promising.”</p>
<p><strong>Anticipating, and Solving, Problems</strong></p>
<p>Jessica McCutcheon, a project manager at <a href="http://saatchix.com/sd-us/">Saatchi &amp; Saatchi X</a>, says the preparation San Francisco-based <a href="http://www.knphoto.com/">Katrine Naleid</a>, her producers and production coordinator did helped them deliver a 250-shot library for Walmart. Naleid and her team had only three weeks to construct a six-day shoot with a cast of 88 babies and 34 adults. Naleid’s planning included detailed lighting diagrams so her crew could always be pre-lighting a couple setups ahead.</p>
<p>Heffernan says scheduling can be one of the biggest challenges of library shoots. “That’s where you have to take the abstract and put the puzzle together and make sure, based on experience, that you’re not under-scheduling or trying to be overly ambitious,” he says. “The challenge is to make sure you’re giving yourself ample opportunity in case you do need a little extra time to light something or the weather changes.”</p>
<p>Carving out extra time in an unconventional way helped Reilly win a bid for a Blue Cross Blue Shield library of 250 images last year. Two other photographers had given estimates to the health insurance company’s shop, mcgarrybowen, based on a budget that allowed for eight or nine shoot days. But neither could deliver 250 images under that constraint. Reilly found a way to make it feasible.</p>
<p>“He was that rare guy who said, ‘I think we could totally do this if you allow me to pick off some of these on my own with some direction from you,’” Cartland says.</p>
<p>The client was seeking visuals for business-to-business media for <a href="http://www.livefearlessnc.com/">a campaign called “Live Fearless,”</a> celebrating living a unique life. With the goal of the campaign in mind, Reilly was able to photograph about 50 usable images before the actual shoot. Among his images: men playing mud football, a scene Reilly happened upon that was similar to a scenario on the shot list.</p>
<p>“I grabbed my cameras and told [co-producer Heather Smith] to meet me at the field with a stack of releases and a stack of money” to cover model fees, Reilly says. “The guys were completely down with us shooting as long as we didn’t interrupt their game, and that [continuous play] was exactly what we wanted.”</p>]]></article_text>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<strong>Client: </strong><em>Metropolis</em> magazine
<p><strong>Photo editor (former):</strong> Magda Biernat</p>
<p>Having started out shooting architecture, photographer <a href="http://www.tycole.com/">Ty Cole</a> is keenly interested in the environments in which he shoots his portraits, and likes to use the space to create a graphic composition. For “The Makers” issue of <em><a href="http://www.metropolismag.com/">Metropolis</a></em>, the magazine on design and architecture, then photo editor Magda Biernat assigned Cole to create environmental portraits of fabricators, people who make art pieces, architectural details and other designs either on their own or to the specifications of designers and artisans. “The specific assignment was to show them in their studios and the tools they use,” Cole explains.</p>
<p>Cole, who is based in Brooklyn, landed the assignment on the strength of a personal project he had done, making portraits of metal fabricators in Brooklyn, which he had shared via email and a printed promotion. The promotion demonstrated he could handle one of the tougher requirements of the <em>Metropolis</em> assignment: Creating interesting compositions in sparse or industrial spaces using the tools and materials his subjects work with. “When I shoot these things I want the environment to be as interesting as the subject,” he says. “I try to have a strong composition, so your eye moves around the scene.” In each space, he looks around for the props and tools the subjects use, to see if he can bring them into the frame. They can help him build the composition, “and if they have a personal connection to the subject, that’s a bonus too.”</p>
<p>After he had made two of the portraits that <em>Metropolis</em> needed shot in New York City, the magazine was planning to hire another photographer to shoot Jason Pilarski and Steven Joyner, owners of <a href="http://www.machinehistories.com/">MachineHistories</a>, a Los Angeles company that provides “industrial means for producing non-standard objects.”</p>
<p>But by coincidence, Cole was heading to California on vacation. He told <em>Metropolis</em> that if they could wait two weeks, he would be happy to shoot the assignment in Los Angeles. He adds, “It’s a good thing I did because it became the cover. “</p>
<p><strong>Logistics</strong></p>
<p>As on many of his portrait assignments, Cole was photographing subjects who are not used to being in front of the camera, and needed to put them at ease. His fascination with the work that MachineHistories produces helped him build a rapport with Pilarski and Joyner as soon as he arrived and began scouting the space. “When I am looking for stuff in the studio, I get them to explain the tools they use and products they’ve fabricated, and I start bouncing ideas off of them,” he explains. “By the time they’re ready to get their picture taken, they’re already interested and ready to go.”</p>
<p>Cole was fascinated by a complicated spiral sculpture that was cut from wood, and he moved that towards their workspace where he would photograph the duo, placing it just to the left. For one shot (see opposite page), “I needed something on the right,” he says. He found a sheet of wood with circles cut out of it. He used this to form a wall to the right of his subjects.</p>
<p>“The wood cut out thing on the right moves your eye back to [the subjects]—and that was the point,” Cole says.</p>
<p>He noticed a tall light made up of four fluorescent light bulbs. Thinking it was an interesting object, he decided to bring it into the frame of his photo and incorporate the glow from the four bulbs into his lighting setup.</p>
<p>Composing the objects in the space is his first step, he says. Once those are set, his lights are set, and he’s framed his shot in camera, then he brings in the subjects. “Body position and body language are important for a portrait: How am I going to place them, how should they be in relation to each other?” He gave the two subjects minimal instructions, he says. “It’s: put your arm up, try putting your hand in your pocket. You get them to loosen up.” But most of the work of putting them at ease was already done. Cole says, “I’m setting the tone for the whole shoot. If you love what you do, it naturally comes off that way.”</p>
<p><strong>Lighting</strong></p>
<p>To create a strong keylight, he placed a MOLA beauty disk with diffusion on a stand about 10–12 feet high at camera right. “It’s not super big or super small. It’s directional, not soft, “ says Cole, who always uses Profoto lights. The high keylight, he notes, “was going to give shape to the sculpture.”</p>
<p>To open up shadow areas, he placed a large Chimera softbox directly behind his camera and tripod. “You want it no higher than eye level because you want to get light under the chin and in the contours of the face.”</p>
<p>The final light he brought in came from the MachineHistories studio—the light fixture with fluorescent bars. Cole positioned it slightly behind and to the left of the wooden sculpture. In addition to providing an interesting graphic element, Cole says, “It provided a subtle kick light.” It helped light the wooden spiral sculpture, and also added a touch of light on Pilarski’s cheek.</p>
<p><strong>Camera</strong></p>
<p>Canon 5D Mark III, with a 24–105mm lens (shot at 40mm), f/5.6 at 1/60 sec. “I wanted the shutter to burn in the fluorescents,” he explains.</p>
<p>He shot all the portraits for the assignment on a tripod. “I’m on a tripod probably 95 percent of the time because I originally shot architecture,” he says. “I try to make sure my composition is strong and lock it down, then bring the people in and direct them.”</p>
<p>Locking in the camera’s settings and fixing its position on a tripod keeps each of his shots consistent, which helps when he needs to composite pieces from multiple shots. He says, “That happens quite often.” As it turns out, he needed to composite a shot for the <em>Metropolis </em>assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Post Production</strong></p>
<p>Cole sent <em>Metropolis</em> a small edit, noting his favorite shots and which shot he thought showed each subject the best. Among the favorites Cole has shared in his promotions and on his website is a horizontal image of Pilarski leaning on the sculpture and Joyner seated to the right.</p>
<p>Cole had also shot some verticals for the assignment, and <em>Metropolis</em> decided to use one of these as the cover of “The Makers” issue. To produce the cover image, Cole got permission to silhouette the figure of Joyner from one shot, drop him into an image where he liked Pilarski’s pose and expression, and then composite a different head shot of Joyner’s head onto his body. Because he had kept the lighting and camera settings consistent, the highlights and shadows were nearly identical in each of the shots. “The body language hadn’t changed much,” he adds, making the compositing fairly easy. The only other retouching, he did, he says, was to correct color and tone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cole often does his own retouching. “I’m a control freak,” he explains. “Sometimes the easiest way to explain to someone what you want is to do it first and show them, and by then I’ve already done it.”</p>
<p>Though it was not Cole’s first magazine cover, he considers the <em>Metropolis</em> job a turning point in his career, helping him land more editorial and commercial assignments of his favorite subjects—interesting people in interesting spaces.</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[This place. It’s a phrase that, depending on one’s perspective, might be spoken in celebration, reverence, contempt, anger, frustration or exhaustion when referring to Israel and the West Bank. There are so many opinions about this place—such strong feelings, so much conflict, so much history, such conviction. <em>This place.</em>
<p>When photographer <a href="http://www.fredericbrenner.com/">Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Brenner</a> imagined bringing several photographers to Israel and the West Bank to create bodies of work there, he hoped to confound the existing political and religious narratives. He thought that artists (or “poets,” as he calls the photographers), rather than reporters, might find a way to go beyond what he calls the “dual perspective—for/against, victim/perpetrator,” that dominates popular perception of Israel and the West Bank. “Israel is a place where everybody instrumentalizes one another and is being instrumentalized,” Brenner said during an interview with <em>PDN</em> earlier this year. “I believed that only through poetic speech could people maybe touch something of the unbearable complexity of this place.”</p>
<p>After researching Israel and the West Bank for two years, Brenner began to organize and seek funding for the project in 2007, eventually securing the participation of 11 colleagues—Wendy Ewald, Martin Kollar, Josef Koudelka, Jungjin Lee, Gilles Peress, Fazal Sheikh, Stephen Shore, Rosalind Fox Solomon, Thomas Struth, Jeff Wall and Nick Waplington.</p>
<p>Jeff Rosenheim, currently the head of the photography department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, worked for two years as a consultant for the project. Then Charlotte Cotton, former head of the photography department at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, stepped in and became the project’s curator. Dubbed “<a href="http://this-place.org/">This Place</a>,” the exhibition opened in October of this year at DOX Centre for Contemporary Art in Prague, where it will show through March, 2015, before touring Tel Aviv Museum of Art in Israel, Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, Florida, and the Brooklyn Museum of Art in New York. MACK Books also <a href="http://www.mackbooks.co.uk/books/1049-This-Place.html">published a catalogue of the work</a>, and each photographer has published, or plans to publish, his or her own books as well.</p>
<p>Brenner, who lives in Paris, drew inspiration for the project from the Mission photographique de la DATAR, for which 28 photographers were commissioned to document the French landscape in the 1980s. The documentary photography commissioned by the United States Farm Security Administration and Office of War Information between 1935 and 1944 was also a reference point.</p>
<p>Initially Brenner brought the photographers to Israel on “an exploratory mission” to investigate “the largest possible spectrum of narratives,” he explains. The idea was “to get them totally confused, but on a very high level, and by doing so create a vacuum out of which they would start addressing their questions and define their own working hypothesis.”</p>
<p>“I was dubious about it,” <a href="http://www.gf.org/fellows/17203-wendy-ewald">Wendy Ewald</a> recalls. “I felt Israel was a place that was so much written about that it would be very difficult to figure out a new way to look at it.” Ewald agreed to go on the exploratory mission “with the feeling I could always back out.”</p>
<p>Brenner organized “an informal think tank” of “writers, psychoanalysts, architects, social activists,” with whom the photographers were able to meet, Brenner explains. “For each of them, it was a transformative experience,” he says. “That was a very interesting trip,” Ewald recalls. “There was a lot of discussion and interesting tension, not between us, but in how we felt we would deal with actually doing the project, and what were the parameters and what were the politics. That’s something you don’t generally get to experience with other photographers; generally you are working on your own.”</p>
<p>There were no assignments or restrictions. All of the funding came from foundations and collectors, Brenner says. Eighty percent of that came from the United States, with 20 percent coming from Europe. “It would have been easy to get some money from institutions in Israel, but the obligations that would have been attached to it were too big,” Brenner explains.</p>
<p>Initially there were six photographers, excluding Brenner. Eventually the number grew to 12, with Brenner deciding late in the project to contribute his own book to the project. Matthew Brogan, who served as the project director for This Place, says of the 12 collaborators, “Everybody had the question: ‘What’s behind this, what’s the agenda?’”</p>
<p>Stephen Shore says that when he first learned of Brenner’s idea, he wasn’t “particularly interested in [the project] as a collective effort.” As the project evolved, however, he “found that the group aspect was very useful because it took away the pressure to do something definitive, which I’m not sure is possible anywhere, let alone Israel and the West Bank.”</p>
<p>“Whatever they thought their project was going to be at the beginning, it isn’t what their project turned out to be,” says Brogan. Ewald, whose work involves giving cameras to subjects and encouraging them to depict their own lives, began her This Place project at two schools and a girls’ military academy in Nazareth. As people began suggesting places she should go and work, her project expanded rapidly. Eventually she worked with 14 communities in Israel and the West Bank, including shopkeepers in Jerusalem, tech professionals in Tel Aviv, and a Palestinian gypsy community. “I became fascinated with the complexity and trying to map out all of the difference in the country,” she explains. It was the first time Ewald utilized digital cameras, which allowed her to work more quickly and with a wider range of people.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.martinkollar.com/field-trip">Martin Kollar</a> worked in Tel Aviv and other coastal areas. He photographed military, scientific and mining facilities he researched and gained access to, as well as landscapes he came across by chance.</p>
<p><a href="http://aperture.org/shop/books/wall-josef-koudelka-books?SID=ars8623kimkb2vffm1nc0ehji3.">Josef Koudelka</a>, whom Brenner says insisted on paying his own way for his exploratory trip because he anticipated declining Brenner’s invitation to participate, created a series of photographs of the barrier wall separating Israel and the West Bank. <a href="http://www.jungjinlee.com/">Jungjin Lee</a>, who prints her images on special Korean mulberry paper to add layers of texture and materiality, made photographs in the desert regions in Israel’s south.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&amp;VF=MAGO31_9_VForm&amp;ERID=24KL53ZNTZ">Gilles Peress</a>, the last photographer to join the group, continued a long-term project photographing the Road of the Patriarchs, which runs from Hebron to Jerusalem, and Silwan, a Palestinian village in East Jerusalem. <a href="http://www.fazalsheikh.org/">Fazal Sheikh</a> also continued a long-term body of work that considers the reverberations of the creation of the state of Israel. For This Place, he created a new series, "Desert Bloom," which depicts the desert from above, exploring the different ways conflict has shaped the landscape.</p>
<p><a href="http://stephenshore.net/">Shore</a> used a variety of techniques and three different cameras to create a body of work that included landscapes, architectural photographs, portraits and views of everyday life. Shore also made photographs on archeological digs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rosalindsolomon.com/">Rosalind Fox Solomon</a> traveled the country mostly by bus, making black-and-white portraits of people she encountered along the way, and images of the landscape. <a href="http://www.mackbooks.co.uk/books/1053-Thomas-Struth.html">Thomas Struth</a> photographed landscapes, architecture, families and technology during six trips to Israel and the West Bank between 2009 and 2014.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jeff-wall/biography/">Jeff Wall</a>, who is known for staged, large-scale images, worked for several weeks in 2011 with Bedouin olive pickers on a farm, to recreate a scene of them sleeping outside at dawn. He’d observed them initially during his exploratory trip in 2010. <a href="http://www.mackbooks.co.uk/books/1034-Settlement.html">Nick Waplington</a> focused his work on more than 200 Jewish settlements in the West Bank, creating landscapes and portraits.</p>
<p>Brenner’s book, <em>An Archeology of Fear and Desire</em>, is comprised primarily of environmental portraits, and also landscapes. Brenner’s work reflects his “hypothesis” of Israel as a place of “radical otherness, a place where every single person is the other of somebody else.”</p>
<p>In considering the cumulative project, represented in 12 monographs, a traveling exhibition and a catalogue, Shore notes that the different interests and voices of the photographers “may get to some of the complexity and richness of the place.”</p>
<p>Brenner says he hopes the work “will disrupt the kind of polarized conversation [about Israel and Palestine] that exist,” and “create some space where there can be a different conversation with different perspectives.”</p>
<p>Brenner notes that the assembled project, with its wide range of photographic visions, is fragmentary and “dissonant,” aspects of the work that he hadn’t anticipated, but which turned out to be important.</p>
<p>“Will [viewers] dare to open themselves to dissonance?” he wonders. “Will people dare not to understand this place?”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[As brands and the agencies that represent them focus more energy—and money—on creating social media content that reaches audiences on apps like Instagram, Tumblr and Vine, they’re looking for photographers who understand the looser style of social media, have strong creative voices and, for certain jobs, large social media followings. As a result, photographers and their reps are altering their marketing strategies to take advantage of this growing market. <em>PDN</em> recently spoke with clients about how they hire photographers for social media jobs, and reps about how they are marketing their photographers for these assignments. 
<p><strong>Big Following Not a Prerequisite</strong></p>
<p>It’s true that many photographers with big social followings have been hired by clients that want to take advantage of their “influencer” status, but a big following on Instagram or Tumblr isn’t a prerequisite to landing social media work. Brands that have their own social followings don’t need to partner with Instagrammers to attract attention: They need high-quality imagery shot by professionals.</p>
<p>“My photographers aren’t getting work based on the number of their social media followers, but for the nature and integrity of their work,” says rep Sherry Riad of <a href="http://riadrepresents.com/">RIAD Represents</a>, whose photographers have worked on native advertising campaigns for brands like Visa and Nike.</p>
<p>Dara Siegel of <a href="http://iheartreps.com/">I Heart Reps</a> says she’s seen a “huge jump” in the need for “unique and professional social media content” recently. “Everyone thought social media was going to kill professional photographers, when in fact [clients] are going back to professional photographers to fill social media content, because they want it to be done right.”</p>
<p>Siegel notes that budgets for social media campaigns are “growing pretty quickly...They’re not these $500-a-day things any more.”</p>
<p>Amy Yvonne Yu, senior integrated content producer for “ideas and innovation” agency <a href="http://www.akqa.com/">AKQA</a>, says that when she’s hiring a commercial shooter for a social media project for a client that doesn’t require a photographer with a big following, “If the creative is right, I don’t care about the rest.”</p>
<p><strong>Showing Social Style</strong></p>
<p>As the need for social media content has risen, clients are looking for photographers who can shoot work that appears “native” to the social channels on which it’s published. Social media imagery often seems personal, and in social media advertising, the branding is seldom overt. “It’s more casual, it’s looser,” Siegel says.</p>
<p>She’s been integrating work into her photographers’ portfolios that feels social-media savvy, and will occasionally pull images from their social-media feeds for her website.</p>
<p>Jamie Appelbaum, a senior art producer with <a href="http://www.mcgarrybowen.com/">mcgarrybowen</a>, notes that the look of mobile content is “completely different” from traditional ads. “A lot of people have mobile as part of their websites now,” and will highlight that work in its own portfolio.</p>
<p>Yu says that she wants to see social media work by a photographer that looks like what she’s hiring them for, just like any other assignment. She wants to “see the type of storytelling [a photographer does] and their eye for specific content, be it for a brand’s blog or their Instagram or Facebook.” She’s often hiring photographers to shoot social media content in tandem with a commercial production, but such shoots take special skills and collaboration. “I need to see that they’re capable of [shooting in tandem],” she says.</p>
<p><a href="http://keenaphoto.com/">Justin Keena</a>, a photographer represented by RIAD who has shot social media work for Visa, has been a good fit for social media jobs because his work is “all about adventure,” Riad says. “He gets people to do crazy stuff and documents that, and it feels real, it feels organic, it’s got high energy, and it’s definitely something that would attract attention [on social channels].” The native advertising work Keena has recently produced for Visa “is not about driving sales,” Riad adds. “People don’t like to be blatantly sold to on social platforms: It’s about engaging content and brand culture.”</p>
<p>Riad says that she views social media as an important part of strengthening the personal brands of the photographers she represents. “My photographers have an active social media presence [and use it] as a tool to promote themselves as a total package, not just to show what they do, but who they are.”</p>
<p><strong>Instagram as Portfolio</strong></p>
<p>When visual apps like Instagram and Vine were released, many pro photographers used them to experiment, mostly for fun. As the market for social media content has grown, however, clients are looking seriously at what photographers publish on their personal feeds. “I use social media to monitor how photographers and reps sell themselves,” Yu says. “You’d be surprised how poorly some of them do. It’s another way for me to see: Do you understand how social media works? How do you present yourself? What kind of following are you trying to get, and what kind of voice are you trying to get across?”</p>
<p>Big inconsistencies between the quality of the work in a photographer’s portfolio and on their social media feeds can be a turn off, Yu says. “Everybody needs to edit,” she counsels. “Social media is yet another channel for you to present yourself professionally.”</p>
<p>Appelbaum says that when she and her colleagues at mcgarrybowen are looking for photographers to hire, “we look a lot at social media and we see what kind of images they’re putting up there.”</p>
<p>What photographers publish on their social media channels can help clients understand if their work is appropriate for a brand. When Alex Milwee, a vice president at <a href="http://www.edelmandigital.com/">Edelman Digital</a>, the interactive arm of the public relations firm, wants to hire photographers for clients, he looks “to see if the imagery and the people that they’re featuring are in line with the brand” for which he’s commissioning content.</p>
<p>Photographers also sometimes become de facto spokespeople for brands through their social media feeds, and that can lead to work. When Yu needed to hire photographers to shoot still images for Air Jordan’s social media channels at the NBA All-Star game last year, she worked with photographers that she knew had an affinity for the brand because they’d posted about Air Jordan shoes and apparel on their own social media feeds.</p>
<p><strong>The Following Factor</strong></p>
<p>In addition to evaluating a photographer’s esthetic fit for a campaign, some brands do hire photographers with big social media followings and ask those photographers to publish work on their social channels. Some of these photographers are professionals who happen to have large social followings, while others are primarily known for their social media cache.</p>
<p>Rumors of Instagrammers promoting brands for meager compensation have made professional photographers and reps cringe, but Yu argues that photographers with big followings are in a good position to negotiate if the brand wants them to publish work on their personal feeds. “If you have a big enough following and your audience fits in with the client, you have the upper hand in negotiating,” Yu says. Photographers who are bidding on jobs will use their followings as a selling point, she adds. “You’re providing media in that instance, which is of huge value,” she says.</p>
<p>Siegel says that, when one of her photographers with a big following did a social media campaign for a major auto manufacturer, the client asked if the photographer would post images to his personal Instagram feed. Siegel declined because she felt like there wasn’t enough compensation. When photographers post for brands on their personal feeds, they’re tying themselves to the brand, and risking alienating their audience by publishing ads. “It could be worthwhile if the price was [high] enough, or the brand has a certain appeal that feels authentic to the photographer, or the photographer has a real belief in the brand,” she says.</p>
<p>Photographers who align themselves with one brand by posting ads on their personal feeds may also preclude themselves from getting work from a competitive brand. Milwee says that one of the first things he checks when he’s considering working with a photographer for an Edelman Digital client is whether or not they’ve worked with a competitive brand. “If they have, it makes it hard to justify a partnership,” he says.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Social Media Opportunities</strong></p>
<p>Clients are hiring photographers for a range of work to be used on social media channels. Understanding the types of social media work available can help photographers position themselves for those jobs.</p>
<p>At the top end are shoots that are art-directed and produced similarly to traditional advertising jobs, but that are shot primarily for social media usage. Dara Siegel of I Heart Reps notes, “10–20 percent of the shoots that we’re doing are social media-based.”</p>
<p>Clients are also enlisting photographers to “piggyback” on television and print ad productions to shoot social media content. “Because budgets have been so thin, you have still shoots piggybacking off of commercials, and then you have social-media shoots that are piggybacking off of both of those to maximize content creation,” notes Amy Yvonne Yu, senior integrated art producer for AKQA. photographers brought in to shoot social-media content on a larger production are often asked to produce behind-the-scenes shots, she says.</p>
<p>Photographers are being hired to photograph events on behalf of clients, as well. Edelman digital, the interactive arm of the public relations firm, hired four photographers to go to the Los Angeles Auto Show to shoot images for a client, Volkswagen. The images were published both on Volkswagen’s Instagram feed, and on the feeds of the photographers, says Alex Milwee, an Edelman digital vice president. The photographers were chosen, in part, because they have large Instagram followings that the brand wanted to reach.</p>
<p><a href="http://bryanderballa.com/">Bryan Derballa</a>, a photographer Siegel represents, has been working with J. Crew creating images for their social media accounts at events like New York Fashion Week. Siegel says her photographers have also been hired to take over Instagram feeds for brands, working with minimal art direction. One of the more interesting things about social media work, she says, is that “there’s tons of creative freedom.”</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[Photo books remain the preferred medium of photographers, and its stature has grown in recent years with no signs of slowing down. Here, the editors of <em>PDN</em> highlight some of the most notable photo books of 2014.
<p class="p3"><strong>Memory City&nbsp;<img alt="" style="float: right;" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/RADIUS_Memory-City_1_Abstract.jpg" /><br />
Alex Webb and Rebecca Norris Webb&nbsp;<br />
</strong>Radius Books<br />
152 pages, 65 color images<br />

<p class="p1"><em>Memory City </em>combines the rich, brilliant street photography of Alex Webb with the contemplative, metaphorical work of his wife, Rebecca Norris Webb. Made during five trips to Rochester, New York, between April 2012 and April 2013, the photographs are an elegy to the city, to Kodak film, and to the passage of time. Rochester prospered for more than 150 years, driven mostly by the success and largess of Eastman Kodak. But de-industrialization— and Kodak’s failure to adapt as photography went digital—threw Rochester into decline. The film giant has shut down most of its production lines, laid off thousands of workers, and declared bankruptcy. “This book is a photographic exploration of Rochester...during what may very well be the last days of film&nbsp;as we know it,” the Webbs write. Alex Webb laments the disappearance of Kodachrome film, which he used for more than 30 years. Now, he explains, Kodachrome can be processed only as black-and-white negative film “that produces an image that seems distressed, almost weathered.” Interspersed among his (digital) color images of Rochestarians soldiering on through hard times are poignant black-and-white Kodachrome images of empty parking&nbsp;lots, deserted streets and overgrown cemeteries. One of the more striking black-and-white images is a rush hour scene that evokes the ghost of more prosperous days. In her take on Rochester, Rebbecca Norris Webb uses a more conceptual approach. Like a delicate silk or satin dress, she explains, “film has accompanied us to dance after dance, wedding after wedding...” The comparison inspired her to explore Rochester by photographing prom, wedding, and other ceremonial dresses, as well as portraits of Rochester women, past and present. The Webbs have distinct styles, but <em>Memory City </em>underscores what they have in common: an ability to pack the frame with emotional and intellectual substance, and make it beautiful, too.<br />

<p class="p1"><strong>Red Ball of a Sun Slipping Down&nbsp;<img alt="" style="float: right;" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/MANYFACES_Red_Ball_RICHARDS1_Abstract.jpg" /><br />
Eugene Richards&nbsp;<br />
</strong>Many Voices Press&nbsp;<br />
112 pages, 52 photos&nbsp;<br />

<p class="p1">The photos in Eugene Richards’s new book were taken over&nbsp;the course of 40 years in the Arkansas Delta, an area where&nbsp;he made some of his first documentary photos. Richards arrived in this poor rural area in 1969 as a VISTA volunteer, stayed for four years, and returned several times. A word that summarizes the book is “poetic.” While some of the older black- and-white images are direct, many of the newer color photos are sensitively expressive and allusive: a railroad crossing seen through a rain-swept windshield, a tight close-up of a woman’s tearstained face and clenched hands, sequined red slippers seen through a hazy window. A single line of text, like a fragment of a poem, appears on the left-hand page opposite each photo: Together the lines make up a story of the photographer and&nbsp;a family he had come to know in the region. Like a poem, the book is a compressed expression of layers of meaning. It’s a meditation on memory, loss, aging, a photographer’s obligation to a subject, and the passage of time.</p>
<p class="p1">The title is an allusion to sunset, the moment when the world changes color and day turns to night. Richards describes sitting with a woman we know only as Porter Lee and her grandchildren on her porch as they watch the sun sliding toward the horizon. Then Richards wakes and slowly realizes he is in his motel room. He looks at his face in the mirror, appraises how it’s aged, thinks of events in his life and the people he’s lost since he first left Porter Lee and her family. The images in the book are not organized chronologically. A photo of a black man picking cotton under the eyes of a white field boss appears near an image of white men hoeing a field. Which is the image taken soon after the end of Jim Crow, and which<br />
is the modern image? The captions, printed in the back of the book, offer a key, but we are left to wonder if anything has changed in this quiet rural area, except the perspectives of the man taking the photos.&nbsp;<br />

<p class="p1"><strong>Hidden Islam&nbsp;<img alt="" style="float: right;" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/hidden-islam-cover-abstract.jpg" /><br />
By Nicolo Degiorgis</strong><br />
Introduction by Martin Parr<br />
Rorhof<br />
90 pages; 45 gatefolds<br />
$80 <a href="http://www.rorhof.com/">www.rorhof.com</a></p>
<p class="p1">What distinguishes a photobook from a photo essay or an exhibition? Photographers trying to turn a widely seen series into a book face a particular challenge if they want to do more than simply print an online slide show on paper. With Nicolo Degiorgis’s <em>Hidden Islam</em>, featuring the photographer’s images of the makeshift places of worship that Muslims have created in northeastern Italy, he more than meets the challenge. The book’s ingenious design is consonant with the content, and brings to life the “hidden” nature of his subject.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">The 6.5 x 9.5-inch volume looks like a guidebook. The cover shows a map of northeastern Italy—the area in which Degiorgis lives and works—and a small chart listing “Islamic Makeshift Places of Worship” by type: shops, supermarkets, discos. Inside, each page shows a single, small, black-and-white photo of a nondescript building and lists the postal code where the site is located: So far, so dull. But each right-hand page is a gatefold; when opened, it reveals a color photo of the space inside the building that has been turned into a mosque. Some of the color photos show several rows of worshippers bowing in prayer; others depict a few men talking or removing their shoes before worship; a few of the images show spaces that are empty except for a patchwork of prayer rugs. Each photo is shot at a discreet distance from the worshippers: The photographer is an outsider looking in on a world hidden from passersby.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">As photographer Martin Parr notes in the book's introduction, there are 1.5 million Muslims in Italy, but the government officially recognizes only eight mosques; some Italian municipalities have banned the construction of new ones. The mosques Degiorgis photographed have been improvised to fill a need. The problem is particularly acute in the northeastern provinces, the seat of an anti-immigration party hostile to the accommodation of the country’s Muslims.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">(Not that northern Italy holds a monopoly on hostility to Islam. One Friday afternoon in Manhattan, the driver of the cab I was riding in mentioned that he would be hurrying to get to Friday prayers as soon as he dropped me off. When I asked what mosque he attends, he described the location of an apartment building whose secondary use was unknown to me in the five years I had lived around the corner. “We don’t like to advertise,” he explained.)</p>
<p class="p1">Faith, being largely internal, is a tricky subject for photography. <em>Hidden Islam</em> illustrates the resilience of&nbsp; faithful people who practice their devotions in the face of obstacles. The warm, colorful photos of people gathered in prayer, in contrast to the drab exterior shots, illustrate the vibrancy of life in community—one of the most appealing aspects of religious practice.</p>
<p class="p1">The winner of the 2014 Rencontres d’Arles Author Book Award and the Paris Photo-Aperture Foundation First PhotoBook Award, <em>Hidden Islam</em> is currently sold out, but a third edition is due in January.<br />

<p class="p1"><strong><em>Danny Clinch: Still Moving <img alt="" style="float: right;" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/ABRAMS_DannyClinch1_Abstract.jpg" /></em><br />
By Danny Clinch<br />
</strong>Abrams<br />
296 pages; 200 photographs<br />
$50; <a href="http://abramsbooks.com/"><span class="s1">abramsbooks.com</span></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em>Danny Clinch: Still Moving </em>is a journey through Clinch’s diverse portfolio from the last three decades. The book’s 200 color and black-and-white images, almost all of them at full bleed, encompass a wide variety of musicians, bands, genres and photographic styles. Let the record show that Danny Clinch is much more than just a “rock” photographer. He’s arguably one of the most accomplished and versatile photographers and film directors of his generation. He’s shot editorial assignments (<em>Rolling Stone</em>, <em>Vanity Fair</em>, <em>GQ </em>and <em>The New York Times Magazine</em>), advertising campaigns (American Express, Advil, Gap) and album artwork (Nas, Bruce Springsteen, Black Keys). He’s directed music videos (Pearl Jam, The Avett Brothers, Ben Harper, and Tom Waits) and even a few documentaries (Tim McGraw and the Bonnaroo music festival), concert DVDs (Foo Fighters and John Mayer) and many print ads and commercials for long-time music-lover and fashion designer John Varvatos. Clinch’s work has been presented in numerous galleries, and he’s published two previous books: <em>Discovery Inn </em>(1998) and <em>When the Iron Bird Flies: Tibetan Freedom Concerts 1996-1999</em>, both of which include a wide variety of work made in 1980s and 1990s.</p>
<p class="p2">This latest book is comprised of five chapters: Documentary, Friends &amp; Family, Backstage, Live and Portraits. Each chapter draws you into the next. Clinch captures the subject’s personality in each image, whether posed or candid, on stage or backstage. A particularly interesting feature of the book is the image pairing and sequencing. <em>Still Moving </em>combines then-and-now images of various artists, both famous and less well-known or emerging artists. Among them are Eminem (2001), Eddie Vedder (2006), Foo Fighters (2005), Steven Tyler &amp; Joe Perry of Aerosmith (1997), Jackson Browne (2010), Blind Melon (1993), James Brown (2003), Jeff Beck (1999) and Gary Clark Jr. (2011). In another example of deft image pairing, a wide shot of Jay Z (2010) performing on stage in front of thousands of fans precedes a tight shot of Bruce Springsteen (2003), bending over backwards holding the microphone, seemingly onstage by himself.</p>
<p class="p2">The book captures the spirit of a celebrated music photographer and musician. <em>Still Moving </em>is an essential addition to the collection for Clinch fans.<br />

<p class="p2"><strong><em>Pikin Slee <img alt="" style="float: right;" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/PRESTEL_viviane-Sassen_Pikin_Slee_cover_Abstract.jpg" /></em><br />
</strong><strong>By Viviane Sassen<br />
</strong>Prestel<br />
120 pages, 93 images<br />
$40</p>
<p class="p2">Viviane Sassen has become world-renowned for her dream-like fashion images, collected in books like <em>Parasomnia </em>and <em>Flamboya</em>. Her boldest compositions combine brilliantly colored objects with bodies— typically, black bodies—posed at surprising angles to create graphic, striking and sometimes surreal compositions. In her new book, <em>Pikin Slee</em>, she once again explores juxtapositions of forms and shapes, but here her probing eye elevates mundane objects.</p>
<p class="p1">Sassen, who was born in the Netherlands and raised in Kenya, traveled in 2012 to Suriname, and stayed in a remote village called Pikin Slee on the Upper Suriname River, where people live without electricity or running water. Judging from the photos in the book, Sassen was equally fascinated by the natural world surrounding the village—she has several photos of leaves in the trees and the pattern of shadows they cast—as she was by people and the objects they use. In a photo of a boy wearing one yellow kitchen glove and dark blue pants, the glove appears searingly bright. She photographs a still life as an array of color: pale green vegetables on a blue cloth and a bright yellow bag. In her color images, the brightest objects are often manmade. Many images in the book are in black-and-white. In the absence of color, form becomes more noticeable, highlighting how Sassen’s eye was drawn to the shapes of branches, the shadows cast by leaves on a corrugated tin roof, or a piece of wood set at an angle to the door of a house. Sassen has said she went to Suriname seeking a simpler form of photography. In her photos of Pikin Slee, she boils photography down to its essence: inspiring us to take a second look at the world around us by showing us how it is transformed within the borders of a photo.<br />

<p class="p2"><strong><em>Liu Bolin <img alt="" style="float: right;" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/ABRAMS_Liu-BolinCOVER_Abstract.jpg" /></em><br />
</strong><strong>By Liu Bolin<br />
</strong>Abrams<br />
224 pages, 200 color images<br />
$60; <a href="http://abramsbooks.com/"><span class="s1">abramsbooks.com</span></a></p>
<p class="p2">On November 16, 2005, China’s government started evicting the residents of the Suojia Village International Arts Camp, a Beijing suburb that was home to hundreds of artists. Soon, they would demolish the neighborhood—and artist Liu Bolin’s studio—to make way for the infrastructure that would house the 2008 Olympic games.</p>
<p class="p2">But from the ashes of the arts community grew a silent protest. In the first image from his series, “Hiding in the City,” Bolin made a self-portrait in the ruins of his studio, camouflaged amongst the bricks of the hollowed-out space. He soon made more, blending into landmarks throughout China, and then in Italy, Paris, and New York, aiming a more subtle middle finger at the instruments of power than Ai Wei Wei’s “Study in Perspective.” As he explains, “Instead of saying that I simply disappear into the background, it would be better to say that the environment has engulfed me and that, consequently, I cannot afford to choose to be either active or passive.” These are the images that make up the bulk of his first monograph, <em>Liu Bolin</em>.</p>
<p class="p2">Part performance art, part painting and part photography, Bolin’s series of “hidden” portraits may be his vision, but in practice it is very much a collaboration. His team of assistants includes painters and photographers, and as his own most frequent subject, he is forced to relinquish at least some control—when he is being painted (always in his army fatigues), he must remain perfectly motionless for hours.</p>
<p class="p2">In a literal sense, his work is even more of a study in perspective than Ai Wei Wei’s. Eschewing any postproduction, Bolin’s team must line him up perfectly with the camera when painting, which often tests his physical endurance. On a particularly detail-rich scene at a New York newsstand, it took five days to blend him into the racks of magazines.</p>
<p class="p2">Fittingly, the popularity of Bolin’s work gave the invisible man increased exposure, leading to some high-profile collaborations. In New York, he collaborated with the artist JR, who wheat-pasted a giant portrait of Bolin to a wall in Manhattan, which Bolin subsequently painted himself into. When Jon Bon Jovi asked him</p>
<p class="p1">
to do the artwork for his band’s 2013 album <em>What About Now</em>, he reluctantly indulged his wife, a diehard fan. And in 2012, <em>Harper’s Bazaar </em>commissioned him to “hide” fashion designers Angela Missoni and Jean-Paul Gaultier, among others. Gaultier, at least, saw Bolin as a kindred spirit. “It’s very good for my work to be a chameleon,” Gaultier said. <br />

<p class="p2"><strong><em>The Return <img alt="" style="float: right;" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/copy.jpg" /></em><br />
</strong><strong>By Adrain Chesser in collaboration with ritualist Timothy White Eagle<br />
</strong>Daylight<br />
144 pages, 72 color images<br />
$49.95; <a href="http://daylightbooks.org/"><span class="s1">daylightbooks.org</span></a></p>
<p class="p2"><em>The Return </em>is a collection of quiet, beautiful photographs juxtaposed with preachy, strident text. Adrain Chesser’s images explore a subculture of young men and women who have dropped out of society to embrace the lifestyle of Native Americans—or at least their romantic notions of it. “Most come in one form or another from the disenfranchised margins of mainstream America. Most are poor, some are queer, some are transgender, some are hermits, and some are politically radical,” co-author Timothy White Eagle writes in the introduction, helpfully enough. Chesser’s images show his subjects hunting, gathering, and herding goats in the high deserts of the American West. “These willing pioneers are stepping off into uncertain terrain, searching for something lost generations ago. In their search, they struggle to be released from old ways of being. Cars, soda pop, cell phones and cigarettes follow them,” the introduction continues. Chesser shows the struggles and contradictions. His subjects head out in their SUVs, for instance. They stop at Burger King for a meal. And Chesser cuts through utopian illusions with images of unforgiving landscapes and occasional brutality. But he’s sympathetic to his subjects, and shows them on their own terms with an eye for gorgeous light, telling gesture, and detail. There are several images—“magpie,” “morning,” and “dressing a carcass” to name three—that are magnetic. But much of White Eagle’s text, which deifies Native American culture while vilifying modern industrial culture, is naive. For instance, he describes the book’s subjects as “uncommon heroes shedding layer by layer the learned domestication of the dominator culture.” Yeah? So we should all decamp to the wilderness with our bows and arrows? Savor Chesser’s images, dear readers, without mistaking them for a prescription for solving the world’s very complicated problems.<br />

<p class="p2"><strong><em>Angel Gitano: Men of Flamenco <img alt="" style="float: right;" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/RIZZOLI_ruven-afanador1_Abstract.jpg" /></em><br />
</strong><strong>Ruven Afanador<br />
</strong>Rizzoli<br />
240 pages, 142 black-and-white images<br />
$95; <a href="http://www.rizzoliusa.com/"><span class="s1">www.rizzoliusa.com</span></a></p>
<p class="p2">Ruven Afanador has a love affair with Andalusia. The southernmost autonomous community in Spain, it’s the birthplace of a culture that is internationally thought of as Spanish yet largely it’s own; particularly the bullfights and flamenco. Afanador has already paid homage to the bullfights (<em>Torero</em>, 2001), and the women of flamenco (<em>Mil Besos</em>, 2011), so with his latest tome, <em>Angel Gitano: Men of Flamenco</em>, the Colombian photographer focused on its men. The Gitanos are Spain’s Romani population, Gypsies who blended Andalusian song and dance with their own to create the famous flamenco.</p>
<p class="p2">Andalusia is almost as much of a character in the book as its subjects. Afanador describes it as“a universe inhabited by Gypsies, musicians, and...flamenco dancers,” which he plants in the wheat fields of Sevilla and the bleak landscapes of Jerez de la Frontera, dressed in dark but flamboyant outfits, or made up in his signature Italian Neo- realist theatrical makeup. “This is the region where the deepest roots of flamenco exist,” he said of Andalusia, speaking to the <em>The New Yorker </em>about <em>Mil Besos </em>in 2011.</p>
<p class="p2">But <em>Angel Gitano </em>stands in stark contrast to his portrait of flamenco’s women. It inhabits the same land, visual style and neo-classical esthetic, but unlike <em>Mil Besos</em>, <em>Angel Gitano </em>is overtly sexual. Afanador’s lustful gaze is felt throughout the book, with the often-nude dancers in almost feminine poses, albeit with muscular, masculine bodies seemingly carved from marble. While <em>Mil Besos </em>did not feature much nudity and felt, for the most part, asexual, <em>Angel Gitano </em>kicks you in the face with sex, right on the dramatic and perfectly executed cover.</p>
<p class="p2">For wardrobe, Afanador mixed his subjects’ own clothes—flamenco-style ruffled blouses and berets—with his more ostentatious tastes. Corsets, pants with high waists and wide bottoms, and long skirts are prevalent.</p>
<p class="p2">The 142 black-and-white images are bright and high-contrast, and mix paint and props to create his fantastical imagery. He counts Dali and Goya among his influences, as evidenced by a boy’s prosthetic horns, or another’s giant demon hands. But no matter his stylistic choices, it’s clear who are the stars of the show.</p>
<p class="p2">“I have always loved to photograph dancers,” he recently told <em>Out </em>magazine. “They work so hard on their bodies, and they are such great artists and collaborators.”<br />

<strong><em>Lakes and Reservoirs</em></strong><img alt="" style="float: right;" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/DAMIANI_Matthew-Brandt-COVER_Abstract.jpg" /><strong><br />
By Matthew Brandt<br />
</strong>Damiani/Yossi Milo<br />

<p class="p3">By soaking his C-prints in water from the lakes and reservoirs that his images depict, Matthew Brandt creates a stunning visual dialogue between photographer, image and subject. The unique prints that emerge from Brandt’s process occupy an area between abstraction and representation. Beyond appreciating the rich colors of his works, viewers are encouraged to consider the permanence of a photograph, and its ability to show us what we can’t otherwise see. The images also urge viewers to ponder the unique properties, history and potential of each individual body of water. Photographers, in particular, will wonder how much Brandt is able to control his technique.</p>
<p class="p3">Brandt began exhibiting his “Lakes and Reservoirs” prints a couple of years ago, and this book, co-published by Yossi Milo Gallery and Damiani, is the first large published collection of the work. Early in the book, he emphasizes the water’s role in his process by including images of the jugs he used to collect and store his water samples. The patterns and colors that emerge throughout the pages are surprisingly varied. The inky black and purple shapes in Brandt’s “Lake Isabella, CA 4” diptych recall graffiti lettering, while “Mary’s Lake, MT 5” looks like a pointillist painting.</p>
<p class="p3">Whether Brandt intended it or not, <em>lakes and Reservoirs </em>can also be read in the context of current discussions about water as a finite natural resource, and anxiety that water may be in short supply in years to come. One can’t help but look for the evidence of fresh water’s life-giving qualities when looking at Brandt’s images. As if this most important element of our world weren’t magical enough, water also happens to be capable of collaborating in the creation of compelling artworks.<br />

<p class="p3">It’s difficult to comprehend the meaning of the U.S. national defense budget—$526.6 billion for 2014, according to the Department of Defense. An-My L&ecirc;’s new book, <em>Events Ashore</em>, slightly clarifies the reality of our military industrial complex, the number of people it employs and the equipment it builds and maintains. To create the work, L&ecirc;, who was named a MacArthur Fellow in 2012, traveled around the globe photographing non-combat operations with a large-format camera and color negative film.</p>
<p class="p3">The speed, action and sense of peril common to news photographs of conflict are largely absent from her pictures. Instead, readers get the impression of a massive force lumbering deliberately across the globe, from Australia to Panama, Antarctica, Greenland and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="p3">In one image, divers stand on the ice-covered hull of the USS New Hampshire nuclear submarine, its sail jutting out of the pristine, otherwise empty white landscape of the Arctic Sea. We see joint training exercises with the Thai military; soldiers in repose in Haiti; military veterinarians tending to a goat in Panama; the commanding officer of a rescue and salvage ship exchanging flowers with Vietnamese military officers.</p>
<p class="p3">In L&ecirc;’s beautiful portraits, officers and other personnel appear placid, stoic, almost bored—another day at the office, keeping watch on a multi-billion-dollar aircraft carrier as it ambles through the Arabian Gulf.</p>
<p class="p3">That figure of $526.6 billion is staggering, but as a country we mostly accept it as the necessary status quo. L&ecirc;’s photographs reflect this sense of normalcy. But in doing so they also ask whether our place in the world should require a ubiquitous U.S. military, and they urge us to contemplate more deeply the amount of money and effort that go into making sure the “sharp end of the spear” hits home when we need it to. <br />

<p class="p3"><strong>Does Yellow Run Forever? <img alt="" style="float: right;" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/MACK_Paul-Graham1_Abstract.jpg" /><br />

<p class="p3">Photographs of rainbows, of one’s girlfriend sleeping, and of pawn shops that buy jewelry from those who either need to sell or no longer want their baubles—these are well-known (and some might say clich&eacute;), entries in the photographic lexicon. Certainly these images can be beautiful and magical; tender and erotic; and poignant symbols of financial struggle, respectively, but original? Not in most hands.</p>
<p class="p3">In his latest book, <em>Does Yellow Run Forever?</em>, Paul Graham employs these familiar photographic tropes to surprising effect, mixing them together into a sequence that leads readers to contemplate beauty and wonder, love, hope, doubt, lust, greed, photographic symbolism and other themes.</p>
<p class="p3">In the small yellow-covered book, which has shimmering endpapers and gold-edged pages, glossy photographs of rainbows made in the majestic green hills and valleys of Western Ireland alternate with peaceful images of a woman sleeping in different beds. We ask: Has Graham gone soft? Previous works like <em>a shimmer of possibility</em>, which earned him a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art and the 2009 Deutsche B&ouml;rse Prize, considered issues of class, race and economics both in the United States and England, where he is from. Yet when he introduces the New York City gold stores to this series, the places where onetime symbols of love and prosperity all too often end up, the book takes a new turn. Then the rainbows and the sleeping woman are reintroduced and the cycle is repeated.</p>
<p class="p3">It may be that we’re seeing some of Graham’s most personal work to date. Whether or not he’s wondering about the (im)permanence and artifice of love—or photographs—doesn’t preclude us from doing so ourselves. Nor does it matter as we appreciate Graham’s ability to make compelling sequences from beautiful but conceptually unremarkable images. <br />

<p class="p3"><strong>Afghanistan <img alt="" style="float: right;" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/APETURE_Afghanistan_larry-towell-cover-Render_Abstract.jpg" /><br />
By Larry Towell <br />
</strong>Aperture<br />
192 pages, 350 images <br />

<p class="p3">Photojournalist Larry Towell traveled to Afghanistan in 2008 and 2011, and in the course of his tours was embedded with U.S. and British troops, visited a hospital for landmine victims, photographed ordinary citizens, and for a time traveled with the Taliban. His new book is a deeply personal reflection on his experiences in the country. The book is a reproduction of a maquette he made, with photos stuck onto the pages and handwritten notes around them, as well as collages of multiple images overlapping. A long essay by Towell appears in a smaller booklet that is pasted within the photo book; it tells the stories behind many of the series he includes in the book, and expresses his impression of what he calls “the shell-shocked people of this disfigured land,” their leaders and their occupiers.</p>
<p class="p3">Many of the pages are crowded with images that show subtle variations of a scene or subject. He includes typologies: a series of Russian army helmets, another on prosthetics made for landmine victims, another on weapons. These catalogues of objects are a reminder of Afghanistan’s recent history of conflict, dating back to the Soviet invasion of the 1980s. But one of the earliest photos in the book shows an ash- and debris-covered street in lower Manhattan on September 11, 2001, and the main concerns of the book and of his essay are the consequences of the invasion by the U.S. and Western allies. </p>
<p class="p3">In his essay he writes with affection about soldiers he spent time with, but he describes the beginnings of the war on terror as opening a Pandora’s box that, in Afghanistan, he says, became a war on a society. “The critical question, to me, remains: how many private military contractors, drone navigators, CIA agents, and other intelligence operatives will be left behind to continue an endless war based out of Afghanistan? This was never one in which the U.S. could declare victory and walk away.” </p>
<p class="p3">Towell, who also photographed the war waged by the U.S.-backed Contras in Nicaragua in the 1980s, takes a long view when it comes to the consequences of violence. He presents a multitude of photos of people and places wounded and battle scarred, and notes, “the Afghans will settle their scores.”<br />

By Michael von Hassel <br />
</strong>teNeues<br />
208 pages, 125 color images <br />

<p class="p5"> </p>
<p class="p5"> </p>
<p class="p3">German photographer Michael von Hassel’s <em>Compendium </em>is an exuberant, colorful, and hyper-real romp across a wide swath of subjects: forests, malls, cityscapes, Oktoberfest tents, fashion show venues, Monument Valley. You can practically hear Von Hassel saying, “Look! This is so cool!” and there you are, high in the Alps under surreal skies, or on a cobble-stoned, neon-smeared street in Istanbul, or perhaps a parking garage aglow with mercury vapor lights. </p>
<p class="p3">He’s drawn to brilliant color, repeating patterns and texture, and everything real becomes a little (or a lot) out of this world. Von Hassel sometimes achieves that with collage and double-exposure techniques, and more often with a lot of post-processing, which can be a dangerous thing. Photographers often rely on digital filters to run interference for bad pictures. Or they just don’t know when to say when, filtering to the point of crassness. Von Hassel skates along the edge of thin ice, but manages (usually) not to fall through. His colors are garish. He cranks the contrast way up. But it has the effect of heightening the experience, like a psychotropic drug. </p>
<p class="p3">There are some clunkers, however. The opening series of collages built around words such as Peace, Power and Love, seems trite. And the book includes a few too many fawning essays by experts and non-experts alike who over-analyze and oversell the importance of the work. <em>Compendium </em>is about the surface of things. It’s not particularly challenging, but von Hassel’s style is distinctive, and his work is fun to look at. <br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[ Test shoots are a time-honored strategy for honing new skills and building portfolios. But photographers talk less about shooting on spec—i.e., shooting a test for a particular client for free, with the hope of landing an assignment. Many photographers frown upon it, fearing that if they shoot on spec, clients may start to expect it, forcing photographers to work even harder (and spend out of pocket) to land jobs.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But shooting on spec is a strategy that can work if it’s for a client you trust, and if you’re shooting for your portfolio, too. Photographers <a href="http://aarongreene.com/portfolios/">Aaron Greene</a>, <a href="http://afarnum.com/">Alex Farnum</a> and Chris Stanford all landed assignments from the spec work made for clients they were pursuing. In all three cases, the photographers had pre-existing relationships with the clients or their ad agencies. Those relationships gave them access to the people, information and brand strategies they needed to plan their spec shoots, and get their work in front of the critical decision makers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here is what they told us.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>Chris Stanford for Ashworth Golf Apparel</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div>It was creative director Kevin Buth of Zambezi in Los Angeles who suggested <a href="http://www.chrisstanford.com/">Chris Stanford</a> do a test shoot for <a href="http://ashworthgolf.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-TMaG-Site/default/Default-Start?utm_source=google&amp;utm_account=ashworthgolf&amp;utm_campaign=Trademark-B-Exact-Desktop&amp;utm_adgroup=Trademark-X-X-General&amp;utm_keyword=Ashworth&amp;utm_content=43443330606&amp;utm_type=e&amp;utm_device=c">Ashworth</a>, the golf apparel brand owned by Adidas. Stanford was reluctant. “I was worried they’d get me for an editorial price, and use the images for advertising,” he says. But he trusted Buth, and it paid off—with work not only for Ashworth, but other clients, too.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It all started with a fashion spread Stanford shot for <em>Golf Digest</em> in early 2012. Buth saw it and called Stanford, explaining that he wanted to pitch a campaign idea to Ashworth, inspired by the <em>Golf Digest </em>spread.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Buth’s idea was to shoot a print campaign featuring four golf pros traveling around California, playing different courses. He wanted the campaign to emphasize the friendship, camaraderie and adventure, not the mechanics of golf. “We wanted to go back to the spirit of the game,” he says. “A lot of times, to prove a vision or piece of creative you can’t just source inspiration or reference, you have to go make it,” Buth told <em>PDN</em> via email. He approached Ashworth with the idea, and showed them some of Stanford’s work. “[They] said ‘Let’s go make it happen.’”</div>
<div>The plan for the test was to take a one-day road trip to the Sandpiper Golf Club in Santa Barbara with four non-professional golfers, including Zambezi and Ashworth employees. Stanford, who has a background in photojournalism, documented the trip.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“I shoot a lot, and I shoot quickly,” he says. He shot the players on the course, having a meal and drinking beers on the beach. “It was a freewheeling shoot, doing whatever we wanted to do.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Afterwards, Stanford submitted his take to Buth, who edited the work. “It helps he has years of golf experience so there are lots of gems. In the golf category you can’t fake that. Any faux moments or bad players are exposed by the smallest flaw,” Buth says.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Ashworth “loved” the test images, Stanford says, and signed off on a campaign. The brief was to re-shoot the test, but with six pro players at the Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades. The key players were veteran Fred Couples and rising star Justin Rose. “It was a little bit [about] passing the torch,” Stanford says of the shoot. Buth adds that the goal was to “capture people and the Ashworth brand in uncontrived, casual, natural moments.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The shoot took place in November 2013. Stanford says the golfers hit the course and started sharing stories. His only instruction to them was “keep telling stories and just play.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It was a lot more complicated than the test shoot, however. Stanford estimates there were 100 or more people on set, including the golfers’ entourages, stylists, groomers, producers, agency creatives, client representatives, and a video crew “shooting b-roll over my shoulder,” Stanford says. “Kevin said to me, ‘Just do Sandpiper again and I’ll keep everyone out of your way.’”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Ashworth ended up using the images in a print campaign and in a TV spot. <a href="http://ammirati.com/">Ammirati USA</a> saw the spot on the Golf Channel, and hired Stanford to direct two TV ads for the PGA.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Meanwhile, Buth and Stanford did a second test shoot for Ashworth last April. It was similar in many ways to the first test, and once again, Ashworth bought the idea and signed off on another campaign. The shoot was scheduled to take place in October.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Stanford says his success with the Ashworth test shoots has made him less reluctant to shoot on spec, at least under certain conditions. “If it were a project that we could really fall in love with and make some interesting art, and it could possibly lead to a bigger campaign, well, then I’m totally in.”</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div><a href="http://www.monakuhn.com/">Mona Kuhn</a> likes to distinguish between the words “naked” and “nude,” emphasizing that nakedness implies being “vulnerable” or “caught off guard.” Known for her thought-provoking and sensual—but decidedly un- erotic—nude photographs, Kuhn uses friends and family as models, thereby creating a level of comfort and trust that she feels is intrinsic to her work.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The German-Brazilian photographer’s <a href="https://steidl.de/Books/Private-1638444852.html?SID=FvVgtZsdfa34">new monograph,</a> <em><a href="https://steidl.de/Books/Private-1638444852.html?SID=FvVgtZsdfa34">Private</a></em><a href="https://steidl.de/Books/Private-1638444852.html?SID=FvVgtZsdfa34">,</a> set in the harsh landscape of the American Southwest, was inspired by her curiosity about the vast deserts surrounding her adopted home of Los Angeles, where she is an independent scholar at The Getty Research Institute.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“I was guided by these sand colorations... and then the similarities that has to skin coloration,” Kuhn explains. Beginning in 2011 and over the course of the next two-and-a-half years, she took numerous trips into the Mojave desert, crossing into Arizona and even spending some time on a Navajo Indian reservation. Kuhn stayed with friends and subjects, but also camped in the desert, putting her film in a cooler to protect it from the heat.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Kuhn went into the wilderness with ideas about abstracting the human form, in all its vulnerability, against the implacable harshness of this land, and letting her senses guide her from there.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Dun colored slopes of sand dunes, barren save for an occasional patch of scrubgrass. The pale swell of a woman’s breasts, thumb hooked in her brassiere, a tattoo of a black widow spider adorning the same hand. The wrinkled white sheets of an unmade bed approximate an image, on the opposite page, of shifting desert sands that sit in the shadow of a promontory. The mirage of a naked woman seen through a window as she turns away, the reflection of a palm tree superimposed over her and sunlight refracted through it all. A “sand waterfall” spilling over the terraced edges of worn cliffs, a tan-colored veil plunging to the canyon floor. These are some of the images we see in <em>Private</em>.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Kuhn, fascinated by art at a young age, was initially drawn to photography by the medium’s immediacy. She guesses she has been shooting nudes since the early 1990s. Realizing that clothing dated her photographs, Kuhn “started simplifying things,” she says. “The nudes came as a way of going back to a more basic humanity and becoming a little more intemporal.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Kuhn’s process is highly intuitive, focused on putting herself in a position to best react to what she encounters without overthinking things. For her, the mysterious intersection of chance and unconscious desire is where photography is most vital. “There is no formula [for what I do]. I think it’s what attracts you to something, together with your instincts, and that is something that nobody can teach you,” she elaborates. “You play, you look, you see, you adapt. It’s better to embrace the element of surprise than to try and control it too much.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Kuhn made the photographs in <em>Private</em> entirely on film with a Hasselblad, in part because of the unavailability of electricity while she was traversing the desert alone or with her subjects. To edit the work she would mount “little prints on a huge wall” in her workspace and look them over daily, taking out anything that started to bore her, lacked a certain depth or simply didn’t fit the evolving narrative. Through this sort of attrition she whittled two years’ worth of photographs down to the most compelling and cohesive set of images. “It’s a slow process, six to eight months, but that [process] is when the work will tell the artist what it wants to be,” Kuhn says.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Kuhn’s projects are slow-moving, and she often is working on more than one at a time. Something new is always bound to snag her imagination, and her related series, <a href="http://www.monakuhn.com/collections/view/acido-dorado/">“Acido Dorado,”</a> is a perfect example. Kuhn began “Acido Dorado,” which was exhibited recently at Edwynn Houk Gallery in New York, in the fall of 2013, while she was working on finishing Private. Jacintha, a longtime friend and frequent model for Kuhn’s work was visiting the U.S., and the two women traveled to Acido Dorado, a house in the desert town of Joshua Tree. Handmade by renowned California architect Robert Stone, Acido Dorado is a home of gold and mirrors, a futuristic birdcage nestled high in the desert. Captivated by the structure’s exuberant combination of minimalism and decadence, rich with colors drawn straight from Kuhn’s palette, she reached out to the architect and secured access to the location.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>For Kuhn, the ability to be inside or outside of the glass house and remain intimately connected with the surrounding landscape, through reflections on windows and metallic surfaces, was transformative. Jacintha is the only model, but the house and desert surroundings take on roles in the narrative, merging and diverging, in keeping with the mirage-like atmosphere. Kuhn works without assistants, but in many ways “Acido Dorado” became a quasi-collaboration. She and Jacintha would shoot in the mornings and evenings to take advantage of the quality of the light, then examine the results together (Kuhn made the images with a digital Hasselblad) and exchange ideas about what direction to take the next day. “It’s something I hadn’t done in my work before and don’t necessarily plan to do in the future,” Kuhn says. “It had to do with a specific moment in time with a specific person...my own maturity as an artist and the maturity of our relationship.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Although Kuhn and Jacintha did a preliminary edit of “Acido Dorado” together while they were in Joshua Tree, that project ended up on Kuhn’s “wall” as well. It was then, when she could look at all the prints together, that Kuhn began to really see how the images interacted with one another, how her efforts to abstract the human form had, in the mirrors and glass of Stone’s trippy oasis, become something “illusory” and “disorienting.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><em>Private</em> and “Acido Dorado” are clearly connected in their inspirations, but work on very different wavelengths. The hazy intimacy of “Acido Dorado” seems to almost stand in contrast to the stark vision of <em>Private</em>, where we move between the sunswept silence of the desert and the still coolness of the indoors, wedges of light streaming through the corners and gaps of heavy curtains and drawn blinds. Kuhn is currently working towards editing “Acido Dorado” into book form but demurs when asked for a likely publication date. “It’s always a process...that’s what’s fascinating, I never know when it will start or end, but thank goodness it does,” she laughs.</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[ For <a href="http://www.jasonelias.com/">Jason Elias</a>, a week-long assignment to shoot promotions for <a href="http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/moonshiners/about-this-show/moonshiners-about-show/">“Moonshiners,” the Discovery Channel reality show</a>, was the big break he’d been waiting for, and he was feeling rattled. Lara Richardson, senior VP of broadcast promotions, came on set for the last day of shooting, and just looked on in silence. “I would [shoot] stuff and say, Lara, are you good? And she would say, ‘If you think you’ve got it, move on.’”
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Elias decided to trust his instincts and just keep moving. After the wrap, he asked Richardson why she’d been so quiet. “And she said, ‘I wanted to see how you reacted. I wanted to see how you ran the set.’” She wanted to see if he could draw out their personalities rather than simply direct them “to stand there with their arms crossed, looking mean,” he explains.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Elias aced the test, and went on to shoot numerous promotions for Moonshiners, Deadliest Catch, Amish Mafia, Fast N’ Loud, and other Discovery Channel shows. That led to assignments for Country Music Television, the History Channel, TLC and other clients. “I found this incredible niche that gets me a lot of work,” Elias says.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But he struggled to get his career off the ground. He endured a decade of false starts and bad luck before his film industry experience, some entrepreneurial talent, and a lot of soul searching paid off.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In fact, success came after he quit trying so hard. “I decided to stop striving for a while,’” he says. “One of the things that I have learned is, if I’m constantly assessing and strategizing...That’s when I start really doubting myself. If I trust myself, what’s the worst that can happen? I go back to being a gaffer, and I have a great career and a good life.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Elias attended film school, and during the ‘90s worked his way up to head gaffer on commercial sets for Fortune 500 brands, such as GM. He also worked on feature films. One day, he bought a still camera from a unit photographer on a film set, and shortly afterwards took a vacation to Hong Kong.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“Back from the trip, the response to photos I took randomly was tremendous,” he says. “I discovered my passion: walking around with a still camera.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Elias had no idea how to become a photographer, other than to find work as an assistant. But it would have meant a steep cut in pay that he didn’t think he could afford. And in the film business, he says, “There’s a sense of, ‘We’re doing the real work, and the stills guys mimic what we do.’”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then a friend, who was head traffic manager at House of Blues, offered him a job shooting images for a menu. He went to Samy’s camera in Los Angeles and said he had no idea what film to use. A guy at the film counter spent an hour talking Elias through the job, and then asked, “How did you get this job?”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Elias ended up “shooting everything” for House of Blues for the next two years. “What I learned from the film business was, if you don’t know something, hire someone who does. So I had awesome lighting people, awesome grips, camera assistants, makeup and wardrobe people,” he says, noting that he at least learned as a head gaffer how to manage people and a budget. “I had the confidence to surround myself with people who knew more than me. I wasn’t afraid to do that, and that’s what saved me on this job.” </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He made good money, but it was his only client. And with no idea how to market himself, he wasn’t able to build his base. Eventually, his House of Blues contact moved on. The photo assignment work fizzled out. Elias went back to gaffing in 2009, but decided also to try his hand at making a documentary film.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“I interviewed old time crew members who had worked on the films of the golden age of Hollywood,” he says. The project took nearly three years to complete, and Elias was on the verge of signing a distribution deal. “It fell apart at the last minute,” he says. “At the same time, I went through a pretty bad divorce. Nothing seemed to be working.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>That was his turning point, he says. He took up Buddhism and started meditating. It was then he decided to stop striving, and just try to be the best gaffer he could be. Not long afterwards, he met Richardson while doing broadcast production work for Discovery. “We just became friends,” Elias says. “There was no sense of me ever wanting anything from her. In a certain sense, that helped me.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Through their casual conversation, Richardson found out Elias was a travel photographer “but we never talked about me shooting for her.” That changed when a photographer Richardson had booked for a Moonshiners promotion bailed out at the last minute for a <em>National Geographic </em>assignment. Richardson called Elias, and offered him the job.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“Here was my opportunity,” he says. “I was completely terrified.” </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After passing Richardson’s test on that shoot, Elias was shooting assignments for her all the time. [Richardson was unavailable for comment before our deadline.] He also started researching how photographers self-promote, and realized he had to do two things: define his strength, and use it to target specific clients.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“I had a real passion for travel photography: flying to weird places, meeting local people who lived a lifestyle that I didn’t understand, and using my camera to understand and engage with it. That’s portrait work,” Elias says.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He started listing clients he thought would want him to engage with people “to explore what their product is: people working in their plants, scientists formulating stuff, or reality show stars who make moonshine or catch crabs,” he says. Elias started sending emails every six weeks announcing different campaigns he’d shot, followed by postcards to those who clicked through his e-mail links to his website.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He was strategic about what he sent, and to whom. With a promo featuring an image he’d shot for Deadliest Catch, for instance, he’d send emails to broadcasters, and clients in the adventure travel business. “I would have in my mind exactly what kind of client I would go after, and it really started to pay dividends. I started getting those [clients].” (He landed a job for Country Music Television that is likely to lead to more CMT work, he says).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Most of Elias’s work so far has been for broadcast networks. He’s now pushing to land corporate assignment work. He’s also doing cinematography for the Disney Channel and ABC. And he’s shot commercials for Google, BET, Nickelodeon, A&amp;E and MTV.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Elias says the secret to his success was simply figuring out what he was passionate about, but it doesn’t require all the suffering he went through to figure it out, he adds. “You can think to yourself, what’s hot right now? How do I chase the market? [But] you’ll never be tapping into what it is that you actually want to express.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“I think the way you end up trusting yourself is pretty simple. If you shoot something that you think people would want to see, and then shoot something that you want to see, watch what the [difference in] reaction is...if you actually focus on what comes from within you, you will have clients that will work with you forever.”</div>]]></article_text>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>Test shoots are a time-honored strategy for honing new skills and building portfolios. But photographers talk less about shooting on spec—i.e., shooting a test for a particular client for free, with the hope of landing an assignment. Many photographers frown upon it, fearing that if they shoot on spec, clients may start to expect it, forcing photographers to work even harder (and spend out of pocket) to land jobs.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>But shooting on spec is a strategy that can work if it’s for a client you trust, and if you’re shooting for your portfolio, too. Photographers Aaron Greene, Alex Farnum and Chris Stanford all landed assignments from the spec work made for clients they were pursuing. In all three cases, the photographers had pre-existing relationships with the clients or their ad agencies. Those relationships gave them access to the people, information and brand strategies they needed to plan their spec shoots, and get their work in front of the critical decision makers.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Here is what they told us.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Alex Farnum for Reebok</strong></div>
<div><strong><br /></strong></div>
<div>Advertising photographer <a href="http://afarnum.com/">Alex Farnum</a> does test shoots to build his portfolio, but he had never shot on spec to land a particular client. That changed earlier this year when he shot on spec to land jobs from Reebok. It worked: Farnum shot his first Reebok assignment in August, and a second in October.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The key to that success, he says, was the strength of his relationships with everyone involved, from his rental house, to his crew, to Cris Logan, the design director at <a href="http://www.venablesbell.com/latest">Venables Bell &amp; Partners</a>, Reebok’s ad agency.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Farnum makes a list every year of the 20 or so brands he’d like to shoot for. This year, Reebok was on his list, and he discovered the account had recently moved from DDB to Venables Bell &amp; Partners.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>“I had worked with them on Intel and eBay, and had a great relationship with them already,” Farnum says. “I called Cris and said, ‘You should give all the work to me!’” Logan said he thought Farnum’s style suited the brand, according to the photographer. “But he said, ‘I don’t see much sports on your website.’” </div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Logan explained in an email that Farnum’s work at the time was “pretty people in pretty places, doing aspirational things. Alex probably felt he needed to show us he was capable of the rawness and grit we need Reebok photography to represent.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Farnum asked Logan if he’d be interested in seeing a test shoot. “He said, ‘That would be awesome.’” So Farnum pulled together  his “go-to team”: the producer, hair stylist, makeup artist, and wardrobe and prop stylists that he frequently works with. All agreed to do the test for free. Farnum also got rental equipment at no cost from a rental house he works with regularly.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>“I explained I had the opportunity to shoot this test, and if Venables liked it, I might win Reebok work,” Farnum says. The understanding was that if he won a job, he’d hire everyone who helped with the test. “We all [believe] you need to spend money to make money.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The idea was to photograph athletes decked out in Reebok clothing and shoes, going through the paces at a CrossFit studio. Logan had shown him comps of a Reebok campaign that was already in the works. “I saw it was in-line with my style,” Furnam says. “For me, it was a challenge because I hadn’t shot a ton of sports.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Farnum shot both stills and video of the model performing a variety of training exercises. (His producer scouted a studio, which the owner let Farnum use in exchange for images.)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>“The images were spontaneous and beautiful. I liked what he did so much, I ended up using some of his test images in comps,” Logan says. He adds that he’d never seen a photographer go to such lengths to win work. “It really showed us his fire, his intensity and his commitment to expanding and improving his craft. Alex busted his ass to prove to us—and maybe himself—that he was the right choice.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>By August, Farnum had his first assignment to shoot a set of Reebok ads for retail display. The brief called for photographs of a woman in action in a dance studio, shot in a gritty, reportage style.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>After he completed that assignment, Reebok booked him for another “much bigger” assignment. Like the first assignment, it called for shooting models engaged in sports-related activities.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Farnum says he approaches all of his test shoots with three questions in mind: Will it be a challenge? Is it a good creative outlet? Will someone be interested in the work?</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>“Obviously I think about what kind of work it will win me,” he says. “The best route is to go out, do the test, then use the work as a way to get through the door.”</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>Given the dangers facing journalists who try to travel in northern Iraq and Syria to cover the fight against ISIS (the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria), it’s a challenge to find stories that aren’t already being told. So when <a href="http://www.erintrieb.com/">Erin Trieb</a>—a veteran freelancer who has been embedded with U.S. forces in Afghanistan—was offered a chance to shoot a typically closed-off all-female unit of Kurdish volunteer soldiers in Syria, “I jumped at the chance,” she tells <em>PDN</em> via email. “When you are asked that question, as a photographer, you don’t say no.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The Austin, Texas-based Trieb had been working in Kurdistan for two months, and was hoping to embed with the Kurdish Peshmerga fighters when she got the offer from a general to embed with the Kurdish Women’s Protection Unit (YPJ). </div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>While it wasn’t a difficult decision for Trieb, any sort of travel in northern Iraq can be perilous for westerners, and recent executions by ISIS have only heightened tensions. To get to the YPJ, Trieb had to secure rides for a 12-hour journey over the Kurdistan-Syria border, talking her way through checkpoints along the road.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>“During one border crossing, I had to get in and out of four different vehicles, each one driving me closer to the border but not driving more than a mile,” Trieb recalls. “There is some contention between certain military and political factions, so a particular group wearing a particular uniform had to escort me.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>But the women she met—and the images she made—proved worth the trouble. Some 7,000 women make up the ranks of the YPJ, which grew out of the Kurdish resistance movement. The U.S. provides support to moderate rebel groups fighting ISIS and Bashar al-Assad’s regime, such as Harakat Hazm, but the U.S. won’t supply the YPJ, because it has been associated with Turkey’s Kurdistan Worker’s Party (PKK), which has been labeled a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Trieb hoped to provide a glimpse into the reality for many refugees in the area. She found the women and their families to be honest, kind and charitable. Most who fight are between 18 and 24 years old, but some as young as 12 help with cooking and other chores. The women receive supplies and food from the locals that they protect.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The unit trains constantly. New recruits begin their days at 4 a.m., drilling, taking lessons in classrooms and getting six hours of sleep per night. Many of them had never even played sports or engaged in any physical activity before joining the YPJ. Most are unmarried and have dedicated themselves to the struggle.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Trieb says that since the project came to her unexpectedly, she didn’t have time to do any research or map out a plan for the story. “But I did ask a ton of questions while shooting, did many interviews and gained a solid understanding of the story early on,” she says.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>She spent six days with members of the unit, capturing the mundane details of daily life as well as the harsh realities of soldiering. She started her days early. “I especially loved making images in the early morning, when their environment was quiet and still and there was beautiful soft, glowing light,” she says. All of the women lived together at several military bases, not unlike dormitories. In one room, the soldiers would be watching TV, in the next room they would be cooking lunch, and in the next they would be repairing their weapons.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Trieb had no trouble gaining the women’s trust. Her main obstacle was the YPJ leadership, which repeatedly denied her requests to photograph the women fighting on the front lines. “They said ‘You are our American guest, we can never let anything happen to you, we don’t want that on our hands. What will Obama say if you get injured?’”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Trieb says she edited images “every few days or so,” and even sent some work to a close colleague, photographer Katie Orlinsky, who gave her feedback about what the story was missing and what she needed to look for. After returning to a military base in Erbil, Iraq (from which she’s covered Kurdistan in recent months), she pitched the story to NBC News.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>“It immediately caught our attention,” says NBC News photography director James Collins. “It was a unique angle to this story. It was confidently shot—nice, intimate moments. It gave you a feel of the hard work that these women were doing to prepare themselves for battle, but also seeing the camaraderie. You can tell that these are women who were fighting for their own land.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>“We know her as a visually creative person but also as a solid journalist,” Collins adds. “That’s a very important combination. [Sometimes] photographers can have a good esthetic sense about their images, but the journalism is not so solid, in terms of telling the story.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Trieb says she hopes to return to do more work about the YPJ. She’d like to photograph more women at home with their parents, the few YPJ soldiers who are married, and the new Yazidi refugee recruits who are now enlisted. She would also like access to the frontlines to capture the women fighting in combat.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Having covered conflict for several years, Trieb says experiencing the excitement of something new and surprising like the YPJ helps remind her why she does what she does. “This project was a bit out of the blue,” she says. “I got that giddy buzz you get when you’re just starting out as a shooter, a thrill that makes your heart pound. I live for those moments.”</div>]]></article_text>

        <div>Photographer <a href="http://#http://www.crowleygraphs.com/Artist.asp?ArtistID=8684&amp;Akey=5WV96L8N">Stephen Crowley</a>, known for his distinctive, insightful, behind-the-scenes political coverage for <em>The New York Times</em>, explains how he works around the limits imposed on press photographers and what drives him to make his images informative.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: What fascinates you about covering politics?</strong></div>
        <div><strong>Stephen Crowley:</strong> It’s the sport of kings. You have teams, you have strong players and weak players and trades, and schemes. It’s always a story. And it’s a vocation you can do that actually benefits people. You don’t get rich doing this, but you live an incredibly rich life.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: You’re known for witty, quirky images. what’s your motivation?</strong></div>
        <div><strong>SC: </strong>Part of my motivation is I lost Class Wittiest by two votes to my brother in high school. But most of what I do is [provide] information. [My work is] there for the historical record. I like to impart important information that’s presented like a well- turned phrase.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: You use a lot of different cameras and formats. why do you change it up so much? </strong></div>
        <div><strong>SC: </strong>I’m not emotionally attached to any piece of equipment. Sometimes music is better with a cello and other times it’s more effective if you play it on a banjo.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: How do political photographers get along when they’re always shoulder-to-shoulder? And how do you get something different in such close quarters?</strong></div>
        <div><strong>SC:</strong> Everyone gets along really well. It’s just not an issue. Yeah, we compete. But I work differently than others.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: How so?</strong></div>
        <div><strong>SC:</strong> I think if I have any kind of gift, it’s humor. If I can take it right up to the edge of opinion, that’s great. But objectivity in what we do is essential. I avoid relationships with politicians. If you want to set the stage, and present your issue, I’ll go. If you want to close off a campaign or the Oval Office to the press, I’ve built a career working around that. If I can do it with a little bit of humor to draw attention: Good.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>On a campaign, you don’t need to be with the candidate. You need to watch who else is with the candidate. Who’s coming in the back door? Who’s slipping in the side of the hotel to meet them? Who’s the potential secretary of state walking in? That’s what you need to pay attention to: all the moving parts. They’re trying to get their message out, but I’m not their PR person. I’m just trying to grab little morsels of truth as I’m moving along through this story non-stop.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: People are cynical about politics right now. Is that a problem, and is there anything photographers can do about it? </strong></div>
        <div><strong>SC:</strong> People have always been cynical about politics. But with the collapse of news media, I think there are stories that aren’t being told. So it’s important to show people how their government works, and who they’re electing.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: But the press corps is now so walled-off from candidates and politicians, isn’t it? </strong></div>
        <div><strong>SC:</strong> I disagree with that. Am I inside the White House with [White House photographer] <a href="http://www.petesouza.com/">Pete Souza</a>? Absolutely not. But you can get a sense of what’s going on. It’s a matter of journalists committing themselves to find out. Our job is to keep poking at it, to walk up and down the streets and see who’s having lunch with whom, and piece it all together.</div>
        <div><em><br />
        </em></div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: You don’t feel your access is overly restricted? News organizations, including your employer, complained last spring about photographers’ lack of access to the president’s official meetings, and about being given white House handout photos instead. [See http://bit.ly/10mvdsu]</strong></div>
        <div><strong>SC:</strong> I’m OK with the White House making their decisions. It’s not my place to tell them they’re wrong. The real problem is when networks, and magazines, and newspapers, and websites all started using those handouts. You’re putting seasoned pros out of work. You’re calling me because I’m one of the last ones standing. Where’s Callie Shell? Chris Morris? Chris Usher? They’re gone [not shooting Washington politics anymore]. The news organizations choose to use the handouts. That’s what’s wrong. [Note: Crowley says <em>The New York Times</em> rarely publishes handout photos.]</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: What can photographers do about it?</strong></div>
        <div><strong>SC:</strong> [Make] bean counters aware that it doesn’t take much to derail an individual or organization’s credibility. It’s really that simple. There’s the value in supporting staff and professionalism.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: When does the 2016 presidential campaign heat up? </strong></div>
        <div>SC: It has started. As soon as the mid-term [elections] are over, things will really kick in.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: How old are you? </strong></div>
        <div><strong>SC:</strong> I’m 61.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: Campaigns require a lot of stamina. Is it getting more difficult for you?</strong></div>
        <div><strong>SC: </strong>Of course. [But] the campaigns are not making as many stops as they used to. They’re using social media [so] they can do one event in a city instead of making a number of VFW calls. That’s bad for democracy. You just see a packaged news report on [local TV], and it’s less interaction with the people.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>But the White House trips? They’re manageable. I don’t go out drinking at night. I have a disciplined approach I learned from Larry Downing at Reuters. As long as you discipline yourself—when I was younger, on some of these campaigns, it was party all the time.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: Who were your mentors?</strong></div>
        <div><strong>SC: </strong>I didn’t really have mentors, but there were people I admired. Wally McNamee. David Burnett for his humor. Chris Usher for his work ethic. Larry Downing has a discipline. Scott Applewhite. Grey Villet from LIFE magazine. You learn a little something from everybody.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: With your “smoke-Filled Rooms” project, you were delving into the politics of various issues. What projects are you working on now?</strong></div>
        <div><strong>SC: </strong>We have this new project called “First Draft.” It’s eating up pictures like crazy. <a href="http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/category/smoke-filled-rooms/?_r=0">Lens [<em>The New York Times</em> photo blog] was great with the “Smoke-Filled Rooms” project.</a> They gave me an opportunity to package [stories] in a creative way, and the approach made my coverage better than it had been. The other thing is, in the end I wanted to have a book. I never said I was going to be Henri Cartier-Bresson. But if I can find an interesting way to present [my images], then OK. If I do a quad- or triptych—take those things apart and they’re not great pictures, but put them together in a creative way and suddenly it means something. And if every once in a while I do make the decisive moment, that’s great, too.</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>Test shoots are a time-honored strategy for honing new skills and building portfolios. But photographers talk less about shooting on spec—i.e., shooting a test for a particular client for free, with the hope of landing an assignment. Many photographers frown upon it, fearing that if they shoot on spec, clients may start to expect it, forcing photographers to work even harder (and spend out of pocket) to land jobs.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>But shooting on spec is a strategy that can work if it’s for a client you trust, and if you’re shooting for your portfolio, too. Photographers <a href="http://aarongreene.com/">Aaron Greene</a>, <a href="http://afarnum.com/">Alex Farnum</a> and <a href="http://www.chrisstanford.com/">Chris Stanford</a> all landed assignments from the spec work made for clients they were pursuing. In all three cases, the photographers had pre-existing relationships with the clients or their ad agencies. Those relationships gave them access to the people, information and brand strategies they needed to plan their spec shoots, and get their work in front of the critical decision makers.</div>
<div>Here is what they told us.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Aaron Greene for Confluence Outdoor</strong></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>For the past few years, photographer <a href="http://aarongreene.com/">Aaron Greene</a> has been shooting product shots for the various brands owned by <a href="http://www.confluenceoutdoor.com/">Confluence Outdoor</a>, a watersports equipment and apparel company. “I shoot boats and paddles. It’s studio work on white seamless,” he says. </div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>But he also wanted a chance to shoot some of the company’s lifestyle advertising work, too. He told that to Confluence senior designer, Chris Hessman, who looked at Greene’s portfolio, and told him it was missing the kind of outdoor adventure work Confluence needed.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>“My boss is used to working with seasoned [outdoor adventure] photographers. I can’t just tell her, ‘I think [Aaron’s] going to be able to do it.’ I had to be able to convince her,” Hessman says.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>“He said, ‘Why don’t you do a test shoot and show us what you envision,” Greene recalls.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Greene says he “went for it,” and did so without much planning. His idea was to take a couple of friends and some kayaks to a nearby lake and start shooting. He first approached a friend who had done some modeling in New York. She had a jewelry business, and Greene had done some photography for her. “She said, ‘Whenever you need something, let me know.’”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>While he was in her store, asking her to model for his shoot, another friend walked in. “He had a Jeep, kayaks, a tent, everything we needed,” and he was willing to model, too. Greene asked when he could do it. “He said, ‘Let’s do it tomorrow.’”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Greene was aware of his handicaps: His friend’s kayaks were gray and scratched up. He had few other props, no stylists, and no assistants. “I didn’t let that bog me down. I was just trying to see if I could create something that felt real.” </div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>He told his two models he wanted them to pretend to be a couple, on a weekend camping and kayaking getaway. “I described it scene by scene,” he says. “I would create the story and let them work with it a little bit.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The shoot lasted all day, and in addition to the kayaking, included a campfire scene after sunset. When Greene finished, he had more than 3,000 images, which he edited down to 55. “I’m sure it was still too many. I should have tried to [edit] to 30 images,” he says. He also shot 45 minutes of video, which he edited down to three minutes.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>He then met with Hessman to show the work. Greene says he didn’t just send links because he wanted to explain away some of the production shortcomings—such as the rough condition of the kayaks—in person.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>It took several months, but Greene’s effort finally paid off. The first lifestyle shoot he got was for <a href="http://www.bombergear.com/">Bomber Gear</a>, a kayaking apparel brand managed by Confluence. The brief called for eight images for use in unspecified print, Web, and catalogue advertising for two years. The second assignment was a shoot for <a href="http://www.perceptionkayaks.com/pages/index/homepage">Perception Sport</a>, Confluence’s entry-level kayak brand, which they were promoting with lifestyle advertising for the first time.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Looking back, Greene has mixed feelings about shooting on spec. “It was work I needed to do [to establish my career], and whether they hired me or not, I needed work for my portfolio,” he says of the spec shoot. But he also says, “I don’t want to be setting a precedent for clients to expect commercial photographers to always be willing to do a test to prove themselves for every single job.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Hessman, who now works for Walmart.com, says he didn’t encourage spec shoots while he was at Confluence. But photographers occasionally did test shoots with the company’s products, and it helped them get noticed—and sometimes led to assignments, he says.</div>]]></article_text>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>Since 2008, the duo <a href="http://reedandrader.com/">Reed + Rader (Pamela Reed and Matthew Rader)</a> have been bringing fashion images to life online, first for editorial clients like <em>POP</em> and <em>V</em> magazines, and then for commercial clients such as Victoria’s Secret and Thom Browne. Until recently, their medium of choice was the GIF: the format for sharing animated images that has been popular since before streaming online video was possible. “It’s a great way to show the clothes,” Reed says. “If you want to buy a dress, you can actually see how a dress flows. It’s not just still. When I walk down the street, I want to look awesome with that dress.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But while GIFs have become ubiquitous in mainstream media, the bitmap image format is limited: GIFs have no inherent compression, so to make a GIF easily shareable, it has to be small enough to load quickly on a Web browser. GIFs are also limited to 256 colors—one more reason why Reed + Rader are pushing the boundaries of the GIF, and gravitating towards shareable video.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>One recent video creation is <a href="http://www.vmagazine.com/site/content/2408/fashions-new-florals-in-motion">“Flowers,” a project for</a> <em><a href="http://www.vmagazine.com/site/content/2408/fashions-new-florals-in-motion">V</a></em> <a href="http://www.vmagazine.com/site/content/2408/fashions-new-florals-in-motion">magazine</a> that’s also indicative of their workflow. Reed produced and art-directed a shoot with a model on a green-screen, using ultra-high-definition video cameras (2.5K or 4K), moving around the model as she posed in different looks. The results of the shoot were 2D videos capturing the model rotating 360 degrees. Rader then built 3D environments on the computer using a videogame engine—the software that provides the backbone for maps, characters and objects within a 3D videogame world. Finally they imported each video of the model into the 3D environments so she appears to be standing in fantastic meadows, gardens or an unreal landscape. The final product is captured with what Rader calls a “virtual camera”: in post, Reed + Rader can choose any angle or camera movement they can dream up—even ones that would be difficult or impossible to create in real life.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“We’d been doing GIFs and video for a long time, and we made it a goal of ours to not just have static cameras anymore,” Rader says. “We wanted sweeping camera angles.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><em>V’s</em> online editor Natasha Stagg says Reed + Rader’s work helps illuminate the nuance of style and fashion trends. Before they began shooting “Flowers,” she talked to the pair about the floral prints and severe architectural shapes showing up in Spring/ Summer 2014 clothes. “I thought the way Reed + Rader captured those shapes by creating this sort of sci-fi world for them to live in was just very on point,” Stagg says.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Their process allows them to create dramatic and imaginative camera movements in post production, rather than being forced to capture them on set. “We get to control whatever the flyby camera angle is after the [shoot],” Reed says. The results can be a video, as it was in “Flowers,” or they can drop frames and colors to make a GIF, as in their recent job for Ray-Ban sunglasses. The client, Moving Image &amp; Content (MIC), matched Reed + Rader with <a href="http://audrey.buzznet.com/user/">Audrey Kitching</a>, a blogger, model and jewelry designer. The workflow for the project, <a href="http://www.reedandrader.com/rayban.html#content">“Ray-Ban Remix,”</a> was close to that of “Flowers,” with their video camera moving on a fixed track, but they composited each shot of Kitching into a single GIF. They made the CGI background with lots of pink and crystals, to match Kitching’s esthetic.</div>
<div>
<p>“Reed + Rader’s work is high fashion, yet still approachable,” says Quynh Mai, founder of MIC. “Their GIFs are high-quality and beautifully executed. There’s a sense of fantasy and magic within their work."</p>
<p>They have reached the enviable position of being treated as hands-on collaborators by their clients. “Clients aren’t going to come to us to shoot a girl against a white wall,” Reed says. Rader concurs: “When a client approaches us, they pretty much leave it up to us. They have a vague scope, but it’s, ‘Work some magic,’ which is awesome.”</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The pair, who met as students at Pittsburgh Art Institute, were not long out of graduate school at New York City’s School of Visual Arts when they decided they were done with making still images. Still images are static; the Internet is anything but. Why not take advantage of that? Even though they weren’t new, they could use GIFs to evolve “a new form of photography,” Rader says, that could leverage the Internet’s capability to do things that print can’t.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>They pitched their ideas to fashion magazines that were in obvious need of help on their websites. Most turned them down, but the younger, forward-thinking magazines could see the potential. Their first high-profile editorial for POP magazine was a hit, and other offers started pouring in. One early editorial client was <em>V</em>.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“I really think that of all the teams I’ve worked with for online- only content, they really understand that idea of transferring a fashion editorial to a Web audience better than maybe any,”says <em>V’s </em>Stagg. She adds, “They also come up with ideas that are completely different from the one before them each time, and that’s really exciting.”</div>
<div>Reed + Rader are itching to keep pushing into new territories. Just as they wanted to change the perception of GIFs as goofy cartoon bitmaps, they’re trying to do the same with 3D gaming environments.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“People think of gaming engines and their first instinct is ‘Oh, ‘Deathmatch,’ we’re going to shoot people,’” says Reed. “So we’ve been really hyped up about making GIFs not just goofy flames and skulls...[but] turning them into a legitimate photographic medium.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Rader says he hopes to take the virtual camera that they use in post-production rendering from passive to active, giving users control over their view of the 3D environments they create. The first step will be a follow up to a video called <a href="http://reedandrader.com/dubstepdinosaurs.html#content">Dubstep Dinosaurs</a>—which features dubstep dancers in cardboard costumes—which was part of their solo exhibition <a href="http://reedandrader.com/cretaceousreturnslenny.html#content">“Cretaceous Returns”</a> that was shown at New York’s School of Visual Arts and 18 Hewett Street in London. For the sequel, Dubstep Dinosaurs 3D, they will import the dancing dinos into a 3D world—built in programs like Maya, MotionBuilder, Cinema 4D and Unreal Engine—that the viewer can explore.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It may be some time before the Internet can become as interactive as Reed + Rader envisions it. But it wouldn’t be surprising if they’ve already mastered it by the time it does.</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>More than a decade ago, the longtime residents of Long Branch were embroiled in a battle to save their homes. Long Branch mayor Adam Schneider led local officials in the New Jersey seaside community in exploiting eminent domain—laws that allow governments to seize personal property for the public good in exchange for compensation—to seize old homes and buildings, and to redevelop the Long Branch waterfront with new condos and commercial structures. They claimed the plan would revitalize the area, which was once a resort destination, but had fallen on hard times. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/31/nyregion/testing-boundary-lines-eminent-domain-long-branch-wants-seize-old-homes-make.html">In a</a> <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/31/nyregion/testing-boundary-lines-eminent-domain-long-branch-wants-seize-old-homes-make.html">New York Times</a> </em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/31/nyregion/testing-boundary-lines-eminent-domain-long-branch-wants-seize-old-homes-make.html">article about the controversy</a>, a law school professor said, “This kind of open economic rape is outrageous.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Artist <a href="http://www.michaelashkin.com/">Michael Ashkin</a>, who works with photography, video and sculpture, stumbled into this scene unknowingly in 2002. He was driving down Ocean Boulevard in Long Branch on his way to visit his parents—he’d lived in the area when he was a child and stopped by often—and he noticed that “something seemed odd and wrong.” He parked his car and began to make photographs. “Everything seemed too quiet and desolate, and a surprising number of buildings seemed abandoned,” he told <em>PDN</em> via email.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>After researching the Long Branch controversy, Ashkin decided to pursue a photography project, returning “whenever he could” over the next five years to make pictures. His black-and-white photographs of the community are collected in <a href="http://www.a-jumpbooks.com/Ashkin_LongBranch.html">a new book</a>, recently published by A-Jump Books, which addresses Long Branch’s turmoil through a unique visual and narrative language that is visceral rather than literal.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Urban renewal— the sweep of cranes, the rumble of trucks and heavy machinery— is an essential part of the experience of people in many cities. Through photographs and daily experience, we know what the process of tearing down old structures and building new ones looks like. Ashkin felt “dead-on pictures of buildings and objects did not sufficiently capture the sense or truth of the space,” he says. “It was more about the larger space in which objects were coming into being and disappearing simultaneously.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Ashkin says he wanted his images to point to “that which is not really visible anyway, for instance, the larger forces acting on the landscape.” Photographing the “edges, moving the camera off-center,” proved a more effective and engaging visual strategy for Ashkin. “It’s hard to think about in-between spaces, because they are always to some extent invisible to us. When we name or recognize them, they become just another kind of object. So I had to find a way to fool myself into photographing something that I could only later recognize.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>In the foreground of one photograph sits a pile of scrapped materials; beyond a stand of trees we see a humble white home. The arm of a crane creeps in from the right of the frame at an obtuse angle. Another prescient image focuses closely on the house numbers spray-painted on the front columns of an old home in a way that recalls scenes of post-Katrina New Orleans. A short stone column anchors a white fence and dominates the foreground of an image; behind it rises a pile of dirt, and beyond that, the peaks of new rooftops jut into the sky.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>There are virtually no people in Ashkin’s photographs. “[The area] was very eerie, almost like it was haunted,” Ashkin recalls, with few people around. “I felt that the people who were missing or gone were just as important as the few I could see. And I felt that the people, the players in this drama, could somehow be embodied or sensed in the visible buildings, objects, cars and machines.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Some of the people Ashkin did encounter were police, and they generally weren’t pleased with him. Police stopped him repeatedly and ran background checks on him because he was pointing his camera away from the beach while on the boardwalk. The experience “cemented in my mind that this was an antagonistic situation,” he explains. “I was told that if I wanted to avoid future trouble I should only point my camera in directions that did not prompt suspicion.... My interactions with the police angered me and strengthened my resolve to continue the project,” he adds. “It is possible that this anger is legible in [the] photographs.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Ashkin moved to Ithaca, New York, in 2006 to take a teaching position at Cornell University. There he met Ron Jude and Danielle Mericle, the publishers of A-Jump Books, who expressed an interest in working on a project with him. When he showed them a box of Long Branch prints, they saw the series as a book.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Jude and Ashkin edited the images as if they were “a series of glances and juxtapositions,” Ashkin says. “We aimed to introduce certain crescendos, ironies, correspondences, etc., all within a more general chronological order.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The text in the book is a series of fragments pulled from the public statements of homeowners and politicians, news reports, real estate marketing and other sources. The fragments reflect a linguistic disconnect, and the reality that there “was no common language and no productive communication,” Ashkin explains. “I sensed that there was a parallel between the linguistic landscape and the physical landscape and I wanted to show this through juxtaposition and lack of a coherent social whole.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The Long Branch story, which predated the 2008 economic collapse fed by a risky real estate bubble, takes on a new significance now. “There’s a broader awareness and interest in the way the depredations of real estate are integral to the problems of global capitalism.” Ashkin suggests. “I’m hoping that what this book shows will be seen both as a local event and as part of a larger set of injustices.” </div>]]></article_text>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>Photojournalist <a href="http://damir.photoshelter.com/">Damir Sagolj</a> was in Fukushima, Japan, last fall, gathering stills, video and audio for a multimedia story when he asked himself the question: “What does the horror of a haunted place sound like?”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>His story, on the aftermath of the 2011 tsunami and the nuclear plant meltdown it triggered, focused on people forced to leave their homes due to radiation contamination. <a href="http://widerimage.reuters.com/story/nuclear-refugees">In “Broken Lives of Japan’s Nuclear Refugees,”</a> Sagolj tells the tale of one evacuee, Hiroshi Masukura, who has lived alone in an evacuation shelter since his wife died of an illness that he believes was exacerbated by the trauma of dislocation. Adding to the poignancy of the piece is the audio Sagolj recorded: crickets humming, waves washing onto the shore, the wind blowing through broken windows and Masukura singing a mournful song. Those sounds provide the score to a story about loneliness and loss.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>A photographer for Reuters based in Bangkok, Sagolj has been honored by World Press Photo and other awards for his news photos. But when he shoots videos, he’s not chasing events. “I don’t shoot action on video; TV does that,” he says. He places his camera on a tripod, and captures a few seconds of movement happening within his frame. At the same time, he’s listening. “Since there is no or little action in my clips, I pay more attention to sounds while recording.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>When he walks into a scene, he listens for subtle background sounds. Most of the audio for his Fukushima piece is made up of Masukura talking and singing, but Sagolj also wanted to add an additional layer of ambient sounds. The challenge, he says, was “to record the sound of emptiness, of loneliness.” The sound of crickets chirping seemed a perfect fit, he says, explaining, “Nature was taking over what humans left in a hurry.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Sagolj edits his videos himself, and says that cutting and mixing audio tracks taught him how to use audio to enrich a story. His earliest audio recordings seemed flat, he says, so he bought a more expensive recorder; it didn’t help. He asked for advice, but got only technical tips. Then one day he decided to revisit an old project, opening it in editing software. There, he could see his video and audio tracks side by side. “Visualization of tracks in editing software helped me to see [sound] and to start treating it the way I treat pictures—in layers,” he says, adding, “I loved it.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The Fukushima video opens with the sound of tolling bells, then text appears on screen to explain that the number of deaths among evacuees has exceeded the number killed in the original disaster. The bells fade, replaced by the sound of insects and chirping birds. Then we hear the sound of rain atop video of droplets running down a windowpane. The focus shifts, and through the window we see the coastline accompanied by the sound of waves breaking on the beach—visual and aural metaphors for the tsunami.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Sagolj says “Broken Lives” is the product of thorough research. “I do believe in a reporter’s instincts and his abilities to recognize important things in the field and react to them,” he says. “But I believe those are enhanced by serious research.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>He had covered and followed the disaster from the beginning and was honored in 2012 with a Pictures of the Year International prize in the multimedia category for a project on Fukushima. In the more recent news stories he read, he found brief references to the steadily rising death toll among evacuees–due to continuing medical issues, the shortage of hospitals, or suicide. His editors at Reuters supported his decision to bring the issue to the fore in his reporting from Fukushima last fall. With help from friends in Japan, Sagolj visited many sites and photographed many evacuees. (<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2013/10/the-broken-lives-of-fukushima/100603/">His photos from the trip were published in</a> <em><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2013/10/the-broken-lives-of-fukushima/100603/">The Atlantic</a></em> and other publications in March, on the tsunami’s third anniversary.) To make a compelling video narrative, he needed a strong protagonist. It took patience and a lot of legwork before he found Masukura. </div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Sagojl spent two days listening to his story. “He liked to have someone who would just sit face-to-face and listen,” the photographer recalls. He typically uses a small, unobtrusive Roland recorder with an onboard microphone, which he can place close to his subjects. In the audio Sagolj recorded, Masukura explains that he and his wife were ordered to leave their home with nothing but the clothes they were wearing. Once, he says, he and his wife laughed all the time, but in the small, prefabricated home to which they were moved after the disaster, they had little to talk about. She withdrew. One day they went to a doctor, he says, but “it was sort of too late.” Now alone in his home, he feels isolated from the strangers living around him in the evacuation center. “Who would ask me: ‘How are you, Mr. Masukura?’” he says. Except for Masukura’s voice, there was little other sound in his tiny house, Sagolj notes, “just an echo or a clock ticking.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>When Sagolj and his friends were about to leave, Masukura asked if they would like to hear a song he had written about his tragedy. Sagolj moved the recorder even closer. Sagojl doesn’t speak Japanese but, “I perfectly understood what he had to say.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Sagolj shot stills inside Masukura’s home. Outdoors, he shot both stills and video, focusing his camera on the distant horizon. His video clips were “moving pictures” that captured subtle movements: “flickering lights on an empty street, waves hitting rocks, a twisted clock swaying.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Sagolj had pre-conceived his edit for the story “before I even sat down at his computer,” he says. Masukura’s narration provided him with a “skeletal structure,” then he added imagery and sound for additional context. Rather than literally illustrating Masukura’s words, the visuals Sagolj chose symbolize the isolation and loss he describes: video clips show a traffic light blinking in front of an abandoned house and a capsized ship overgrown with grass that blows in the wind; still photos show a vending machine left in the middle of a field and a line of worn shoes in Masukura’s house. “I used pictures of windows every time the story leaves the house or comes back from outside,” Sagolj notes. “Psychologically, windows divide cold from warm, dark from bright, life from the absence of it.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>To decide how long to make his “moving images” and cuts between visuals, he tries to find a rhythm. Here, too, he says, his audio clips helped. Repetitive sounds like tolling bells or breaking waves worked “like a metronome that sets the speed” and set a pace for his edit.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>“The attention span of viewers is short, so I don’t have a lot of time to tell a story,” he says. Through his use of metaphor and his rich layering of text, audio, video and stills, Sagolj manages to communicate one man’s story—and a continuing problem facing his community—in less than five minutes.</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>Bob Dylan famously observed that you don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows. And there’s an unmistakable wind at the back of mirrorless camera systems. Models like <a href="http://www.panasonic.net/avc/lumix/dslm/gh4_special/">Panasonic’s Lumix GH4</a> and <a href="http://store.sony.com/alpha-a7/cat-27-catid-All-Alpha-a7-Cameras">Sony’s A7/A7R</a> have piqued the interest of both professional still photographers and videographers (and those who do both).</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Whether you’ve taken the plunge or still have your finger to the wind, we’ve collected some of the key glass across a spectrum of lens mounts to show you what mirrorless systems have to offer.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong><img alt="" style="float: left;" src="http://www.pdnonline.com/static/content_images/Leica-T-Lenses_23mm(1).jpg" />LEICA T-MOUNT</strong></div>
<div>Leica recently announced two T-mount lenses along with its new Leica T mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera: the Summicron-T 23mm f/2 ASPH and the Vario-Elmar-T 18–56mm f/3.5–5.6 ASPH lens. Of the two, we think the 23mm model is better suited to pro photographers, thanks to its 35mm full-frame-equivalent focal length and f/2–16 aperture range.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Designed with nine elements in six groups, the 23mm lens features two aspherical surfaces that help it deliver lovely bokeh. Autofocus is available but the lens also offers manual override in AF mode for fine-tuning your focus. The Summicron-T 23mm accepts 52mm filters. At 5.4 ounces and 2.5x1.5 inches, this little lens won’t take up much space in your camera bag. Judging from the price point, it will free up some space in your bank account, too.</div>
<div><br /></div>

<div><strong>FUJIFILM X-MOUNT<img alt="" style="float: right;" src="http://www.pdnonline.com/static/content_images/Fuji_Lens56mmBlackFront.jpg" /></strong></div>
<div>It was difficult to choose a favorite among Fuji’s XF/XC series lenses, but we think the Fujinon XF 56mm f/1.2R is ideal, with its 85mm-equivalent focal length and an f/1.2 low-light-conquering aperture. The lens features a metal aperture ring that clicks into place for accuracy, along with a focusing ring for photographers who prefer to forego autofocus (AF).</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Created for both esthetics and practicality, the lens’ seven- blade aperture delivers pleasingly round bokeh. Thanks to a new optical design, which features 11 elements in eight groups (including two extra-low dispersion elements, one double-sided aspherical element and four concave elements), this 56mm lens promises a reduction in chromatic aberration.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Faster AF is possible too, given an internal focusing system that moves only the smaller mid- and rear-elements. If you’re not shooting at a distance, set the lens to macro (with a focusing distance of 2.3–9.8 feet) for even speedier AF. The lens is compact at 2.88x2.74 inches, accepting 62mm filters. It weighs about 14.3 ounces.</div>
<div><br /></div>

<div><strong><img alt="" style="float: left;" src="http://www.pdnonline.com/static/content_images/Samsung-16-50mm-F2-2.8-S-ED-OIS-Lens-1.jpg" />SAMSUNG NX</strong></div>
<div>Announced at the same time as Samsung’s NX30 mirrorless camera, the 16–50mm f/2-2.8 S ED OIS is the first lens in the company’s new Premium S-series. With a full-frame- equivalent focal length of 24.6–77mm, it can capture an image from a wide angle, then quickly zoom into portrait mode. With a maximum aperture of f/2 at 16mm and f/2.8 at 50mm, this lens is fast, but can be stopped down to f/22 for shooting under bright sunlight.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The lens is splash- and dust-proof, too, so you can use it with confidence in rough weather. This optically stabilized lens features an updated Ultra-Precise Stepping Motor that Samsung claims focuses three times more precisely than the earlier model. Designed to minimize spherical and chromatic aberration, the lens is constructed of 18 elements in 12 groups with three aspherical lens, two extra low dispersion lenses and two extreme high refractive (XHR) elements. The lens accommodates 72mm filters.</div>

<div><strong>TAMRON SONY E-MOUNT<img alt="" style="float: right;" src="http://www.pdnonline.com/static/content_images/Tamron-B001_2lenses_silo.jpg" /></strong></div>
<div>The 18–200mm f/3.5–6.3 Di III VC has a focal range equivalent of 27–300mm, versatility that earns Tamron’s “all-in-one” lens designation.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>From group and environmental portraits to distant shots, this lens functions as an all-purpose accessory for Sony E-mount cameras. At f/3.5–6.3, the lens is slower than others mentioned here but is more than acceptable given a decent amount of natural or artificial light. Plus it’s stabilized, so the camera/lens combo can be easily handheld at slower shutter speeds.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>A stepping motor promises improved AF  and, thanks to a moving magnet system and smaller coils, vibration compensation is more effective while keeping the lens’ size and weight to a minimum. The lens is relatively lightweight and compact, weighing in at 16.2 ounces and measuring 2.7x4 inches. Available in all black or black and silver, the 18–200mm lens has a 62mm filter thread.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>PRICE: </strong>$739  </div>

<div><strong><img alt="" style="float: left;" src="http://www.pdnonline.com/static/content_images/Sony-SEL35F28Z_A.jpg" />SONY FE/E-MOUNT</strong></div>
<div>With the launch of Sony’s groundbreaking full-frame mirrorless cameras–the A7, A7R, and A7S–the company also introduced its new FE lens mount. New FE lenses will work on Sony’s APS-C E-mount mirrorless cameras, but older lenses built for APS-C cameras do not cover the full-frame image circle. You'll need to set the camera to either crop the image (on or auto) or you'll end up with a vignette on the full-frame A7/R/S. While the FE line is growing, one of the first FE models available is particularly notable: the Sonnar T* FE 35mm f/2.8 ZA. The 35mm focal length—when used on a full-frame camera—works well for any number of shooting situations, while its 50mm full- frame equivalent on E-mount cameras is also extremely useful.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>In addition to being fast at the wide end (f/2.8), the aperture range extends to f/22. A seven-bladed circular aperture brings the bokeh while a dust- and moisture-resistant housing protects the lens’ seven elements (including three aspheric) from nature’s wrath. At just more than two inches long and less than 1.5 inches wide, this tiny prime lens is convenient enough to carry on location. It weighs 10.8 ounces with a filter diameter of 49mm.</div>

<div><strong>PANASONIC MICRO FOUR THIRDS<img alt="" style="float: right;" src="http://www.pdnonline.com/static/content_images/Panasonic-H_HS35100_front_slant.jpg" /></strong></div>
<div>Mirrorless systems not only feature smaller cameras but smaller lenses as well, and that’s a huge benefit when shooting telephoto. Panasonic’s Lumix G X Vario 35–100mm f/2.8 ASPH lens (with an equivalent 70–200mm focal length) packs a popular zoom range into a fast but compact package. Measuring 2.7x3.9 inches and weighing a mere 12.7 ounces, it’s downright diminutive next to the equivalent lenses on DLSRs.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Though small, this lens doesn’t lack for the features that pros want, such as powerful optical image stabilization. It’s constructed with 18 elements in 13 groups with two ED lenses and one UED lens, has Nano surface coating, and a seven-bladed circular aperture.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The f/2.8–22 aperture range is excellent for varying your depth-of-field, and you can focus on objects as close as 2.8 feet. It also features an almost silent power zoom and accepts optional 58mm filters.</div>

<div><strong><img alt="" style="float: left;" src="http://www.pdnonline.com/static/content_images/Sigma-60mm-DN.jpg" />SIGMA MICRO FOUR THIRDS AND SONY E-MOUNT</strong></div>
<div>Sigma now offers a trio of f/2.8 prime lenses for both MFT and Sony E-mount cameras: 19mm, 30mm and 60mm. Available in either silver or black, this lens is part of Sigma’s Art lens lineup. Mounted on an MFT camera, the lens delivers a 120mm focal length; with Sony E-mount models, the focal length shortens to 90mm. Both versions have a minimum focusing distance of just under 20 inches. Built with eight elements in six groups, this lens features a new linear AF motor—eliminating the need for gears or other mechanical parts when focusing—which means you’ll enjoy quiet AF operation. Chromatic aberration is minimized thanks to the lens’ low dispersion glass. The lens measures a compact 2.4x2.2 inches and weighs about 6 ounces.</div>

<div>With its Loxia 35mm f/2 (2/35) and 50mm f/2 (2/50), Zeiss is christening a new lineup of manual-focus lenses for full-frame E-mount cameras (FE). The two lenses offer mechanical aperture settings with a maximum aperture of f/2 and the ability to deactivate the click-stop so you’ll be able to change the aperture silently during video recording. Both lenses offer a 180-degree angle of rotation on the focus ring, allowing for ultra- precise focusing. The 2/50 has a minimum focusing distance of 1.2 feet while the 2/35 can focus on objects as close as 11.8 inches away. The all-metal lens barrels have weather sealing at the mounts to protect camera and lens from inclement weather. While both lenses debuted at Photokina, only the 2/50 is shipping now. Zeiss promises the 35mm will be on store shelves by the end of the year.</div>

<div><strong><img alt="" style="float: left;" src="http://www.pdnonline.com/static/content_images/Olympus__stand__M1240_BLK_standard_______.jpg" />OLYMPUS MICRO FOUR THIRDS</strong></div>
<div>The first in Olympus’ new Pro line of lenses, this 12–40mm zoom (24–80mm full-frame equivalent) offers the same splash-proof, dust-proof and freeze-proof construction as its E-M1, E-M5 and E-M10 cameras. Given its wide-to-mid telephoto focal range, along with its manual-focus clutch (to switch easily between AF and MF), this lens offers the flexibility that pros will appreciate.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>While it may not be the fastest Micro Four Thirds (MFT) lens in terms of maximum aperture, the Pro 12–40mm offers a constant f/2.8 throughout the zoom range. Other benefits include its video- and still-compatible drive system for fast and quiet AF, along with its seven-blade circular aperture. </div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>It features 14 elements in nine groups, a minimum f-stop of f/22 and accepts 62mm filters. It measures 2.75x3.30 inches and weighs 13.47 ounces.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>There will also be a new member to the Pro lens family in stores this month. Announced at Photokina, the M.Zuiko 40–150mm f/2.8 Pro lens is positioned as a handheld telephoto lens, weighing just 30.6 ounces with the removable tripod plate attached. The lens offers 11 weather seals to protect against the elements and optical image stabilization that’s CIPA rated at 3.5 stops.</div>

<div>A rather exotic lens to be sure, the Voigtl&auml;nder Nokton 42.5mm (85mm equivalent) f/0.95 is compatible with MFT-mount cameras. It combines an ideal portrait focal length with a super bright and exceedingly fast maximum aperture that you’re not going to find in standard lenses. Beyond the low-light capability, the Voigtl&auml;nder 42.5mm’s Selective Aperture Control System offers a stepless (de-clicked) aperture ring for pinpoint aperture control as well as silent operation during video capture.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>There will be no AF-searching sound on your videos, since this is a manual focus lens; just be sure to hone your manual focusing skills. In addition to a ten-blade diaphragm, the lens features 11 elements in eight groups, including one super high refractive element and one aspherical element. It focuses as close as 9.06 inches and has a minimum aperture setting of f/16. Although the Voigtl&auml;nder Nokton weighs a relatively hefty 1.26 pounds thanks to an all-metal barrel construction, it’s nicely compact at 2.53x2.94 inches.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>PRICE: </strong>$999  </div>
<div><strong>INFO:</strong> <a href="http://www.voigtlaender.de/">www.voigtlaender.de</a><br /><br /><em>Correction: An earlier version of this article stated in the description of the Sony FE/E-Mount lenses that older lenses built for APS-C cameras will not work on the full-frame A7/R/S.

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div><em><a href="http://mcnairevans.com/projects/confessions-son/">Confessions For a Son</a></em> is a new monograph by photographer <a href="http://mcnairevans.com/">McNair Evans</a> that grapples with the past and present of a storied Southern family. The work is an engrossing interrogation of the relationship between parent and child, guilt and regret, love and loss. It’s a settling of accounts—that thankless work which the dead bequeath to the living. </div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The roots of this remarkable book lie in the sudden passing of Evans’ 70-year-old father, McNair Evans Sr, in 2000. That loss was soon followed by the realization that the family business was insolvent and the family’s finances were in ruins, a fact that the patriarch had been hiding from his family. Evans, a college anthropology student at the time, was a full semester away from his first foray into photography. During the subsequent years, he seldom spent time in his hometown of Laurinburg, North Carolina, which made it easier to avoid facing the complex emotions surrounding his relationship to his deceased father. </div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Having moved to San Francisco after college, his first extended trip home was in 2008. The town of Laurinberg was in a deep depression: empty storefronts downtown and failed franchises on the periphery. Given the size and prominence of the family businesses in Laurinberg, Evans knew that the causes and ramifications of the town’s economic collapse were intertwined with his family’s declining fortunes.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>“My great-great-grandfather John F. McNair was a Civil War soldier who, like many at that time, returned home and busied himself with farming and business,” Evans explains. “By the time my father finished college this had grown into a family enterprise with farmland throughout the Southeastern United States, as well as oil refineries, railroading, banking, insurance, fertilizer production and much more.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Back in San Francisco, Evans began shooting abandoned commercial and office spaces in the city’s downtown amidst the country’s historic economic downturn. The more he worked on the project, the more he recognized that photographs he had intended primarily as a critique of the American economy had become something much more intimate. His camera lingered on the human element: forgotten personal items, stains on carpets, notes on whiteboards.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>“By listening to my photographs, I realized there was something else being communicated than what I set out to do,” Evans remembers. He realized the images of loss and isolation he was making were motivated not by a frustration with the system, but “with my family, with my dad. I was like those people who moved out of those office spaces. They were a metaphor for me.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Evans decided he had to confront those emotions artistically, at their source. In November of 2009, he returned to Laurinburg for two weeks and took, in his own estimation, the best photographs of his life. The next month he moved home, relying on his mother’s hospitality and using the project as a means to uncover who his father truly was as a husband, a co-worker and a son himself.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The result is <em>Confessions for a Son</em>, a book that captures the Evans family, its history and the land upon which it had subsisted for generations, with a Faulknerian compass. A once-proud house sags amidst thorns and brambles—whether its former grandeur weighs upon its shoulders or props it up, one cannot say. Images show rutted dirt roads, huddled black turkeys, felled trees and ransacked offices, strewn with scraps of paper. Old photographs— with their sun-bleached hues and practical framing—show children at play, neat yards and squealing newborns. Worn hands seek ancient runes in the bark of trees they have known all their lives, and grandfather’s rifle, wrapped tidily in newspaper, is thrown in a river.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Evans knew that his narrative approach would be both autobiographical and a biographical look at his father. He shot the project entirely on film, with a 4x5 Shen Hao field camera and a 6x7 Mamiya rangefinder. He worked steadily for a year, using the seasons to frame his father’s story, ending on the tenth anniversary of his passing. Given the economic situation in Laurinburg, empty spaces were plentiful, and Evans found a former art store he was able to use as a studio. He edited while shooting, tacking up 4x5 contact proofs on walls of the cavernous building.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>As the project took shape, Evans made a discovery that would expand the book’s scope. Family lore had it that all the photographs from his childhood had been lost in a 1983 house fire, but in December 2012, Evans unearthed a trove of his father’s photographs, 8mm film reels and processed negatives from the back of a closet. Evans would eventually incorporate some of those images into the book, creating a cross-generational visual dialogue stretching 50 years into the past. </div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>After winning a residency at San Francisco’s <a href="http://raykophotocenter.com/">RayKo Photo Center</a> and gallery, Evans exhibited “Confessions for a Son” in November 2013. The show allowed him to re-envision his work. “From the beginning I had always seen this as a book project, but my dummies kept feeling flat. [The exhibition] changed everything for me,” he says, “because the two processes are so different. Creating an exhibition was a completely new way to look at the pictures, and it helped me understand the work beyond the previous book sequences I had made.”</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Repurposing the work for gallery walls forced him to break with his previous layouts and sequencing choices, to look at everything with fresh eyes. The spatial demands of the show also helped him find ways to incorporate disparate paraphernalia—written text, his father’s photography, business records, personal correspondence— into his book’s final drafts on a scale that informed his images, rather than overwhelming them. Evans credits the residency for giving him the resources to experiment with his archival discoveries, pushing boundaries that he might not have otherwise. </div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Evans’s work treads ground—the death of a patriarch, financial ruin, family secrets—that remains sensitive for those close to him. He acknowledges that it was very difficult for some in his family to accept that he would not “let sleeping dogs lie.” He pressed on with the project, undeterred, in part because he felt that no one in the family was communicating about what had happened or addressing their own feelings in the wake of the tragedies, both personal and financial. The work became a means for him and his family to confront things that had never truly been aired, he says. His faith in the transformative properties of photography was buoyed as the project picked up momentum and critical acclaim, and became an affirmation of the family’s fight to pick up the pieces.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>“What we went through, that was really something serious,” Evans says. “And it was okay to be sad about that, to be pissed off and angry. And that has been really helpful for me and my immediate family.”</div>]]></article_text>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div>One of the challenges of shooting motion is squaring clients’ high expectations for production value with their tight budgets. Many clients still see motion as an add-on to a still shoot, with little understanding of what motion production requires. “We hear over and over that motion is secondary,” says <a href="http://www.jimhughesphoto.com/">photographer Jim Hughes</a>. “Clients tell us, ‘Just shoot me a bunch of [video] and we’ll figure something out.’”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Photographers with motion experience know better than to fall into that trap. So what strategies do they use to manage clients’ expectations, and get them to invest more in all the elements required for a video production? How do photographer/ directors work around low budgets, without sacrificing the quality of the final product? And what are some budget line items that experienced photographer/directors won’t sacrifice, no matter what?</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Hughes emphasizes that because budgets are almost always tight, his job is to help clients understand what is possible--and what isn’t—within their budget. He starts by explaining the cost of a production that delivers everything they ask for, the way they ask for it.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“I tell them, If you want A-level production, here’s what you’re going to need. I hold the integrity of pricing,” he says. From there, clients inevitably ask: What can we get done for five grand rather than 25 grand?</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“My rep says, ‘They come to you for a solution.’” Hughes explains, adding that the more creative freedom a client is willing to give—i.e., the less specific the client is about details of the final production—the more Hughes can do with a bare-bones budget.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“There are so many places you can cut a production budget. It all depends upon what the shoot is about. So I ask questions to the point where it’s like beating a dead horse.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The questions help him figure out what the most important on-camera elements are.</div>
        <div>“If it’s all about the talent, and the location doesn’t matter so much,” a plain, simple room might do, Hughes explains. “Is the talent in the background? Fine. Maybe you don’t need a stylist; maybe you need a groomer instead.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Hughes first looks at ways to cut the biggest expense: the crew. Often that means he has to wear multiple hats: director, director of photography and grip. “I’m cutting out luxuries,” he says. “Can we live without craft services and deal with sandwiches from across the street? Do we need a PA [production assistant], or can the producer take care of PA tasks first thing in the morning? For hair and makeup, can we get someone junior?”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>But Hughes has his line in the sand, beyond which he won’t accept a job because the budget would only sabotage the shoot. He recounts a big job he recently walked away from—”They were surprised,” Hughes says, and he struggled with his decision—but the client kept insisting on a long list of shots in multiple locations with complicated props. Hughes didn’t think he could possibly do it for what the client was willing to spend, and feared that he’d have a black mark on his reputation if he tried.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Jesse Scolaro, who produces still and video shoots at <a href="http://thebendcreative.com/index.html">Bend Creative</a> for photographers and directors, says his spending priority is usually the production details that appear on camera. He recently produced a shoot for a juice company that started as still photography only. The day before the shoot, the agency told the client, “We have this crew. What if we include a motion component?” The client went for it, Scolaro says. Suddenly the budget doubled.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“It freed up funds to increase the scope of what we were capturing,” he says. In addition to hiring a camera crew for the motion component of the shoot, Scolaro spent more on art direction. “Our production designer was able to add a crew person, and we had the budget for better props,” he says.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Though photographers pride themselves on figuring out how to make a production work on a bare-bones budget, they often have budget line items they’re reluctant—or outright unwilling—to sacrifice. For Scolaro, it’s a digital tech, who is on set to manage media, back up and secure image files, and make sure camera cards are not corrupted.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Scolaro has insisted on hiring a digital tech for every production since having a near miss on a job a few years ago. “We were just going to have a camera person copy cards at the end of the day” to save the cost of hiring a digital tech, he says. But they ended up hiring the digital tech, who discovered during the shoot that some camera cards that looked fine when played back in-camera were actually corrupted. The crew was able to re-shoot important scenes on the spot that would have been lost otherwise.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>At press time, Scolaro was trying to convince a footwear client to send a digital tech along with a director, director of photography (DP), and producer on a multi-city tour in Asia to shoot videos featuring celebrities. “We’re going to be in cities where there aren’t a lot of reliable production resources,” Scolaro says. “It’s penny-wise and pound-foolish to travel without a digital tech. God forbid there’s a problem. You’ve sacrificed your entire budget if you don’t have that crew person there.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Lifestyle photographer <a href="http://www.stephanierausser.com/">Stephanie Rausser </a>says her make-or-break budget requirement is money for a DP. “For a long time I was my own DP. I’ve learned from doing it one too many times that to be a good art director and be in communication with people on my crew, I can’t be behind the camera,” she says.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Rausser says that getting models comfortable with one another and directing action on set requires a lot of her time and attention. “I’m a very vocal director. I found that when I was behind the camera, I couldn’t also speak,” she says, explaining that she was too preoccupied by framing the images, anticipating the next shot and worrying about changes in the light. “It was very stressful.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>For Rausser, a DP (or a day dedicated to shooting video) is fundamentally about enabling herself to achieve the look and feel that defines her visual style. It’s also what motivates other photographers to protect certain production budget line items. Hughes says the last thing he’ll cut is lighting and equipment, such as the expensive prime lenses he uses. “I don’t like to cut on our tools—those are making the nice beautiful pictures that clients hire us for,” he says.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Photographer <a href="http://jonathanchapman.com/">Jonathan Chapman</a> says the look of his videos is dependent upon having multiple cameras at work.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“To have one camera trying to get [everything], that’s just not my approach to visuals,” he says. “My business model is based on really exploring from subtle details to the broad overview. That’s what clients have grown to love in the way I work,” he says. Getting those details, he says, requires a second, third or even a fourth set of eyes. (For a recent Target C-9 shoot, he worked with four camera crews.)</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Chapman hires DPs who understand his workflow and visual style. “You’re tag-teaming to get two shots in one,” he says. “I almost always direct the scene and run the A camera while the secondary camera is there, positioned to capture an alternate angle that complements my shot.” While Chapman is reviewing shots or discussing ideas with the client, a second camera crew can look for details that aren’t necessarily scripted, and that clients wouldn’t want Chapman to spend time shooting, but “really are the backbone of the edits.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>On a creative call for a Samsung assignment, the creative director mentioned a b-roll cut on one of Chapman’s videos for McDonald’s that showed the talent’s hands on a counter. It was “a little element, a little nuance” that the CD loved, he says. “That’s not a shot I might have had time on my own to grab on a production for McDonald’s, but having a second camera on set allows us to capture a broader library of those subtle but impactful moments.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>And therein lies the challenge for photographer and their producers: convincing clients to spend money on production extras—and even essentials—that they don’t understand the value of, simply because they can’t pre-visualize the results. The production sacrifices you end up making can depend heavily the sales skills you bring to the bidding process and creative calls, long before you get on set for the shoot.</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div>The increased accessibility of filmmaking technology in the past five years has invited legions of still photographers to consider the possibilities of the moving image. While commercial and editorial photographers have led the charge into video, fine artists are also increasingly producing motion work, seeking new opportunities to realize concepts, and finding new audiences for their work among collectors and institutions. It’s now common to see video pieces included in photography exhibitions like MoMA’s annual New Photography show, and to see motion work on the walls of the booths of photography dealers at AIPAD and other art fairs.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Technological development is also helping collectors get comfortable with the idea of purchasing video-based art. Buying video works no longer means committing to the installation of a bulky television or finding the space for a projector—they can now be displayed seamlessly on slim monitors hung cleanly on a wall. “Media work is more consumable and is more widely available than it once was, and so by extension it becomes more collectible,” says <a href="http://cclarkgallery.com/">Catharine Clark, a San Francisco-based gallerist</a> who has represented video artists for more than two decades.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>When artists initially began working with video decades ago, they weren’t thinking they could sell the work, Clark says. “I think they were just really interested in the form, and it’s happened that a market has developed from that.” As video technology has become more accessible, making video work has become more financially viable for artists, which in turn has made video work more financially accessible to collectors. “[Artists] can make things that are easier for collectors to consume without breaking the bank,” Clark adds.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><a href="http://www.edelmangallery.com/">Catherine Edelman, a Chicago gallerist</a> and AIPAD member, says she has “tiptoed” into the video-art market in the past decade after years of showing only photography, but is “severely looking” for artists who work with video to represent. She currently shows <a href="http://www.gregoryscottimages.com/">Gregory Scott’s</a> work, which combines elements of photography, painting and video into wall-based pieces that offer “a dialogue about art history” to which audiences and collectors have responded positively.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Scott, who opened a solo exhibition at Edelman’s gallery this past September, first worked with Edelman when he was making still photographs. She offered his photographs non-exclusively as part of her online print sales platform called <a href="http://www.edelmangallery.com/artists/artist-archive/chicago-project.html">The Chicago Project</a>. After Scott began incorporating video into his work during his MFA studies, Edelman started representing him. She first showed Scott’s work at Art Miami in 2008. Both she and Scott were new to the video market, and they priced the work, which is displayed in a custom-built, self-contained piece that collectors just have to hang and plug in, at $16,000 to $22,000 for editions of five. The works sold out in a couple of days. “We were delightfully taken aback,” Edelman recalls. Now his prices start at $28,000 and sell out at $34,000, and they offer them in editions of eight “to meet demand for his work through other venues and dealers” that want to show and sell the work.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Working with Scott has “completely expanded our market,” Edelman says. Few collectors of traditional photography buy Scott’s work, she says. “Most of the people who are buying it collect contemporary art in that broader sense of the word.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Dutch artist <a href="http://www.charlottedumas.nl/">Charlotte Dumas</a>, known for her photographs of horses and other animals depicted in the tradition of Dutch portraiture, ventured into video art while working on a series of works commissioned by the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. While Dumas was photographing the horses used in ceremonial burials at Arlington National Cemetery, she captured video of the animals as they fell asleep. She didn’t intend to make a work from the footage, but the experience of seeing the horses nod off was enthralling. “I just felt like it would be stupid not to videotape them to have the footage.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Creating video work was, she says, “something that crossed my mind before, like many photographers who’ve watched their subject” move and have wanted to translate what they see for an audience. When she reviewed what she’d shot, she felt the material was too valuable to ignore. Dumas decided to rough out a “sketch” of a video piece that combined footage of a few of the horses. She showed the sketch during an exhibition of her stills at a vintage photo archive in Holland.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Representatives of a large corporate collection happened to be at the archive during Dumas’ exhibition. They saw the video and wanted to buy it, Dumas says. She took encouragement from their interest and worked with an editor to finish and color grade the piece, which has been shown in her solo exhibitions, group shows and in film festivals, broadening the audience for her work. She has also sold her video to both collectors and institutions.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Dumas went on to make a second film about Nevada’s wild horses, and she is currently working on a third film about horses that work with loggers. “I was lucky enough that the first one was sort of a hit, and that gives you the confidence to make a second one.” Dumas plans to show all three films at a major exhibition she is planning for next year at Museum De Ponte in the Netherlands. Curators she is working with are very enthusiastic about showing the video work, she says, and “people who would not have otherwise seen my work” are now interested.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Last year, <a href="http://www.richardmosse.com/">Richard Mosse</a>, who has worked with both photography and motion pictures, debuted an ambitious multi-channel video and audio work at the Venice Biennale. Called “The Enclave,” the 40-minute piece was created with the help of a cinematographer, production assistant and an electronic musician, who worked with Mosse in eastern Congo creating a piece that seeks to present the humanitarian disaster there “in an entirely new light, to refresh people’s attention and raise visibility,” Mosse says. The piece has “completely” expanded the audience for Mosse’s work. “It is a highly immersive multimedia environment which brings together photography, music and sculpture. Audiences of all kinds, not just the art cognoscenti or untouchable curators, respond to that. Museums generally like and actually need works of art that can speak to a broad spectrum of people.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Mosse says that though the cost of installing the piece does limit its potential audience, “Exhibitions of ‘The Enclave’ have been scheduled in 21 different cities, and the work has drawn large audiences.” Mosse adds, “The most amazing thing has been walking into installations of ‘The Enclave’ and sometimes finding crowds of people sitting within the space trying to dissect the piece, moving around the space.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><a href="http://www.saulgallery.com/">Julie Saul Gallery</a>, which represents Dumas in the United States, also represents <a href="http://www.magyaradam.com/">Adam Magyar</a>, another artist who began creating videos after working with photography, and who has seen the market for his work expand as a result. According to the gallery’s director, Edna Cardinale, Magyar began making video work after Anne Wilkes Tucker, the longtime photography curator at the Museum of Fine Arts Houston, saw a video Magyar made to show the creative process behind his “Stainless” series of photographs, which depict travelers on subway trains in cities around the world. She encouraged Magyar to sell the video as a fine-art work in and of itself, and eventually bought it for the MFAH collection. Magyar has gone on to create several videos.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Following media coverage of his work, the views on a pair of excerpts that he posted on Vimeo spiked. As of this writing, two of the excerpts had more than 800,000 views. The interest led to a mass of inquiries about his work, Cardinale says. “People who weren’t necessarily collectors were contacting us and purchasing work.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Magyar is very technically savvy, Cardinale says, and is willing to tailor the format of the work to the needs of collectors, which she says is helpful, especially with collectors who haven’t previously bought video work. Long-time video collectors are comfortable with how they are going to present work and often have their display equipment sorted out. “Then you have collectors who might like a video, but then they say, ‘What am I going to do with it?’”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Clark sees fewer and fewer technical questions about the display and longevity of video art from collectors and institutions. Just as photography was at one time thought of as a lesser medium in contemporary art circles, video was once marginalized. Now, “video is more integrated into people’s practices,” Clark says. “It’s not a shocking phenomenon. It seems part and parcel of what artists do: They have tools at their disposal and because video is so readily available, that’s just one of the many tools.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Edelman has also noticed that more young artists coming out of MFA programs are “mixing the media in which they’re immersed,” and extending into video work.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>During his MFA work in the ICP-Bard Program in Advanced Photographic Studies, <a href="http://www.michaelitkoff.com/">Michael Itkoff</a> continued an interest in video-based work that began when he was an undergrad at Sarah Lawrence. Recently Itkoff produced a series of looped video works that appropriate imagery from 20th century instruction manuals for activities like yoga and karate. New York gallery <a href="http://housprojects.com/">Haus Projects</a> showed the “How To” videos, as he calls them, at Photo LA. <a href="http://kopeikingallery.com/">Paul Kopeikin</a> saw the videos there and has been showing them since.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Itkoff sees his video work as part of his evolution as an artist and his “exploration of various ways to tell stories, and partly it is in response to the frustration of the limitations of typical photo-based projects.” He hopes that existing collectors and patrons “will come with me on this journey,” and that “more people will have a chance to see this work that might not be involved in the traditional photo world.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Clark notes that while there are distinct video collectors, “There are a good number of people who buy videos and photographs.” With artists like <a href="http://www.ninakatchadourian.com/">Nina Katchadourian</a>, whose practice results in both photo- and video-based work, collectors who have a video work often want a photograph, and vice versa.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>There are “clearly more people who just buy photographs,” Clark admits, noting that video editions are smaller and there are fewer video works available in general. She also believes that a lot of beginning collectors are inclined towards traditional media because “we think about art [as] something that resides on the wall.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>But she also thinks it’s easier to sell video art than sculpture now. With her younger collectors, she sees “less bias about new media.” And she predicts that young people who become collectors in the years to come will have “zero of these questions” about how to value and display video art.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>"There is something about video that is so accessible today," adds Edelman. "We're all looking for that person who gets our heart going, and [video] is the one avenue that I'm definitely seeking."</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div>A recent assignment for the Apartamento 03 clothing line inspired fashion photographer <a href="http://www.gusmarx.com/">Gustavo Marx</a> to look to his past and shoot in a way he hadn’t shot in years. The Brazil-born Marx—now based in New York City—has worked many times with Luiz Cl&aacute;udio, designer and founder of Apartamento 03. In designing his Autumn/Winter 2014 line, Cl&aacute;udio had taken inspiration from his memories of his grandmother’s sister, a woman who always presented herself to her family in elegant, glamorous clothes though she had little money and lived quietly on her own. To help Marx understand the woman he had in mind, Cl&aacute;udio showed the photographer images by Lillian Bassman, a master fashion photographer who shot for <em>Harper’s Bazaar</em> in the ’50s and ’60s. Known for her elegant compositions and grainy, high- contrast black-and-white imagery, Bassman had photographed urbane, sophisticated women who reminded Cl&aacute;udio of his great aunt. Says Marx, “I could immediately relate his memories to Bassman’s work because of the dreamy black-and-white, the silhouettes, the dresses.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Marx, who is known for executing sleek, polished and richly colorful imagery in his advertising assignments, was eager to try to emulate the artistic spirit he saw in Bassman’s imagery. “She was working and shooting in what seems to be a very free environment,” he says of Bassman, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the legendary art director Alexey Brodovich. On the Apartamento 03 shoot, he decided to shoot a handheld camera on a simple, spare set and use a minimal lighting setup that would allow him the freedom to follow the model, photographing any gestures or movements that appealed to him.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“I wanted to go back to my roots, and not be overthinking everything,” he says.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>LOGISTICS</strong></div>
        <div>In January of this year, Marx and his crew—which included his long time stylist, <a href="http://www.marianasucupira.com/">Mariana Sucupira</a>—arrived in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, where Apartemento 03 is based. They had only five days to prepare.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Marx cast the model himself, after meeting her in person. “I like to have a conversation with models three or four days before a shoot. I’ll send references to the bookers or show them the things I love in their work.” These words of guidance and encouragement, he says, make directing the model easier once the shoot begins.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Marx rented a local photographer’s studio that had a white cyclorama. The day before the shoot, he managed to find a smoke machine. This added more to the shoot than atmosphere alone, he says. “I thought: I don’t want this model to see me all the time. I told her that I wanted to be invisible to her.” He described the woman who had inspired Cl&aacute;udio, but gave the model no script. Instead, he encouraged her to interpret the character as she wished. He sent most of the crew out of the studio, leaving only himself, Cl&aacute;udio, the graphic designer and the stylist, to eliminate any distractions for the model. “I wanted her to feel she was in her own world,” he explains.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>LIGHTING</strong></div>
        <div>Marx typically uses strobes, but for the Apartamento 03 shoot, he wanted the model to move all the time, so he chose to use continuous lights. “I didn’t want to lose any single shot because of recycling time.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>He had his assistants set up three 1200-watt HMIs about 15 feet apart in a simple triangle shape. One, placed at the back, was on a stand about 10 feet high; the two in the front were six to seven feet high. The model was in the middle, turning, walking, dancing, stretching or adjusting her clothes, while Marx moved around her, shooting handheld from just outside the triangle of lights. “I was walking around her trying to find the best things to shoot,” he recalls.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>After he photographed the first outfit, he began trying subtle variations in the lighting, adjusting the angle of one of the shorter lights with his left hand while continuing to operate his camera with his right. With each adjustment he would watch how the shadows changed, or how the light looked when it hit the hazy wall of smoke.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>In some of the shots he took, a light stand or the silhouette of the stylist was visible within the frame. “I thought, I don’t mind, because I’m not losing this beautiful angle I see here.” He let the designer preview these shots, he says, “and the client was saying: ‘Go for it.’”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>CAMERA</strong></div>
        <div>The precision and resolution of modern digital cameras seemed poorly suited to a shoot inspired by the romanticism and contrast of the images that Bassman had shot on black-and-white film, so Marx turned to an older technology. “I used an old Contax 645 camera and an old digital back. The combination of those with old, soft Contax lenses was right for the final look,” he says.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Wanting to be able to move freely around the studio, Marx chose not to shoot tethered. Instead, as he tried different shots, he would occasionally check the results on the small screen of the digital back, Leaf Aptus II 5, and show them to the graphic designer and Cl&aacute;udio.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>To make sure there was visible grain in the images, he shot at ISO 200, he says. “I shot half of the job at f/2.8 and the other at f/3.5.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The shoot took about five hours, he says. “This shoot was a statement from me: I need to do more with less.” On more recent shoots, Marx has tried to rely less on well-planned formulas, and to allow for spontaneity, as he did while shooting the Apartamento 03 assignment. “I think it was a return to the best of my work years ago,” he says.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>POST PRODUCTION</strong></div>
        <div>Once Marx had finished shooting one look and the model was changing clothes, Marx’s assistant downloaded images to a computer, then printed four or five of the favorites as 4x5s using an Epson inkjet printer. To make their final selection, the designer and Marx reviewed all the proofs tacked to a blank wall, and chose nine images for the brochure and campaign. Says Marx, “That was truly, truly amazing. I don’t usually make a selection on the day of the shoot. I think it’s because I’m usually really tired. But this day was magical.” He had not hired a retoucher for the job; his only post-production work was to enhance the vignetting and grain himself using Alien Skin Exposure 6 software.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The images were printed in a brochure and on the designer’s website. During the image selection process, the client also photographed the wall of prints, and posted his images to his Instagram account to provide customers and press a sneak peek at his next collection. Marx’s images were also made into 18x24-inch prints and sent as a portfolio to members of the fashion press.</div>

        <div>With its January 2014 issue, the venerable <em><a href="http://www.rd.com/">Reader’s Digest</a></em> brand unveiled a redesign that transformed the print magazine, its website and its tablet edition. Emerging from chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2013, it has since introduced new columns and larger, bolder imagery. <em>PDN</em> talked to photo director <a href="http://rebeccasimpsonsteele.com/">Rebecca Simpson Steele</a> about planning the redesign and how she assigns photographers to shoot for all the brand’s platforms. A graduate of the Rochester Institute of Technology, Steele has worked in the photo departments at several magazines, including <em>Prevention</em> and <em>Kiplinger’s Personal Finance</em>, as well as on the photography teams at the White House and the Maryland State House. Her photo direction has received awards from American Photography, <em>Photo District News</em>, the Society of Publication Designers and the <em>Folio </em>Ozzies. She co-created a photo consultation business, 2 Editors, where she helped photographers edit their work.</div>

        <div><strong>Rebecca Simpson Steele:</strong> We’re trying to create an engaging reading experience through a curated collection of uplifting, entertaining and useful stories that enrich readers’ lives. We are an uplifting oasis amid a lot of snark and negativity.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><em>Reader’s Digest</em> is among the magazines with the highest paid circulation in the world. It’s been passed down through generations. It’s something people know well and when you make changes to the brand, they notice.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: What were the goals for the redesign? </strong></div>
        <div><strong>RSS: </strong>There was a lot of emphasis on going back to look at what <em>Reader’s Digest</em>, a 92-year-old brand, had done through the years—what had worked, what it had done right. The redesign is clean, streamlined, and it’s classic in style. The emphasis is first on the reading. I think it’s valuable to know that people come to the magazine first to read great stories. As in many magazines, the pages had gotten busier, and our design director wanted to take it back to an easier reading experience where there aren’t a ton of elements and images screaming from the page.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: Is the primacy of the text a challenge for you as a photo editor?</strong></div>
        <div><strong>RSS: </strong>The photos really stand out now, [so] we’re able to make smarter, more thoughtful choices when running a photo.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: How much of the photography is assigned, and how much is pick-up?</strong></div>
        <div><strong>RSS:</strong> It depends on the issue, but I’d say the mix from the front of the book to the back is about 70-30, assigned versus existing photography. About 50 to 70 percent of the stories in the issue are curated from other sources. If we’re commissioning work, it has to be as strong as if we’d researched everything out there. If the existing art we see with the text is amazing, we’ll contact the photographer and rerun that if it fits the re-edit.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: Are there genres of photography you need often?</strong></div>
        <div><strong>RSS: </strong>We do a lot of conceptual photography to illustrate many of our stories. We often approach the photography in an illustrative way, asking how it’s adding to the piece and what it’s bringing to the reader. That can mean still lifes, studio work or concepts using models. For our “Genius” issue, we had <a href="http://www.jamiechung.com/#recent">Jamie Chung</a> photograph a beauty model “freezing.” It was for a health story titled <a href="http://www.rd.com/true-stories/survival/hypothermia-cheat-death/">“Frozen Back to Life,”</a> about how modern medicine is using lower temperatures to save lives. We had a great special-effects makeup artist adding crystals and dust and things to the face of a very willing model. We also froze medical tools and a human heart.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>We have art meetings to concept ideas that we pitch to the editor-in-chief. We tell her who we think the best photographers are for that job. The photographers have to build on the ideas once we decide to work with them, but it’s really about matching the best photographer to the concept in those cases.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: Are you relying on a stable of contributors or looking for new photographers?</strong></div>
        <div><strong>RSS:</strong> We have some established photographers for certain sections of the magazine, and other than that we’re open to new contributors. For example we started a new column with the redesign called “Faces of America.” [Photographer] <a href="http://glennglasser.com/">Glenn Glasser</a> is going around the country and meeting a lot of people, doing short interviews with them, taking their portraits, getting to know one person at a time. That’s been a really fun project. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>In the front of the book we have the “Words of Lasting Interest” column. It’s a page of thoughtful, insightful text that our editors have found. <a href="http://www.danwintersphoto.com/">Dan Winters</a> photographs that every month. He reads the text and pitches a few ideas of what he got out of it. It’s helpful in building consistency to have certain pages that have familiar looks.</div>
        </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you find photographers?</strong></div>
        <div><strong>RSS:</strong> I talk a lot to photo editors, photo producers and other people who are hiring and working with photographers. I’ve gotten a lot of recommendations that way. I look through promos I get through the mail. I love printed mailers. Emails always come in when you’re on a set or in a meeting. It’s harder to grab someone’s attention that way; we get so many emails every day. It’s nice to be able to choose when you want to go through your mail. That’s when you have time to take a break.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>I definitely look through other magazines, too. Being a general- interest magazine, we never know what’s around the corner so it’s good to know all genres of photography. I think right now <em>TIME</em> and <em>New York</em> magazine are very strong for general interest stories. I look at men’s magazines, fashion magazines, city and regional magazines, quite a range.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: Is there a photographer you hired recently who was new to <em>Reader’s Digest</em>?</strong></div>
        <div><strong>RSS:</strong> I just recently hired <a href="http://ramonarosales.com/">Ramona Rosales</a> on the recommendation of [photo editor] Moira Haney at <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>. It’s always nice to know who people have loved working with. Ramona had shot a lot of celebrity portraits on location for them that were great. I sent her to photograph <a href="http://jetsonorama.net/">Jetsonorama</a>, a street artist in Arizona who has been making amazing murals on the Navajo nation. She did a video while she was out there. They were driving around the Navaho nation, so there were wide, open roads, beautiful skies, and he was actually installing murals while she was there. I asked her if she could get some footage of this because it would be cool to see his process. We married the footage with the interview that the editor had originally done with him.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: Are you looking for photographers everywhere or do you have a budget for travel?</strong></div>
        <div><strong>RSS: </strong>We do have a small travel budget but I love to know where everyone is from, and where they like to go. If a photographer’s in a smaller market, that’s great to know.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: What’s the division of labor in your department?</strong></div>
        <div><strong>RSS: </strong>There’s myself and my photo editor, Deb Wenof. We divide up the magazine pretty evenly. She’s working on the front of the book and features and I’m working on the cover and features. We have two great assistants for the art and photo department who split their time to help with photo research and office administration.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you recommend photographers promote their work to you?</strong></div>
        <div><strong>RSS:</strong> I think that a lot of times people send out a promo that’s not reflective of their whole portfolio. I often like a mailing campaign where you’re getting a card every few weeks that is in a similar format or a card that has multiple images so you can summarize your work better. I think that often people have a great shoot, they think: This image is great, I want to share it with the world. But if it doesn’t tell me about your overall portfolio, it’s hard to pitch.</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div>In the past two years, photographer <a href="http://fwo3.com/">Frank Ockenfels 3</a> has frequently brought director of photography <a href="http://www.welleshackett.com/">Welles Hackett</a> onto shoots for AMC, FX and other TV networks requiring short motion clips that imitate the still images Ockenfels shoots.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Their first combined still/video job was on the set of <a href="http://www.starz.com/originals/blacksails"><em>Black Sails</em></a>, a series created by STARZ. Ockenfels was hired to photograph cast members on location in South Africa, but the marketing team also asked for motion clips they could use online. Ockenfels recalls, “They said, ‘We would like to marry these images together. We could have motion that’s identical to the still photography.’” Ockenfels brought in Hackett, his long-time friend; they first met 17 years ago when Ockenfels was directing music videos and commercials. For the <em>Black Sails</em> assignment, he and Hackett sometimes shot side by side in natural light, “or every time I’d step back, Welles would step in and shoot exactly what I’d been shooting.” In Hackett’s clips, he says, “It’s like my camera came alive.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Ockenfels proposed a similar idea to AMC when he was hired to shoot an image library for the show <em>Mad Men</em>. The network agreed. Since then he has worked with Hackett to deliver stills and videos for <em>Mad Men, The Walking Dead, The Killing</em>, an as-yet-to-be-released show for Netflix, and other shows.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Networks have sometimes gotten motion clips by hiring photographers to shoot video on DSLRs, “but the quality was not satisfactory to some people,” Ockenfels claims. Hackett shoots on an ALEXA, sometimes in slow-motion, and has his crew of gaffers and grips recreate Ockenfels’ lighting style with continuous lights suited to the motion camera. With network marketers demanding more and more online content that they can deliver to fans, a partnership with an experienced DP is “a relationship that’s become a necessity for work in the TV industry,” Ockenfels says.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>On each assignment, their division of labor is similar. Ockenfels positions the actors, shoots stills, and then gives the actors a few simple directions about an action they’ll perform for the motion camera. Then, Hackett shoots their action for a matter of seconds. By the time Hackett steps in, Ockenfels has typically moved on to his next task. “When we do <em>Mad Men</em>, we’re doing 54 setups in a day,” he explains. In Hackett, he has a trusted collaborator “who knows my vision so I can say: You’ve seen what I’ve done, now continue on with that thought and make it come to life.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Ockenfels adds that Hackett’s “creative, collaborative” approach extends to his crews. Many film veterans, Hackett concedes, are used to “rigid protocols” about who handles which gear. Hackett relies on a team of gaffers and grips who can be flexible and “have been very willing to learn the strobes that Frank likes, what they look like and what can be good substitutes for those lights,” he says. “My gaffer will talk to his main assistant and say, ‘Can we put this light here, will that be cool?’” Once he’s gotten the stills he needs, Ockenfels says, “My guys will work with his guys to move everything around so he can get motion.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Ockenfels says collaborating with a DP is no different from collaborating with ad agency creatives, art directors, talent and crew members. “To have an ego to say, ‘This is my picture and I don’t want to recreate it in any way but the way I see it through my lens,’ you’re missing the point of what your job is in this industry,” he says. As a photographer or as a director, he says, you’re part of a team “collaborating to achieve something interesting.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Hackett notes that he and his crew enjoy the hectic pace of the image library shoots, as well as working alongside Ockenfels and his assistants. “A large part of what I do on commercials is sitting around watching people obsess over a bowl of yogurt for hours,” he says. Shoots with Ockenfels are about getting great visuals. “The heart of the process is photographic,” he explains, “Which means I get to have the conversations I love to have: How do we make the photography better?”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The key to getting the most out of a good cinematographer, Hackett advises, is to respect their work. “Use them the way you would any other creative tool because the cinematographer is there to make your work better,” he says. “You just have to be open to that collaboration.”</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>Photographers and stock photo agencies have filed dozens of lawsuits against textbook publishers in recent years, alleging reproductions of photos that far exceed the limits of usage licenses. Courts have ruled in favor of photographers in many of the cases. Robert Frerck, for instance, won a summary judgment this month on his copyright claims against Pearson Education, and won a settlement from McGraw-Hill last May on another claim.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After reading reports that the publishers had overrun the image usage limits granted by other photographers, Frerck began buying textbooks for which he’d licensed images.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“There were numerous uses of my images that were not mentioned on the purchase orders and consequently never invoiced or licensed,” he told <em>PDN</em> in an email. “I had met many of their picture editors personally and we had developed a relationship based on trust and I considered many of them to be personal friends. So I felt betrayed when I learned that these companies were knowingly cheating me as a standard business practice.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Despite—or perhaps because of— settlements paid to Frerck and others, new claims continue to surface.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Photographer <a href="http://www.georgesteinmetz.com/">George Steinmetz</a>, a <em>National Geographic </em>contributor, sued Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in April for three dozen instances of infringement. He began checking the publisher’s uses of his images against his invoices after reading a previous report in <em>PDN </em>about infringement by textbook publishers. Steinmetz says he was reluctant to sue a client, “but at the same time, I thought it was outrageous. If someone buys a bottle of whisky and steals a six-pack of beer at the same time, it’s not right. You don’t let it go because they’re a customer.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Filing the lawsuit, he continues, “has been a major headache. I have fairly complete records, but to go back and dig all that stuff up is a chore. It’s a lot of trouble.” His advice to others: “It’s critical to make sure [you register] your copyright, hopefully before it’s infringed upon,” because that makes a huge difference in how much money you’re eligible to recover for damages.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Meanwhile, photographer <a href="http://www.jfstudio.com/">Jon Feingersh</a> filed suit against McGraw-Hill this summer, and <a href="http://www.joelgordon.com/">Joel Gordon</a> has filed separate lawsuits at various times this year against McGraw-Hill, Pearson Eduction, and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Feingersh declined a request for an interview. Gordon didn’t respond.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But the claims of both photographers follow the usual pattern. Court papers show that, according to his latest claim, Gordon granted Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH) photo usage licenses between 1990 and 2008 that “were expressly limited by number of copies, distribution area, language, duration, and/or media.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>HMH ultimately violated those limitations, according to Gordon’s claim. He does not specify the extent of the alleged infringement, explaining only that HMH has that information. But he cites a previous claim against HMH by photographer <a href="http://www.tedwoodphoto.com/">Ted Wood</a>, who had limited use of his photographs to 40,000 copies, only to discover that HMH had published more than 1 million copies. Wood won his case on summary judgment.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Gordon goes on to cite another 25 claims of copyright infringement against HMH, and he accuses the publisher of having a business model “built on a foundation of pervasive and willful copyright infringement [that] deprived Gordon and hundreds of other photographers and visual art licensors of their rightful compensation and unjustly enriched HMH.” He is seeking unspecified monetary damages, and an injunction to bar the publisher from further use of his photographs.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><a href="http://harmonseidman.com/id8.html">Attorney Maurice Harmon of Harmon &amp; Seidman LLC</a>, the lawfirm that represents Gordon, Frerck, Steinmetz, Feingersh and many other photographers for claims against textbook publishers, explained via email why these types of claims persist, and how photographers who believe their copyrights have been violated by textbook publishers can protect themselves.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: Why do these claims by photographers against textbook publishers continue to trickle out?</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>Maurice Harmon:</strong> Photographers have only gradually come to realize their photographs have been infringed. Once they know of the individual infringements, the photographers have three years to file a case.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: Do any publishers make good-faith efforts to settle the claims before photographers sue, or before claims go to trial?</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>MH: </strong>That varies greatly—but we always try to negotiate a fair settlement at every stage and 98 percent settle before trial.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: What must a photographer be prepared to endure, in terms of an investment of time and money, and/or mental anguish—to take on a textbook publisher with one of these claims?</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>MH:</strong> That also varies greatly. Some cases are resolved quickly without anything more than sending us the invoices. Other cases require more documents and a deposition. We advance all expenses, so there is no out- of-pocket cost to the photographer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: What is required for a photographer to make a strong claim?</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>MH:</strong> Invoices/licenses with terms that identify the specific licensed photographs that limit the uses a publisher can make of those images. Each photograph must also have been registered or can be registered with the Copyright Office.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: What can photographers expect to recover if they win in court?</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>MH: </strong>That depends on the extent of the unauthorized uses, the license terms and conditions, the registration status of the photographs, etc., but it has proven to be well worth our —and the photographers’—time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>:</strong> <strong>If a photographer never registered his or her image copyright, or registered after a textbook publisher misused them, does that make an infringement claim more difficult than it’s worth? [Editor’s note: Filing registration before a proven infringement makes copyright holders eligible for statutory damages, which are often much higher than actual damages.]</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>MH:</strong> Sometimes, but not always—it depends on the number of infringements after registration and the license terms and conditions.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: Aren’t these claims subject to a statute of limitations? When is it too late to make a claim?</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>MH: </strong>The photographer has three years from the date he or she knew, or reasonably should have known, about the specifics of the infringement to file a case.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: What percentage of these claims are successful? What are the most common reasons they fail—ie, they’re dismissed by a court, or a photographer recovers little or nothing in the end?</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>MH: </strong>The cases we bring have all been successful unless the plaintiff is determined by the Court to lack standing; that is, to lack ownership of the photographs. </div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        With the shift to digitize nearly every kind of imagery—from portfolios to photo albums to Christmas cards—it’s easy to forget how impactful a printed product can be. London-based fashion photographer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.benjaminkaufmann.com/">Benjamin Kaufmann</a> discovered as much when he decided to try printing his first self-promotional magazine to send to clients through the end of the year.<br />
        <br />
        “In a more and more digitalized world, a printed product makes an impression and people tend to keep it in their shelves,” says Kaufmann.<br />
        <br />
        With the holidays approaching, many photographers are opting to send small printed pieces as a gift to their contacts. Kaufmann knew he needed to think big to make his promotion stand out from the pack. It didn’t take long for him to settle on a printed magazine, which commands more attention and has an inherently longer shelf life. Kaufmann, whose clients include <em>Elle</em> and <em>Marie Claire</em>, is no stranger to beautiful, high-end glossy magazines. And because most of his clients are used to producing editorial features and advertisements in magazines, they’d appreciate the format.<br />
        <br />
        <img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/BenjaminKaufmann_004_72(1).jpg" /><br />
        <em>Above: Kaufmann opted for full-bleed images and no text to show off the high quality of his photography.</em><br />
        <br />
        With that in mind, he began looking for a partner that would help him produce the type of high-end glossy that would match the quality of his clients’ productions, both in design and printing—a subpar printed product would fall flat. When a colleague recommended Blurb, Kaufmann was more than a little intrigued. As he discovered, Kaufmann says, the self-publishing company offered a straightforward approach, a simple process, and a wide variety of custom options, from design tools to paper choice to printing quantity.<br />
        <br />
        The ease of use was certainly a selling point for Kaufmann, but it was the customizability of Blurb that sealed the deal. Prior to working as a fashion and beauty photographer, Kaufmann spent many years in graphic design. With Blurb, thanks to their plug-ins for professional design applications like Adobe InDesign and Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, Kaufmann could create a completely original magazine design that took advantage of his graphic design skills and avoided the cookie-cutter layouts that plague many self-publishing efforts. <br />
        <br />
        Blurb also has its own proprietary program, BookWright, which makes it incredibly easy to create customized layouts for those that aren’t experts at InDesign. BookWright uses a “what-you-see-is-what-you-get” approach to layout design that makes it simple to move images and text around and test their professionally designed layouts or unique, personalized ones. <br />
        <br />
        Blurb allows orders of one copy all the way up to 500, allowing the ability to print for specific events, client types or contacts. With this level of personalization, photographers have more creative control to easily tailor their books to the interests of different contact groups, or even single contacts.<br />
        <br />
        “The more one communicates on a personal level with clients and the more effort one puts into self-marketing, the greater the feedback will be,” says Kaufmann. “The idea of creating a book or magazine with pictures specifically for one person is very intriguing.”<br />
        <br />
        <img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/Angle-45---Inside-2.jpg" /><br />
        <em>Above: A two-page spread in Kaufmann's magazine.</em><br />
        <br />
        Kaufmann is wary, however, of using printed books and magazines as a first point of contact. He believes printing hundreds of copies of a book and sending it to random prospective clients would hardly produce a good return on investment. Printing a limited run for established contacts is more effective route, and, additionally, on-demand printing allows him to quickly follow up with a new client to solidify a relationship. <br />
        <br />
        “That's the beauty of digital printing,” Kaufmann says. “You can react quickly and get printed only what you need at any given moment.”<br />
        <br />
        Kaufmann recently completed a first run of his customized Blurb magazine, which contains a selection of his fashion, beauty, and landscape photographs. To create the glossy look, he chose the magazine format with a softcover and the Velvet Premium 80# paper. <br />
        <br />
        <img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/BenjaminKaufmann_030_72.jpg" /><br />

        <em>Above: A selection of Kaufmann's featured fashion and landscape work.</em><br />
        <br />
        “The Premium paper ensures it has the highest possible quality. That’s important when I’m trying to make an impression,” he explains. <br />
        <br />
        To ensure that the printed product matches what is designed, Kaufmann recommended calibrating your monitor before and during design. In addition, Kaufmann had a single magazine printed first as a proof so that he could check colors, layouts and the binding for errors. <br />
        <br />
        Kaufmann’s first full print run was an order of 60 magazines, and so far, they’ve been a hit. Kaufmann has used the magazines as a gift to existing clients and as a give-away during industry events. He’s even begun leaving it with clients after face-to-face appointments, which has kept him at the front of their minds when they look to their next project. The feedback, according to Kaufmann, has been amazing. He’s only had one problem: “Almost too many people want a copy.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>The effects of the housing market’s collapse in 2007 and 2008 are still being felt. But in many cities the clamor of construction heralds growth in the real estate market—in particular, of luxury residential developments. Developers of condominium and rental properties and the design firms and advertising agencies that represent them are assigning photographers to help market these spaces in a variety of media to both wealthy consumers and real estate brokers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“It now requires far more sophisticated experience-building and brand-building to attract renters and buyers because there’s a lot of competition in each one of these markets,” says Nancy Lerner, the co-founder of <a href="http://otherwiseinc.com/">Otherwise Inc.</a>, a Chicago-based branding and strategic design firm that works with real estate clients around the U.S. “For developers with very high-end and high-profile projects to compete, they have to think of them as luxury brands.” Photographers are being assigned to shoot images that can stir the aspirations of potential buyers with a taste for luxurious amenities, and are often required to shoot more than just interiors. Describing the photography her clients need, Lerner says, “Some of it is about the beauty of the product itself, but some is about being able to convey lifestyle, and in some cases [it’s about] doing both in the same visual experience.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To market a trio of newly constructed condominiums in Chicago that the developer Related Midwest had acquired and upgraded, Otherwise branded the three properties as <a href="http://www.relatedmidwest.com/ourcompany/properties/215/South-Loop-Luxury-By-Related/">South Loop Luxury by Related</a>. The initial 2013 campaign featured photography of the interiors. Then in February, Otherwise launched an email marketing and digital advertising campaign featuring lifestyle photography. “The buildings are really beautiful and we wanted to show people enjoying the life they could lead if they purchased at South Loop Luxury,” says Courtney McKeen, a marketing manager at Related Midwest.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>One ad shot by Chicago-based <a href="http://www.coscarelli.com/">Bob Coscarelli</a> shows a smiling boy holding a cello and bow near a window overlooking a lit-up Chicago skyline. In another, a dad plays with his pajama-clad kids in a bright room with a lakefront view. A third ad, shot by New York-based <a href="http://scottfrances.com/">Scott Frances</a>, shows a man who appears to be relishing both the elegant pool he’s standing in and the glance of a smiling woman walking by.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Lerner says Otherwise chose Coscarelli and Frances because of their experience shooting not only interiors, but also talent in those spaces. “The combination of the two was critically important to us,” she says.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Coscarelli, who was also hired by Otherwise to shoot a campaign for The Ritz-Carlton Residences in Chicago, notes that developers need photographers to sell a lifestyle, while at the same time capturing “the magic of the space or the grandeur or the sexiness—why that space is a $1.5 million two-bedroom condo.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Frances says that showing people in architectural advertising can help developers define and reach their target demographic, as well as illustrate a space’s size and functions.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“With architecture, it’s very hard to tell scale because it’s just lines,” says Frances, who has been a contributing photographer to <em>Architectural Digest </em>for 25 years. “The only things that give us reference of scale are things we’re familiar with—a dinner plate, a fork, a chair, or humans—so that’s an important part of using talent in architecture [photography].” </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The combination can be challenging to shoot well. “I often think about, ‘How do we frame this moment we’re going to capture with talent in such a way that we can provide context and honor the space?’” Coscarelli says. “I think it’s two different disciplines, because often the best lifestyle shooters shoot with a very impromptu approach, so in the heat of capturing a magic moment, the lighting in the space can become secondary. So then the challenge is: How do we capture the moment embellished by the light?”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Lerner recommends that photographers who want to work on luxury real estate projects approach developers directly. Many are commissioning photos directly from photographers that never appear in advertising. They may include the photos they assign in a portfolio shared with lenders, for instance, or give them as gifts to new buyers, she says.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Developers and the agencies they work with don’t only need photographers who can show the beauty of a space. When a building has yet to be completed, for example, the assignments can be more offbeat.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When the design firm <a href="http://www.pentagram.com/work/#/all/all/newest/">Pentagram</a> began working on branding for <a href="http://printinghousewestvillage.com/">The Printing House</a>—a property in Manhattan’s West Village that was being converted from rentals into luxury condos—they hired New York-based photographer David Leventi to take photos for a teaser that would be sent to brokers. His images showcased spaces that were not just empty, but completely stripped down to concrete, plaster and nails. Luke Hayman, a New York-based partner at the design consultancy Pentagram, explains, “We had to communicate, ‘No, this isn’t just a new lick of paint – this has been blown apart.”’</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Hayman believes that showing people in real estate advertising isn’t always a wise strategy. “There’s a theory that you shouldn’t put anyone in there because the idea is for you to project yourself in that space,” says Hayman. “If you see someone else in [that] life, you think, ‘Well, this is kind of someone else’s apartment. I kind of like it but I’m not sure.’”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A different way to show what life could be like for prospective residents is to spotlight the neighborhood around the development. For The Printing House, Pentagram assigned Leventi to make images of life in the West Village that would run in a brochure and on the building’s website and app. The imagery would run alongside interior photography from New York-based Pieter Estersohn that was also featured in print ads. Pentagram had hired Leventi in 2008 to make similar photos of street life around the site of a proposed building in TriBeCa. Hayman says that before Pentagram hired Leventi, the designers had first looked for stock photos of the neighborhood. “We couldn’t find many of the shots we wanted, and combining images from different photographers and different time periods would have created a bit of a visual mess.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Leventi says his images for The Printing House “romanticize the idea of living in the West Village.” He adds, “It was important to show a lot of green and brownstones, and to create the feeling of community.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Pentagram gave Leventi a list of sites to photograph that had been determined with the client, <a href="http://www.corcoransunshine.com/property/nd/newdev.aspx">Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group</a>, the real estate advertising company that works for the building’s developers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In the mix were schools, boutiques, restaurants and “everything that makes a neighborhood appealing,” Hayman says. Leventi photographed runners near the Hudson River, and people walking on a sidewalk with a line of pedicabs on one side and restaurants on the other.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“I try to take a beautiful, unique, emblematic shot of each place. It’s often easier said than done,” Leventi says. “Unfortunately, New York City is a dirty place and the majority of cars are not very photogenic and become compositional eyesores.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He’s found some creative solutions. He may capture a moving yellow taxi in a blur not only because it’s a symbol for the pace and energy of New York, he says, but also because it “serves as a blanket for a maybe not-so- appealing street level.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>While Leventi is an architectural and fine-art shooter, Hayman says that travel photographers shooting editorial assignments have the relevant skills to capture the kind of aspirational images needed for these campaigns. The goal for every real estate marketing campaign is the same, he says: “Selling a vision and a dream for an apartment and a neighborhood that you could be living in.”</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div>It takes a lot of trust for a photographer to relinquish control of their camera on set. So whether photographer <a href="http://zensekizawa.com/">Zen Sekizawa</a> is occupying the director’s chair on a motion shoot or working on a hybrid video/stills production, when she has a choice, her director of photography is always <a href="http://www.ernestolomeli.com/">Ernesto Lomeli</a>.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The pair first met on set as co-DPs on a Nike Fuel Band commercial, working for <a href="http://www.motiontheory.com/">the production company Motion Theory</a>. Sekizawa had shot print campaigns piggybacked on their productions, but with a little prodding from MTh, she soon found herself booked on gigs as a cinematographer. While confident in her lighting and stylistic choices, the sets were larger than she was used to, and she had a whole new set of tech and lingo to learn. Lomeli, a self-professed gadget nerd also working with MTh, has worked on motion sets for his entire career. Paired with Sekizawa as co-DPs, he was the perfect adviser to ease her into shooting video.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“He was very patient,” she says. “He still is. It feels like a complete collaboration. It doesn’t feel like here’s my role and here’s your role, we’re definitely working with each other.” Theirs is a collaboration built on trust, which Lomeli says “comes from a mutual respect of each other’s talent and creativity.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Since the first job for Nike, the two have become close friends, forming a formidable photographer/DP team with credits for brands such as Sony and shoe designers <a href="https://vimeo.com/98968464">Jimmy Choo</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/102158459">LD Tuttle</a>. Like any good collaboration, theirs starts with communication—the messages and conversations that happen before a shoot are crucial. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“I think the most important thing for me, working with a DP,” Sekizawa explains, “is the understanding of what it’s going to look like…if we’re coming at it with the same sort of compositional ideas.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The two exchange references—photos, books, films or anything else—to get on the same page. While most of the directors Lomeli works with are concerned with their 40-foot tracking shots and movement within the frame, Sekizawa typically references the tone and direction of the light.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>But sometimes Sezikawa will show Lomeli a film to dissect, peppering him with technical questions. How did they get the shot? What kind of camera movement was used? The answers help her understand the machinations required to execute her vision.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“I think it’s important to understand technically what’s happening,” she says. “It can be really frustrating not knowing why it’s not looking the way you want it to look.” But Sekizawa’s gains from Lomeli’s technical expertise are complemented by her openness to creative experimentation with the gadgets he loves. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Lomeli, who owns the rental house Ace Image, has access to almost any piece of gear imaginable, a luxury not all directors have. When he gets a new piece of gear, he’ll often coax Sekizawa to come up with a creative way for them to use it. One example, a slow-motion fashion video for LD Tuttle, began as an opportunity to test the PhantomFlex 4K, a high-speed camera that can capture HD footage at up to 1000 frames per second. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>They often work together on hybrid shoots, in which the client expects high-quality still and moving images from the same shoot. While such assignments can often involve separate crews and become logistical nightmares, their familiarity and fluent communication often solves many of the typical problems.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“We’re so familiar with each other that I can be in his space,” Sekizawa says. “We could be cheek-to-cheek [shooting] and it’s fine. I know when he’s about to flip a lens, and that’s when I go in and do a stills pass.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Rather than devise two sets and lighting setups, Lomeli likes to “light the room and not the set.” It can take a little longer and cost a little bit more. “Instead of putting a lot of little lights, you’re putting big giant lights through the windows,” Lomeli explains. “But once you’re set, you can point the camera in almost any direction and, barring minor tweaks, you get a real consistent look, with both cameras, motion and still.” Lomeli says clients are often surprised by how effectively and efficiently they work on complicated jobs.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>But when it comes to moving from shooting stills to directing videos, Lomeli doesn’t see that much difference between the roles of directors and photographers. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“On higher-end photo sets, the photographer is pretty much a director,” he explains. “They rarely even touch the camera. They’re talking about location, the esthetic. They don’t care what lens is on, they just know what they want it to look like. They tell somebody and it gets done. To me, that makes sense. A director is somebody with a vision of what it is we’re trying to get. How to accomplish that? That’s why you have a team of people.”</div>

        For most photographers, careers wax, wane, and evolve. Sometimes the phone stops ringing, forcing a photographer to adapt to external changes such as market shifts, or clients' changing tastes. But photographers' interests can also change over time, compelling them to re-evaluate their work and creative direction. Either way, the transition can feel lonely, and stressful. The good news is, plenty of photographers have been through the process, and figured out ways to re-charge themselves and move their careers in new directions.
        <p>The October 2014 issue of PDN features profiles of several photographers who have used their personal work to re-brand themselves. One is James Wojcik, who says, "To feel good about yourself as a photographer, you have to make work you care about." In addition to those stories, here are several others from past issues of PDN that describe various ways photographers have reinvented themselves.</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div>Over a 100-day period starting in April 1994, a media hate campaign instigated by Rwandan Hutus fomented genocide against Rwandan Tutsis. More than 800,000 people died, and the brutality shocked the world. Twenty years later, Rwanda projects a narrative of reconciliation and forgiveness. But tensions persist below the surface, and two Dutch journalists—writer Eefje Blankevoort and photographer <a href="http://www.anoeksteketee.com/">Anoek Steketee</a>—have explored them through an ambitious Web-based multimedia project that mixes fictional drama with documentary images.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Called <a href="http://www.loveradio-rwanda.org/">Love Radio</a>, the project was inspired by a popular Rwandan radio soap opera called <em>Musekeweya</em>. The soap tells the story of conflict and reconciliation between two rival villages. Love Radio, the derivative (but independently produced) Web project, includes an “On Air” channel that recreates an abridged version of <em>Musekeweya</em>. For a second “Off Air” channel, Love Radio’s creators explore contemporary life in Rwanda to assess the country’s actual progress toward reconciliation. The Love Radio project also includes essays by journalists and academics to provide additional context.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Working in collaboration with an interactive design team and with grants from a variety of arts organization and the Dutch government, Blankevoort and Steketee created the Web project, plus a pared-down version for smartphone users. They’ve also turned the project into an interactive exhibition, which was displayed at <a href="http://www.foam.org/">the Foam museum</a> in Amsterdam. As one of five winners of <a href="http://www.anotherafrica.net/news/exhibition/popcap-14-contemporary-photography-from-africa-prize-winners-announced">the 2014 POPCAP competition for contemporary African photography</a>, Love Radio will also be part of an international traveling exhibition over the next year.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The roots of the project go back to 2008, when Steketee and Blankevoort were working on a project about amusement parks around the world. On their way to Rwanda for that story, they met with George Weiss, founder of <a href="http://www.labenevolencija.org/">La Benevolencija</a>, a Dutch NGO working to empower groups that are targets of hate speech. La Benevolencija launched the <em>Musekeweya </em>radio soap in 2004 as entertainment. But its scriptwriters draw from academic theories about the origins of genocide to help prevent future violence and foster Rwanda’s process of reconciliation.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The two journalists ended up reporting a magazine story about the soap opera and its dedicated fans in 2008. “When we talked to people on the street, almost everybody knew about [<em>Musekeweya</em>], and started to shine when they talked about it,” Steketee says. “We were intrigued by the connection between the radio soap and daily life in Rwanda.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>They were also interested in the universal themes of Rwanda’s recent history: ideas of guilt and innocence, good and evil, the power of media, mob violence, individual and collective resistance, and trauma. “One of our goals was to bring this story to a western audience. It can function as a mirror for people. At the same time, it’s a story about Rwanda, and a complex process of reconciliation there. It’s not that everybody is reconciled now, and it was of interest [to us] to tell that.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Beginning around 2010, Blankevoort and Steketee started thinking about producing a more in-depth story using audio “because it’s about a radio show. Then we thought, if we’re going to do audio, we should do video, too. It became bigger and bigger, and we decided to do a Web documentary,” Steketee says.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The plan percolated over several years, a few visits to Rwanda, and meetings with <em>Musekeweya’s</em> creators and actors. The inspiration for the “Off Air” component of the project came from a <em>Musekeweya</em> fan who called the radio station to say life was imitating art in his own village. “They were friends with a neighboring village, then everything went wrong, and his village attacked the other village,” Steketee explains.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The man’s village eventually became one of the settings of the “Off Air” channel of the Love Radio project. “We went many times” to interview people and film scenes of daily life in the villages, Stekeete says. “To provide context for the [On Air] story about the radio soap, you have to show a little of the daily reality—a very personal story of this [radio caller] and his neighbors.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Realizing a Web-based multimedia project would require interactive design expertise, they teamed up with Sara Kolster, a designer and producer specializing in digital storytelling, and with <a href="http://www.kummer-herrman.nl/">Kummer &amp; Herrman</a>, an interactive design agency. Together, they began applying to foundations and agencies for production grants. “We wrote an extended application with technical details about the interface that was a book of its own—about 60 pages,” Steketee says.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Most of the filming for the project was done over a period of three weeks last year. “We worked with storyboards because we didn’t have much time. I was in my last trimester of pregnancy,” says the photographer. “We knew what we wanted to shoot, and who we wanted to interview.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>For the “Off Air” segments, she and Blakenvoort made a list of shots of daily life that they wanted to film. Those included landscapes, street scenes, domestic scenes and people gathered around their radios, plus behind-the-scenes shots of the <em>Musekeweya</em> actors re-creating an abridged version of the story for the Love Radio project. Steketee and Blankevoort used that footage as b-roll over interviews with village residents, and with some of the <em>Musekeweya</em> actors.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The challenge of <a href="http://www.loveradio-rwanda.org/episode/1/onair/introvideo">the “On Air” channel</a> was re-creating a 20-minute summary of a soap opera that had been airing for ten years. “There have been 30 different characters, all with complicated names, and many things have happened. We needed to bring the whole story back, and make it interesting to a western audience,” Steketee explains.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The narrative about two villages in conflict is interwoven with a story about two characters torn by their love for each other and their loyalty to their respective villages. “We picked out key scenes and key lines, and asked the actors to [dramatize] the lines again,” Steketee says. (They paid the actors their usual rates for the performances.)</div>
        <div>Post-production took several months. Blankevoort and Steketee transcribed all the interviews and logged all the video files, then sorted the material by topics, such as freedom of speech, radio culture, reconciliation, scapegoating and other themes.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Producer/designer Sara Kolster suggested organizing the fictional “On Air” layer as episodes to reflect the episodic structure of <em>Musekeweya</em>, and pair them with “Off Air” segments. “We had to bring in a cliffhanger in every episode, which is difficult because we’re not dramatists,” Steketee says. For help, they consulted a scriptwriter, who also advised them to use an English- speaking narrator to help move the story along and keep the attention of Western audiences.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Steketee and Blankevoort took pains to highlight universal themes to appeal to an international audience. They also worked to keep the project accessible. “It should be intelligent and layered, but not too arty-farty or complicated,” Steketee says. “You can lose the impact if you put [in] too much information.” Deciding what to include and exclude was a topic of constant discussion, she adds.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The Love Radio project debuted on April 7, 2014—the 20th anniversary of the outbreak of the Rwandan genocide. On a bi-weekly schedule over a period of 100 days, Love Radio creators posted the entire project in seven installments.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Since then, the challenge has been to build the audience, Steketee says. “Traffic to the website is OK, but it could have been more,” she says. She’s hoping exhibitions of the project will help drive more traffic. Besides the POPCAP exhibitions and the Foam exhibition (mounted after Blankevoort and Steketee showed the completed project to curators at Foam), Steketee says “We’re working on extending the list” of exhibition venues.</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>Since launching its Artist Initiative program last March, <a href="http://vsco.co/">Visual Supply Co (VSCO)</a> has awarded grants to support a variety of new projects by at least 14 artists, including nine photographers. The process is decidedly less-formal than that of most other photography grants. And so far, VSCO has awarded most of the grants to emerging photographers whose work straddles the boundary between documentary and fine-art photography.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><a href="http://www.joshwool.com/">Josh Wool</a>, who left a career as a chef about two years ago to pursue photography full- time, recently won a <a href="https://vsco.co/initiative">VSCO Artist Initiative grant</a> to use tintype methods to document artisan communities in New York’s Hudson Valley. VSCO also provided a grant to brothers Christopher and <a href="http://jonathanschoonover.com/">Jonathan Schoonover</a> for a project about the glitz and ritual of semi- professional wrestling.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Established in 2011, VSCO offers digital- imaging tools and services. To build a customer base, the company has a free app for shooting and editing images called <a href="http://vsco.co/vscocam">VSCO Cam</a>. VSCO Cam users can share their images on the <a href="http://grid.vsco.co/grid/1">VSCO Grid</a>, a curated social media site similar to Instagram, but with less clutter and noise.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Artist Initiative program is backed by a $1 million scholarship fund meant “to honor art and artists by discovering, funding, advising and promoting creatives from all corners of the globe.” It is also intended to drive business by encouraging use of the VSCO Cam and VSCO Grid: Only those artists with VSCO accounts who actively use the VSCO Grid are eligible for the grants. And while grant recipients retain copyrights to their work, they are required to use the VSCO grid to document progress on their projects, and allow VSCO to publish their images in books, exhibitions and VSCO’s blog, called VSCO Journal. Proceeds from any book or print sales are split with the photographers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Because VSCO is a private company managing its Artist Initiative program internally, the grant process isn’t transparent. Most of the AI program funding comes from <a href="http://www.accel.com/">Accel Partners</a>, a venture capital firm that invested $40 million in VSCO last spring for product development and marketing. An Accel executive declined on the company’s behalf to answer PDN’s questions about the grant program, pending “small updates” to the program.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But VSCO’s website indicates that applications for the AI grants are judged by a team of VSCO employees on the basis of four criteria: a project’s potential for positive social and artistic impact; how unique and interesting the proposed project is; the proposed budget; and “evidence of passion, initiative and creativity” in the application.</div>
<div>There are no deadlines. Applications, which must be submitted online, are accepted and judged on a rolling basis. And they may be approved and funded in a matter of weeks, rather than months.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Brothers Chris and Jon Schoonover approached VSCO for support for their project about semi-pro wrestling last winter, shortly before VSCO announced the Artist Initiative fund. “My brother and I were talking about how awesome the pageantry of wrestling was,” says Chris Schoonover. “Wrestling is just the flashiest thing I could think of. It’s so gaudy, it’s beautiful. There’s a lot of glitter, showmanship and pageantry that goes into it. It’s amazing to see.” They needed money to produce the project, and assistance promoting it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Chris Schoonover was a Web designer before he switched to photography about a year ago, and he met some VSCO staffers at the 100-50-1 charity exhibition of iPhone portraiture at the <a href="http://thenwblk.com/">NWBLK gallery in San Francisco</a> last November. Schoonover’s work was in the show; VSCO was one of the sponsors. So last January, Schoonover sent an email to his VSCO contacts describing the proposed project as a photojournalistic study. He explained that he and his brother would attend wrestling events and practices, create a large body of work and eventually turn it into a book and gallery show.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“I told them: We feel the project is going to be a hit, and we’d love to have VSCO be a part of it,” Schoonover says, adding that he asked for help editing and promoting the project, plus any other help that VSCO might be willing to offer as partners in a collaboration.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>VSCO contacted the Schoonovers in April, Schoonover recounts. After a series of phone meetings the company asked them to come up with a budget, itemizing what they needed. Within a month, they had the funds in hand.</div>
<div>Schoonover declined to say how much money they got, but says, “We really didn’t ask for much. We take pride in running a bare- bones operation. It makes you work harder.” They had planned to travel to wrestling venues all over the country, but decided there were enough venues close to home in southern New Jersey. So they asked for gas money, travel money to bring some of the wrestlers to a studio in New York for portrait sessions, plus money for equipment, including a camera and several <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/speedlite_flash_lineup/speedlite_600ex_rt">Canon 600EX-RT Speedlites.</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Meanwhile, photographer Josh Wool says he pitched projects on three different topics via VSCO’s online application: Hudson Valley artisan communities, commercial fishing in the Carolinas, and musicians trying to eke out a living on concert tours around the country. He wrote four or five paragraphs about each idea, explaining the story, what made it timely and compelling, and what he would photograph if given a grant.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For the farmer/artisan idea, he explained how he’d become friends with a couple who raised sheep and rabbits on a small farm in the Catskills. In addition to supplying restaurants in New York City (they’d been one of Wool’s suppliers in his previous career as a chef ), they raised their own food and made their own clothing, ran a recording studio on the side, and were part of a like-minded community of farmers and artists.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“The more I looked into it, the more I found little communities like that popping up around the Hudson Valley,” Wool told PDN in a phone interview.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A week or two after he submitted his application, VSCO called him. “They really liked the farmers and artisans idea,” he says. It felt unique, and it was manageable for a first project because of Wool’s proximity to the Hudson Valley. “They asked me to present a budget.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Wool’s proposed budget included line items for materials, including tintype plates. It also included travel costs: car rental, plus food and lodging for a month. In addition, Wool budgeted for two months’ worth of rent and living expenses in Brooklyn. “I took care of myself [in the proposed budget] for about a three-month period: a month to get ready, a month upstate, and a month for post-processing,” he says.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He submitted the budget on a Friday. By the following Tuesday, it was approved, and the grant money was in his account less than a week later. Wool finished shooting this summer, and is now working with VSCO to turn the project into a book, as well as an exhibition. “They’re going to pick up the production costs,” he says. Wool hopes to release the book in early December, in time for the holidays, and mount the exhibition by early 2015, provided he can find an exhibition space.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“I’m beyond grateful for having this [grant],” Wool says. “It was a great opportunity for me as an artist to really gain confidence, and to have somebody behind me who knows how to support [my project].”</div>
<div><br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div>Husband-and-wife team <a href="http://wearetherhoads.com/">We Are The Rhoads</a> began working with directors of photography when bigger brands with bigger budgets began calling on them for motion work. They wanted to take their directorial work, which they’ve done for clients such as <a href="http://vimeo.com/61743843">Sony</a>, Bose, Subaru, Dockers and <em><a href="http://www.kinfolk.com/california-dreaming/">Kinfolk</a></em>, to “the next level,” Sarah Rhoads says, and operating the camera “limits how much you can throw yourself into the act of developing the story, directing talent, thinking through camera moves, scenes and overall art direction.” Working with a DP freed them up.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Collaborating with DPs has also helped them learn about both technical and creative aspects of filmmaking. For Chris Rhoads, “learning how to communicate more effectively” has been key, something they’ve learned through working with different DPs. Photographers typically aren’t asked to convey their ideas so that someone else can execute them, he points out.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“The practice of describing what you want results in a better, more identified and understood concept/idea in the end,” he explains. “Sometimes I wish I went to school for creative writing, because I feel like the use of adjectives” is important in expressing nuance and mood.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Once they’ve communicated an idea or concept to a DP, the pair also has found it educational to see how a DP approaches a shot technically. “There are a million ways to light a scene to achieve the desired goal,” Sarah Rhoads explains. “Working with a DP and his team of gaffers and grips, you always see interesting and new ways to light a scene to achieve the desired look and feel.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>They admit it was initially challenging for them to give the camera to someone else. “There was an element of relinquishing a certain amount of control,” Sarah Rhoads notes. But because they are used to working with each other and have seen projects elevated creatively through their collaboration, they understand that working with others “can result in even better final products,” Chris Rhoads says.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Sarah Rhoads advises that choosing the right DP for a job is important to getting the most of the director/DP partnership. “DP’s come in all different shapes and sizes; they have all different specialties and working styles.” When the duo is working on video projects for editorial clients, they tend to work with DPs who come from documentary film backgrounds because they are more comfortable with a looser, more naturally lit production. For broadcast work, “that requires extensive storyboarding and preplanning, and working in a lot of different environments with unique lighting situations,” so the Rhoads like to work with DPs from the feature film and commercial worlds.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>DPs bring more than “a visual signature” to projects, Chris Rhoads adds. “Vibe and personality” are also important elements. They do best working with DPs who are “adaptable and flexible” when they want to try something that may veer from the storyboards on a project, and they also appreciate when a DP has his or her own opinions and ideas to contribute to the process, Chris Rhoads says.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The Rhoads met <a href="http://tombanksdp.com/">Tom Banks</a>, a DP they’ve collaborated with on several motion assignments— including a recent campaign for Bose electronics— when they were working alongside a film director on a commercial set a couple of years ago. Banks is “technically very savvy, has a youthful energy and effervescence to him, and is a great collaborator,” says Sarah Rhoads. They also like the crew of gaffers and grips Banks works with.</div>
        <div><br />
        Banks believes that a good director/DP partnership depends on the director’s ability to “balance knowing what they want with being open-minded and collaborative.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“I always find it valuable when a director can present specific references and annunciate details about what they are going for visually,” Banks says. With the Rhoads, he also values the fact that their collaboration has turned into a friendship. “Being able to work with talented people you can call your friends is really the holy grail of our jobs, so I’m really grateful to have the relationship.” </div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div>Mylio is a powerful new software tool that lets your photos do the talking. Simply stated, Mylio aims to solve the central dilemma facing photographers of all skill levels: how to find, organize and safeguard an ever-growing library of digital memories across all of our multiplying devices. From the professional photographer with a library of RAW files, to the casual snap-shooter hunting for an iPhone shot of the kids, Mylio’s software is intuitive and streamlined, allowing image-makers to focus on what truly matters: the photographs.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Joe McNally knows the value of photographic memories. In addition to his work as an acclaimed professional photographer, he’s a prolific speaker and educator within the photographic community. And like everyone else, he has personal memories to preserve alongside his professional output. For McNally, Mylio can help with both. When asked to select the most important image he’s taken in his storied career, he says, “I’ve photographed famous, beautiful people. Not to mention heads of state, movers and shakers and heroes of the athletic field. But none are as important to me as this one: my kid, trying to walk.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/mylio_advertorial_joe_mcnally(1).jpg" /><br />

        <div>Photo &copy; Joe McNally</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>
        <div>McNally’s daughter is now 28, and he says, “I’m very lucky to still have the negative. It is a piece of my memory that could have easily been lost.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Today, millions of photographers have—through no fault of their own—put their own digital negatives at risk; photos are sprinkled among external hard drives, laptops and mobile devices. Mylio offers a home with easy organization and an elegant interface. From a unified view of your entire image collection, you can tag, arrange and make edits that will instantly propagate across all of your devices. Mylio can also judge which photos are unprotected according to its 3:2 principle (an image is protected when there are three copies made in two separate locations). Armed with this knowledge, you can quickly identify which photos need a little extra security.</div>
        </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/All.jpg" /><br />
        </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>
        <div>For professional photographers, who require numerous backup copies, McNally says Mylio’s seamless approach across all registered devices is very appealing. For the rest of us, Mylio’s drive for elegance and simplicity will resonate.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>See Mylio for yourself at <a href="http://mylio.com/getmylio" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;">mylio.com/getmylio</a>, and if you're attending PhotoPlus Expo this week, stop by booth 273,</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>Notorious. Fabled. Legendary. Fearsome. Read any story about surfing the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii, and chances are one—or all—of those adjectives will make an appearance. Seven miles of white sand, world-class waves and generations of surfing mythology make it the sport’s undisputed Mecca.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Twenty-one-year-old surfer <a href="http://www.aspworldtour.com/athletes/199/john-john-florence">John John Florence</a> was born on Oahu and grew up on the North Shore, with the world’s most coveted swells breaking in his backyard. It was as if LeBron James had grown up across the street from Rucker Park, or the Williams sisters spent their childhoods on the grounds of Wimbledon. At the age of three he was riding his own board; by 13 he was competing professionally and being profiled in <em>The New York Times</em>; and at 19 he became the youngest surfer ever to win the <a href="http://vanstriplecrownofsurfing.com/vtcs14">Triple Crown</a>, the sport’s most prestigious competition.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Brooklyn-based photographer <a href="http://www.colebarash.com/">Cole Barash</a> grew up surfing New England’s rocky coastline from the age of nine, a world away from that Pacific Elysium. Nevertheless, by the time he was a teenager, the significance of Hawaii’s North Shore had “been pounded into [his] head.” So when Barash saw an opportunity to make his first trip to the North Shore and work with Florence, he seized it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“I wanted to shoot a project on the subculture of the North Shore, but I wanted to shoot it like it hadn’t been shot before,” explains the 27-year-old photographer. “So much high-level [surfing] action is shot there every year, and I wanted to turn 180 degrees from that and focus on what really makes North Shore what it is: the places and the people.” Barash self-published his book, <em>Talk Story</em>, and exhibited the work at Picture Farm Gallery in Brooklyn in July.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For Barash, the soft-spoken Florence would be the anchor of the work, an emotional center around which he could explore the insular beach community in all its roughly hewn beauty. Barash came up as a snowboarding photographer whose esthetic was partially defined by his documentation of the quieter moments during athletes’ travel and downtime. Shooting something more intimate than the typical surf porn that comes streaming out of Oahu would not be easy, though, as North Shore locals have a reputation for fiercely defending their turf from outsiders. Barash had never been there before and, as he puts it, it is “not a place that you can just show up and make demands.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But connections are everything, and Barash knew someone who was in the process of making a film about Florence. Through his friend, he floated some of his ideas for the book by the young Hawaiian and crossed his fingers. Florence’s response was an enthusiastic yes. “He is also into photography,” Barash says, noting that the young surfer’s appreciation for the art form was one reason he agreed to participate. “He has a darkroom. He’s been shooting for three or four years and actually has an eye.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Once on Oahu, Barash split his time between shadowing the Florence family—Florence has two brothers and was raised by a single mother—and going out on his own, looking for the things that the hordes of photographers on the island miss. He wanted to get photos of the locals others were either too ignorant to know about or too intimidated to approach, and to find a way to capture the more subtle beauty of a paradise that has been shot time and time again. He achieved the former by being “light on his feet,” respectful and unobtrusive. For the latter, he relied on instinct to bolster a stubborn determination not to settle for the obvious. While the hyper-masculine environment sometimes wore on him, Barash also came to understand the crucial role played by the community’s unwritten rules. “If not for the localism and Hawaiian pride, the North Shore would be filled with suburban development, with SUVs and mansions everywhere,” he says.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><em>Talk Story</em> was shot entirely on film, Barash’s medium of choice for his personal projects. “I mostly shoot on the [Mamiya 7 and Mamiya RZ 67], along with a couple point-and- shoots, because it’s a look I really like, and the depth of that Japanese glass is amazing. It’s the closest thing to a 4x5 without shooting 4x5,” he explains. “When I started shooting that camera four or five years ago, it really changed [my work]. The glass in the Mamiya is unlike any other medium format [camera].” Working exclusively with film also meant that Barash wasn’t able to see what he’d shot while he was on site, but he views that as a positive—being unable to preview his work helped him stay in the moment. In his mind, it’s all about “trusting your gut.” If he got home and felt he didn’t have the right images, he would have to go back.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When photographing Florence, Barash focused on everyday surroundings, domestic routines and family interaction. The result is a series of complex and compelling images of a manchild at play and at rest, contemplative portraits rich with texture and emotional resonance. These images simultaneously blend and clash with Barash’s vision of the environment itself: a shotgun marriage of rusting metal and marauding overgrowth, wide vistas and dirt roads. There is a rhythm to the work, the pulse of lives lived slowly, yet without reserve. A backyard littered with surfboards. Modest houses with their doors standing open. Pickup-truck beds, living- room couches and treehouses brimming with sun-soaked teenagers. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>From the beginning, Barash knew that he wanted to self-publish <em>Talk Story</em>. He didn’t want to compromise his vision of a highly personal work that would be meticulously designed. For assistance, he turned to graphic designer Tucker Phillips, whom he knew through a mutual interest in ’zines. Barash describes Phillips’ role as equal parts facilitator and devil’s advocate, saying their collaboration took the work to “another level.” Phillips admits that the project was a bit overwhelming at first, due to the sheer volume of quality images Barash had produced. While Barash edited and sequenced the photos, Phillips explored printing techniques and mocked up layouts. Eventually “we landed on a minimal design, mixed with unique printing techniques that would bring attention to the photos without overshadowing them,” Phillips recalls.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Although he is a successful commercial photographer, Barash makes it clear that his personal projects are paramount. Shooting something for himself (not an art director or client), the hunger to create something better than his last work, and his desire to leave his “stamp on the map” are what really drive him as an artist. Given that he calls surfing “my one outlet in life, something I have done since I was a grom and will do until I can’t breathe,” it is easy to understand why he wasn’t willing to put this project into a publisher’s hands. His love and passion for both his subject and medium is suffused into every part of this sublime book.</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>As the iPad has matured as a tool for photographers showing their images and videos in portfolio meetings, so have the portfolio apps. Where once there were hastily coded offerings short on features, we now have a thriving marketplace. For less than the price of a single pro-lab 8x10 for your print portfolio, you can have a powerful program at your fingertips that will allow you to present your work in any way that you wish.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here’s a round-up of some of the best portfolio apps available, ranging in price from $3 to $17. Most offer support for common image and video file formats. Each app highlighted here will present your images beautifully. Where they differ is in how files are loaded and synced to the iPad, which file types they support, how extensively they can be customized around your personal style and the amount of support offered by the developer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>Portfolio Pro for iPad</strong></div>
<div><strong><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/portfolio-pro-app.jpg" style="float: right;" /></strong></div>
<div>Slightly less-expensive than most of the other options here, Portfolio Pro for iPad is nonetheless a full-featured portfolio app.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Importing can be done from your iPad’s photo albums, Flickr or Dropbox. Portfolio Pro can also import directly from your Flickr Photostream and Flickr Sets and will even preserve your photos’ titles and descriptions. Using Dropbox, you can export and clone to multiple iPads. But unlike with some of the other apps, there is no automatic sync capability for Dropbox, so any changes to the master must be manually exported and imported to the other iPads. Portfolio Pro offers enough branding and design customization options to match your portfolio to your style, but not so many that it becomes complicated and confusing. Inserting your logo, choosing a start screen image, and changing color schemes are all quick and easy. One particularly useful feature is the app’s ability to easily hide galleries from view. You can have multiple portfolios for multiple purposes, and quickly choose which you want to show or hide. The developer has an active Twitter account, a Facebook page and a specific support-ticket area on their website.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>PRICE: </strong>$9.99</div>

<strong>Portfolio for iPad</strong>
<div><strong><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/portfolio-for-ipad(3).jpg" style="float: right;" /></strong>
<div>Portfolio for iPad has been a strong contender in the arena of photo-portfolio apps for several years, and the app’s developers have regularly released updates.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Aimed at working photographers, Portfolio allows for a significant amount of customization, as far as presentation and branding is concerned. You can upload images from your iPad’s photo albums, iTunes, Dropbox, Box, a URL or via the Mac Loader app. Portfolio can handle any image, video, or PDF file that the iPad supports. The iPad app is divided into three main sections: the manager (for gallery creation and content importing/organizing), the appearance customizer (where the interface colors, themes and behaviors are edited), and the viewer (where all content playback and browsing is done). A backup feature allows you to create different configurations for your portfolio or clone the same configuration to multiple iPads. The developer has an extensive user guide on its website and a support email address.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>PRICE:</strong> $12.99 </div>
<div><strong>INFO:</strong> <a href="http://ipadportfolioapp.com/">ipadportfolioapp.com</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>Xtrafolio<img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/xtrafolio-1(1).jpg" style="float: right;" /></strong></div>
<div>The priciest of the apps listed here, Xtrafolio offers an extensive feature set. Importing is done via iTunes, Dropbox or the iPad’s photo library. All iPad-supported image, video and PDF files can be displayed. As part of the integration with Dropbox, you have the ability to make one iPad the “master” and then create multiple “slave” iPads that are clones. Any changes to the master portfolio will automatically populate on the slave iPads—a useful feature for bridal shows or busy portrait studios. Conveniently, Xtrafolio lets you create an unlimited number of folders and add unlimited images to each folder. It also supports nesting for folders within folders, giving you a significant number of organizational options and making it more practical to have a large portfolio.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Xtrafolio has a modern, stylish design that should serve any working pro well. Fonts, colors, layouts and backgrounds can all be adjusted. The customizable splash screen, logo, and text options help with branding. One particularly nice feature is the ability to have a watermark automatically added to your image if anyone wishes to email it from the app. The in-app help feature is not as thorough as it should be (and requires an Internet connection), but the developer has a more extensive user guide online, as well as Facebook, Twitter and email contact options.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>PRICE:</strong> $16.99</div>
<div><strong>INFO:</strong> <a href="http://xtrafolio.com/">xtrafolio.com</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>Foliobook</strong></div>
<div><strong><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/foliobook(2).jpg" style="float: right;" /></strong></div>
<div>While creating Foliobook, the app’s creators worked with professional commercial photographers to great effect—it’s easily one of the most popular portfolio apps. But perhaps more importantly, they seem to have done a good job of listening to their customers; since Foliobook’s initial release, they have pushed regular updates and added features.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Foliobook offers extensive customization and styling options; when an app lets you change the color of the control buttons, you know it’s serious about customization. Branding options also abound; you can use a still image or video as the splash screen and overlay your logo on top of it. In fact, setting up Foliobook is a bit like building a Web page. You can even link videos from menu items rather than just placing them in a gallery, a nice touch for wedding studios that offer both photo and video packages. But keep in mind that using video on Foliobook requires a plugin ($1.99 in-app purchase). Foliobook can access your photo library or import via Dropbox. It can also import via your PhotoShelter account, a unique feature among its peers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It may have a steeper learning curve than many of the other apps, but Foliobook also has extensive support options. With a large user guide, a community discussion forum, a help-desk ticket system, Twitter, Facebook and email, you won’t be at a loss for assistance.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>PRICE:</strong> $12.99 </div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>Minimal Folio</strong></div>
<div><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/minimal-folio.jpg" style="float: right;" /></div>
<div>Many of the apps in this list are quite fancy, with as many integrations and customizations as one could need. But sometimes photographers just need a simple app to show off their work. Minimal Folio is that app.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When you first open the app, a quick tutorial guides you through the setup process and images are organized on a grid. You use columns to group related images, then move through that group with an up/ down swipe. Left/right swipes move you between columns and thus through your different groupings. You can copy from your camera albums, import from iTunes or sync to a Dropbox account. Minimal Folio can display iPad-supported images, videos and PDFs, and reordering images is as simple as a drag-and-drop. While there is no splash-screen branding, the app loads quickly and always takes you to the first image of your project, so it can pull double-duty as a title or branding slide. The in-app help feature is useful, and the developer has Facebook and email contact info available on their website.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>PRICE: </strong>$2.99</div>

</div>
<div><strong>Padfolios </strong></div>
<div><strong><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/Padfolios-iPad(1).jpg" style="float: right;" /></strong></div>
<div>Creator Juan Pablo Mazuera, a Colombian photographer, showcases his knack for design and app development in his portfolio app Padfolios. An avowed Apple fan, he was one of the first people in Colombia to get his hands on an iPad back in 2010. But as a photographer and designer, he was disappointed in the tools he had available to use his iPad as a digital portfolio, so he set about creating Padfolios.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Importing is done exclusively through the iPad’s photo library. Padfolio’s layout is not extensively customizable, but looks clean and professional without being excessively minimal. Backgrounds and text allow for branding and personalizing, and text and line colors are infinitely adjustable through the use of RGB sliders—a nice touch. It’s convenient that Padfolios saves your changes automatically, as it can be frustrating to be forced to click “save” after every adjustment. Padfolios is designed to showcase images only, which can be a drawback if you have videos to display. On the flipside, Padfolios is a universal app that will run on both the iPad and the iPhone/iPod Touch. The app’s help file is simple but covers all of the basics, and Mazuera has Twitter, Facebook and email contact options on his website for additional help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>PRICE:</strong> $14.99</div>
<div><strong>INFO: </strong><a href="http://padfolios.me/home.html">padfolios.me/home.html</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>Mediapad Pro</strong></div>
<div><strong><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/mediapad-pro.jpg" style="float: right;" /></strong></div>
<div>Mediapad Pro’s strengths include its simplicity and the ability to handle multimedia files. Images, video, audio, HTML and more are supported, and the app may just have the simplest adjustment tools for a slideshow function. Photos are imported through iTunes or from your iPad’s photo library. A custom homepage banner, portfolio banners and custom backgrounds are also supported. Aside from that, only minor color and font theme changes are customizable. The app’s developers have a handy introduction video that quickly runs through the basics of using Mediapad Pro, but it’s hosted on YouTube and thus unavailable offline from within the app. Mediapad Pro is still a very handy budget option for those who want a basic portfolio app for different types of media, but caveat emptor—there doesn’t appear to be an active support site, or any contact info for the developers.</div>
<div><br />

<div><strong>PRICE:</strong> $6.99 </div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div>Whether shooting editorial portraiture, chronicling a critical social issue, or reporting a news story, one of the biggest challenges a photographer can face is to make a compelling photograph of a subject that is not inherently visually interesting. Finding creative ways to do just that is key for the freelance photographers working for <em><a href="http://chronicle.com/section/Home/5">The Chronicle</a> </em><a href="http://chronicle.com/section/Home/5">of</a> <em><a href="http://chronicle.com/section/Home/5">Higher Education</a></em>, a Washington, DC-based publication that prints news, job opportunities and opinion pieces for people working in academia. A physicist winning an award or a group of students in a university classroom are not necessarily the sexiest subjects, but the photographers who work for <em>The Chronicle</em> have to make compelling images each week by thinking creatively and being quick on their feet. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Photo editor <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Rose-Engelland/134204/">Rose Engelland</a> and assistant photo editor <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Erica-Lusk/134278/">Erica Lusk</a> hire more than 20 photographers each month from their evolving database of over 1,000 international freelancers. “We look for photographers who take something that would be ordinary and run with it,” explains Lusk. “We assign a lot of what would seem like uninteresting shots on the surface, but can be taken up a notch by the right photographer.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The topics <em>The Chronicle</em> covers range widely, from student protests, to regulations that allow the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to enforce concussion prevention guidelines in college sports, to interviews with the likes of Bill Gates, who discussed his views on education. Because <em>The Chronicle </em>doesn’t have a budget for travel expenses, they hire photographers based in whatever location they’re covering—whether that be Toronto or Dubai. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>As a result, Engelland and Lusk are able to work with a wide variety of photographers and can handpick talent according to what they are envisioning for any given story. They haven’t always met the photographers they work with and have to rely on what they see on websites and in portfolios to decide if a photographer is a good fit for a job. “I’m very sensitive to the way a website is organized,” says Engelland. While she enjoys looking at fine-art projects, what she is really looking for is a shooter’s commissioned work—editorials and documentary photographs, for example. “They might have a very funky approach to shooting a dozen eggs, but I need to know that if they meet a scientist, they can bring his research alive in an image,” she explains. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><em>The Chronicle</em> updates daily online and receives more than 1.9 million unique visits per month. The print publication goes out to more than 64,000 subscribers every week. Although the publication covers international stories like the influx of Chinese students into American universities, or the psychology of violence in regions such as Bosnia, most of its readership is based in the United States or Canada. </div>
        <div>
        <p>Lusk and Engelland both tackle different sections. Engelland, who has been at <em>The Chronicle</em> for more than 30 years, takes care of the international assignments—for these stories, she usually hires one photographer a week—as well as all of the images in <em>The Chronicle Review</em>, a weekly magazine insert that includes opinion pieces and stories about art, culture and literature. “Some of the opinion pieces can get really heady,” Engelland says. Her job is to humanize the stories, no matter how intellectual they are, by providing images that the reader can connect to. She typically commissions a cover story and the occasional portfolio inside the magazine. Roughly 60 percent of the images she uses are stock photographs, with the other 40 percent assigned to photographers or photo illustrators.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <p>Lusk, who came to <em>The Chronicle</em> six years ago from <em>The Washington Post</em>, hires at a much more robust pace for the newspaper and for the website. Generally, she commissions stories from five to seven shooters per week during the school year. Those jobs vary from portraits to photo essays to documentary images. Engelland says <em>The Chronicle</em> pays a competitive day rate and covers local transportation and expenses.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <p>When Lusk is talking with photographers with whom she hasn’t previously worked, she usually asks see an un-edited shoot, in addition to their standard portfolio, to get a sense of how they’re seeing on an assignment. “It’s not always well-received,” she laughs.</p>
        </div>
        <div>In the past 18 months, Lusk and Engelland have ventured into commissioning video stories around topics such as untenured adjunct professors; a college president who was recently tasked with the burden of selling his institution; and how the 9/11 attacks influenced higher education. The 9/11 video profiled professionals and students involved in the aftermath of the attacks. It included Alexis Glenn, now a photographer at George Mason University, who was in her second day of photojournalism classes when she photographed the burning Pentagon, and Chaplain Sanaa Nadim, a counselor of the Muslim community at the State University of New York, Stony Brook. The assignment went to <a href="http://www.markabramsonphoto.com/">Mark Abramson</a>, a New York-based multimedia journalist and photographer originally from Russia who produces, on average, two stories a month for <em>The Chronicle</em>. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Abramson says that <em>The Chronicle</em> is his favorite client to work with and that Lusk is always open to creative ideas. “She doesn’t hire freelancers because they know how to shoot a photograph—she hires them for their eyes,” he explains. “She loves seeing an edit with quirky compositions.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Initiative is also important. Both Abramson and <a href="http://www.mattrothphoto.com/#!/index">Matt Roth</a>, a Baltimore-based photographer who has contributed to <em>The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, AARP</em> and <em>USA Today</em>, travelled to <em>The Chronicle’s</em> D.C. offices to meet with Engelland and Lusk. “I’m sort of old-school in the sense that it helps a lot if a photographer meets us in person,” confesses Engelland. “I like to get a sense of how nimble they are, and how they think.” Neither editor is partial to any particular medium for viewing a portfolio—they’ve seen them on iPads, laptops and multimedia presentations, as well as in print. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Both editors were impressed with Roth, because they could immediately tell he was not a rote thinker. They have since hired him to shoot a number of essays for them, including a moving piece on Ron Shriver, a retired marine staff sergeant who is the first in his family to attend college, thanks to the new G.I. Bill. “With <em>The Chronicle</em>, I feel like I have a lot of freedom to be creative,” explains Roth, who ended up capturing Shriver not only as a student and former soldier, but also as an attentive and loving father. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><em>The Chronicle </em>encourages photographers to run with their assignments. For example, Abramson was assigned by Lusk to photograph Occupy Wall Street protests at Baruch College, but found himself in the middle of a skirmish when campus police beat up a group of students. “I was in contact with Erica the whole time, getting feedback,” he says. “She gave me the bread and butter, and then she allowed me to go play.” Lusk ended up running a full spread of his images in <em>Section A</em>. “[Lusk and Engelland] are just open to ideas,” Abramson elaborates. “They want me to shoot a scene how I see it—not how it’s supposed to be.” </div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div><a href="http://www.ryanschude.com/">Ryan Schude</a> started making portraits of people with their vintage cars as a way to take a break from his signature high production value work. As a result, he’s been able to tap into the car photography market, bidding on and landing commercial jobs, and he’s also received a ton of press for the series, titled “<a href="http://potd.pdnonline.com/2014/08/27991">Them and Theirs</a>.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The Los Angeles-based photographer is best known for his elaborately lit cinematic tableaux, which frequently involve large groups of models. “Them and Theirs” gave him a chance to work on a simpler documentary-style project that also incorporates some of his production know-how. Many of the portraits are straightforward, but if his subjects are willing, he’ll work with them on more stylized “wacky concepts.” “I’m not good in the streets at approaching strangers, so it gave me access into a more documentary world. But I could take my time with it and still work with the subjects to really plan an elaborate shot,” Schude explains.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>A recent image shot from above shows an owner lying on top of her powder blue 1963 Ford Falcon. In another shot of production designer Adi Goodrich with her 1988 Chevy Cavalier wagon, Goodrich stands on the hood and roof of the car, while huge ribbons of red fabric flow through the scene.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Schude began the series after he moved to LA, which is famous for its car culture. He photographed friends with their cars, and eventually the series grew to the point that he was getting referrals and requests from people who wanted to participate. He also leaves postcards with an image from the series on the windshields of cars he’d like to photograph, with a note to the owner about the project and his contact info. Schude says he has a lengthy list of people to shoot. “I’ve been doing at least one or two a month when I have time away from work,” he says.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>While he didn’t start the series thinking it could land him ad assignments involving cars, it didn’t take long for him to realize there was a commercial application for the work. First Wieden + Kennedy in New York called, asking to see his car photographs, and then he published one of the images in <em>Angeleno</em> magazine. He bid on Toyota jobs through Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, and then <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/behold/2014/04/21/ryan_schude_them_and_theirs_is_a_series_about_people_with_their_cars_in.html">Slate published an article about his series</a>, leading to a number of online and print publications picking it up. The images, which he’s promoted primarily through social media and email, have also won recognition from PX3 and the World Photography Awards.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“It’s now so obvious [to me] that there’s an application [for] it commercially,” Schude says, noting that the car industry is using more and more lifestyle work.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>One of the biggest commercial jobs to result from the work wasn’t for a car company, but it did require that he photograph a car. For an ad for Samsonite, commissioned by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in Belgium, Schude photographed a couple on the road in a vintage Porsche with a suitcase that has broken away from the luggage rack, smashing into the foreground.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Schude has also shot smaller social-media jobs for Volkswagen and Honda through Edelman in New York, and has offered to shoot portraits in the vein of the series on spec for agencies with car clients. “Creatives want to do something like this because it’s relatable” and different from standard car work, Schude posits. He’s even had one creative director ask to be photographed with his own car for the series.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>As he continues the work, Schude wants to include owners of modern cars in the series, “and find a way to still make it look cool and fun,” he says. One of his favorite shots was of a friend and his Prius, which Schude made on spec when he was bidding on a job for Toyota.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“Everyone knows someone who has a [cool] car, or they have one and they want to be shot,” Schude says of the interest in the series. “It’s funny how they get excited about it. It makes sense, if they are going to spend this amount of time and effort [maintaining] a classic car, they probably want to be shot with it.”</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>A year and a half ago, <a href="http://www.sashagulish.com/">Sasha Gulish</a> was shooting a few different things: travel, food and portraits. Relying on repeat business and word of mouth, the San Francisco-based photographer was busy with editorial assignments and pharmaceutical advertising, but she felt her work was unfocused. Friends would tell her she should be trying to land ad assignments with higher profiles, but she didn’t know how. When she decided to treat herself to a photo workshop taught by <a href="http://www.clmus.com/photography/norman-jean-roy">Norman Jean Roy</a> at the <a href="http://www.santafeworkshops.com/">Santa Fe Workshops</a>, she had an epiphany. Before the workshop, Roy asked participants to fill out a detailed questionnaire that included a question about their goals for the future. Gulish recalls thinking, “I don’t want to have any regrets.” If she wanted to change her career, she decided, “I don’t want to look back and say I didn’t try.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So the photographer asked her friends for help. Nick Onken and Sarah Rhoads of the photography duo <a href="http://wearetherhoads.com/">We Are The Rhoads</a> recommended consultants <a href="http://www.sosastone.com/index.php?/consulting/">Amanda Sosa Stone</a> and <a href="http://suzannesease.com/">Suzanne Sease</a>. Stone and Sease agreed to work with her, and Gulish sent them “thousands of images” that she considered to be her best work, including personal and assignment work of every type. The consultants selected a few that stood out, images that Gulish had shot in her spare time. They showed her son—not yet two years old when she first began working with Stone and Sease—and family and friends in unguarded candid moments. The selections formed the seed of a portfolio she could pitch to advertising clients looking for authentic lifestyle imagery.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“It was cohesive as a body of work,” Gulish says, but she had overlooked it among all the images she was shooting at the time. “I feel like sometimes we obsess and get stuck editing our own images. It was nice to let go and have someone with fresh eyes tell me what they see in my work.” Gulish, who studied photography at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, CA, realized in hindsight that for too long she thought that when making work for herself, she should shoot images that seemed serious or artful. “I realized I enjoyed photographing the joyful, happy moments because they’re beautiful. There’s nothing not arty about that.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Gulish and the consultants agreed there were holes in her portfolio that she needed to fill. To get more photos of older kids, teens and a wider mix of families, she set up test shots with friends, cousins and models she found through modeling agencies or Craiglist. Once she had demonstrated a knack for putting first-time models and kids at ease, agencies were happy to work with her to produce images for the models’ books and her own. When she shoots personal work, Gulish often takes inspiration from her own family life. One image she calls “Stinky Baby” shows a friend—childless in real life—posing with a diapered baby held at arm’s length, recoiling from the scent of the diaper. She made the image into a postcard she uses as a leave-behind when she meets with creatives.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>She completed the overhaul of her website in 2012 and signed with rep <a href="http://www.kimknightrepresents.com/">Kim Knight</a> that September. By December she was getting requests to bid on lifestyle ad assignments, and by February 2013 she had shot ads for Coors Light, Similac and PediaSure while she was pregnant with her second child.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Shooting images she loves has made self-promotion a pleasure rather than a chore. She faithfully emails new work to clients every six to eight weeks; after she photographed her baby and four-year-old destroying her home office, for example, she turned the image into an email promo she sent to clients at tax time. “I’m not doing it because I think, ‘uh-oh, I need to send out a postcard,’ I’m thinking, ‘oh, this is hilarious.’” The images she shares on her <a href="http://instagram.com/sashagulish">Instagram</a> and <a href="http://sashagulish.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> are now focused on moments from her life.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When bidding on a job, she pulls images from her archive or shoots new tests to show the style and approach she would take. She sends these to clients in PDFs, adding a letter explaining what she likes about the campaign and how she plans to bring it to life. She also tries to set up meetings with creatives whenever possible. “I think it’s important to meet creative and art buyers in person. People like to work with people they are comfortable with.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On creative calls, she regularly hears, “We love the realness of your photos.” Her constant testing has taught her to get believable moments fast, even within the artifice of commercial shoots. When Barilla recently hired her to shoot ads for their protein pasta, she had only a short time to photograph a restless kid for one shot. In another she had to capture a relaxed family dinner— with a group of models who had never met before. “In order to capture real moments, I have models get to know each other on set so the real moments can happen while I’m shooting,” she says. “Otherwise, it would feel staged and inauthentic.” On the Barilla shoot, she got the models laughing and talking.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Though the commercial assignments have been coming in at a steady clip, she always makes time to shoot personal work. “I was working nonstop for about six weeks. I told my rep I need to be home for about a week, because that inspires me,” she says. “Going to the grocery store, potty training, being sleep-deprived. No matter how busy I am, I always need to be photographing those times.”</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div>Last spring, corporate portrait photographer <a href="http://www.davidyellen.com/#!/index">David Yellen</a> was so eager to change direction, he says, “that I wished I could have changed my name, because when people think of ‘David Yellen,’ they think of old white guys on gray seamless, and I was like, ‘Oh, God. I’m 41. I’m too young to be that guy.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>He didn’t change his name, but he’s on the road to re-making his career. He is using personal work to show clients the kinds of portrait assignments he wants to shoot, and to show off his new minimalist lighting style. It’s beginning to pay off. Recent assignments include photographing a shark-fishing tournament for <em>Field &amp; Stream</em>; portraits of lobster fishermen (and women) for <em>Downeast</em> magazine; and portraits of a stunt woman for <em>Ink </em>magazine.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“I want my photography to be an adventure,” says Yellen. “I want to experience something, I want to meet people I wouldn’t have met.” Rather than photograph executives in offices, he says, “I’d much rather be on a wharf with an old crusty guy telling me about how he used to make boats, or in the woods hunting something.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Yellen’s enviable success as a corporate photographer has made re-branding himself difficult. His career “went from 0 to 100” when he quit assisting in 2001. He was soon shooting for <em>SPIN, ESPN, New York</em> and others. Photo editors took him from one publication to the next as they changed jobs; he eventually found himself shooting for <em>Forbes</em> and <em>Fortune</em>.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>By 2011, though, the excitement was gone, and he was no longer enjoying it as much. But with a family to support, “I had to keep going,” he says.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Looking back, Yellen says his problem with corporate work was that he’d simply fallen into it. “I wasn’t specific about what I wanted to shoot,” he says. “But eventually I wanted to shoot stuff that I was more interested in.”</div>
        <div>About three years ago, his wife got a job, which “gave me room to breathe,” he says. He started taking risks on assignments, shooting subjects the way he wanted to, in addition to shooting them the way clients wanted. His lighting style, he explains, “got too complicated over the years,” giving his pictures a surreal look. He continued to shoot assignments that way, but also made shots of his subjects using just one strobe and available light.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>To Yellen’s surprise, 90 percent of the time his clients chose the simpler images, and he started getting even more work.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Around that time, while shooting corporate portraits for Discovery Channel, he showed the client pictures from a tuna fishing trip he’d been on. “Within two weeks they called me to a shoot a poster for a fishing show. That put me on the road to: This is what I want to do.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Yellen knew he’d have to start shooting personal work to show clients the kinds of subjects he was interested in shooting. But he hadn’t shot any personal projects in years, and the voices of self- doubt—“Maybe your vision is not good, maybe it’s going to suck”— paralyzed him for two years.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Last year, he decided to take a leap. He had kept a notebook of project ideas; one was to photograph a demolition derby. “I said, ‘OK, I’m going to do this. And I loved the way the pictures turned out,” he recounts, explaining that he shot portraits of drivers with their cars in addition to documentary images.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Then he moved on to other projects on his list. Last summer, he and his wife rented a farm in Sweden for a few weeks, inviting friends to tag along. He would shoot portraits after dinner every night at sunset with a single studio light, he says, posting the pictures on Instagram. Before he’d returned from Sweden, he was getting calls for assignments. “I thought, OK, I’m onto something here.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Yellen then set about rebuilding his online portfolio. Jennifer Kilberg, a photography consultant and a friend of Yellen’s, helped him edit his personal work. He ditched his old website, which was too slow and difficult to update, and put his new portfolio on Photoshelter in January. He’s also posted new personal work on <a href="http://davidyellen.tumblr.com/">his Tumblr,</a> and continues to update his portfolio with new images.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>To get word out to clients, Yellen is mailing postcards and sending bi-monthly email promos through <a href="http://www.agencyaccess.com/">Agency Access</a>. “For the first one I went really wide to see who was interested and who opted out, then I refined it.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Clients are calling now, but Yellen was initially discouraged when the first promo landed “like a thud.” But he also tries to get meetings with every client who clicks through the email promo to his website. After each meeting, he leaves behind a 30-page Blurb book of his images.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Yellen continues to shoot corporate portrait assignments, and says he’ll never shut the door on that work. He just hopes to reduce them to about 15 percent of his business, “and make the rest interesting environmental portraits.”</div>
        <div>Reflecting on how difficult it was to get the courage to change direction, Yellen says, “Changing your style is like going to rehab. You have to be ready for it. You have to wear the other [old style] out hard.”</div>
        <div><br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div>You’ve wrapped principal photography on your video. Now it all comes down to the edit; assembling all the pieces to make a compelling, cinematic narrative.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Many photographers who have moved into motion work say that they learned the most about how to shoot video while trying to edit their own work, or by working closely with video editors. Their feedback on technical mistakes, the types of footage they were missing and how to best to organize their clips can be crucial to understanding how to approach a video project.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>We asked some experienced editors to provide insights into their work and some advice for new directors.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>PROVIDE ENOUGH COVERAGE, AND A VARIETY OF IT.</strong></div>
        <div>For photographers used to capturing decisive moments, the biggest adjustment when shooting video is learning what to shoot; the goal is to provide the editor with the footage they need to weave together multiple clips with smooth transitions. Photographers used to looking only for the best compositions need to learn how to shoot the same scene in many ways while keeping the look consistent.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“I like working with photographer/directors,” says Raphael Rice, who edited <em><a href="http://www.worldvision.org/worldvision/pr.nsf/stable/eNews_pr_091803">Seeds of Hope</a></em>, a documentary for the non-profit World Vision directed by photographer-turned-director <a href="http://www.joshrothstein.com/">Josh Victor Rothstein</a>. “They have a good eye, and as an editor it makes my job easier to work with good shooters because the footage is more likely to be usable. But it’s not automatic.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Some photographers may not be used to finding and making use of multiple angles. Rice says, “A good shooter can make it seem like there were two cameras in the room by shooting from two different angles. In order to do that, they have to understand how angles work narratively, how close or how far they have to be, so as to feel like it is still the same scene even though the two shots are from different moments.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>As an example, Rice notes, “After the main conversation is captured, if I get some coverage of a conversation from an angle where I don’t see the subject’s lips moving, that will be very useful as a cutaway.” A cutaway—footage inserted into the flow of continuous action—can be used to avoid abrupt jumps by the subject. <em>Seeds of Hope</em>, for example, features an interview with actor and World Vision spokesperson Hugh Jackman, shot with the camera placed close to the subject and then further away, on a different angle. Rice pieced together footage from each angle seamlessly, intercutting footage of Jackman on his way to testify at the United Nations.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>He adds, “The director has to have a sense that they have gotten enough... synced conversation, and while that conversation is still going on, at risk of not capturing the subject’s face when something important is said, they will move to a new angle and get some good cutaways. The shooter has to be thinking on many levels to pull that off.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>GET THE BEST AUDIO YOU CAN.</strong></div>
        <div>“Focus on getting clean sound, because that will make a bad film seem better,” Rice says. Checking sound quality and audio levels while also shooting and directing is difficult, so many editors recommended working with a good crew that includes an audio engineer.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>To get high-quality sound, directors and their crew typically choose to use an external recording device rather than record sound directly to the camera. That creates an additional problem: syncing audio with visuals. “I’ve actually been handed a lot of footage that is not slated. Getting raw footage and un-slated audio files is my worst nightmare,” says Stephen Venezia, a director and editor at <a href="http://nimblefoxproductions.com/">Nimblefox Productions</a>. Venezia, who has worked on <a href="http://">music videos for Paramore (directed by Sophia Peer)</a> and Girl Talk (directed by Allen Cordell), says, “Sometimes I’ll have to sit down with five hours of talking heads and have no idea which audio files belong to which video files.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>When recording interviews, Venezia recommends noting the take and subject, and always using a clapboard. If you’re not using an electronic clapboard or slating app, write down the timecode on your digital recording device, or call out the take and subject at the start of the recording. If you’re paying an editor by the hour, syncing the audio saves money.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>DIRECT FOR ACTION, NOT COMPOSITION.</strong></div>
        <div>“Sometimes when I get footage from a photographer moving into video, I tend to notice that the model—or whoever they’re shooting—might be a little more rigid,” says Venezia. It’s a problem an editor can’t fix. Learning to direct subjects with an eye for body language and emotion takes practice; good video casting also helps. Before attempting to work with actors, he says, “I think people need to understand how to direct for video as opposed to just for photos.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>DON’T LOSE SIGHT OF THE STORY YOU’RE TELLING.</strong></div>
        <div>There’s a lot to remember when shooting multiple takes from multiple angles. The goal, however, is not so different than when shooting stills: to communicate a story. <a href="http://stephenmlinarcik.com/">Stephen Mlinarek</a>, who edited <a href="http://vimeo.com/92009858">a video for 2b bebe (directed by fashion photographer Brooke Nipar)</a>, says photographers already know how to capture mood, tell a story, and communicate a client’s message. “Making the leap from one medium to the other, it’s easy to forget that your goals are the same when caught up in how simultaneously exciting and difficult the prospects of film production are,” he says. His advice: “Remember what you’re trying to say.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Venezia observes, “I think that people who might be unfamiliar with video tend to shoot a lot of content and then just hand it to an editor and say, ‘Assemble this.’” Directors need to pre-visualize all the material they want. Storyboards can guide the shoot; they’re also useful when it’s time to explain the story to the editor. Venezia recommends designating a note-taker during shoots, marking which takes worked and which ones had technical problems or audio flubs.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO DO THE JOB.</strong></div>
        <div>“There’s an expectation some newbies have about what can be achieved that isn’t realistic within their content, budget or timeline,” says Mlinarczik. He advises directors, “It’s far more beneficial to ask me what’s possible instead of telling me what you think I should be able to do within a given period of time.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Depending on the video format you choose and the editor’s software, the editor may need to convert or transcode the video files. In planning a budget and schedule for a job, Rice says, “I like to build in a tech day” devoted simply to organizing and prepping all the files.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The most time-consuming part of an editor’s job is reviewing all the footage. “More footage is more time. It doesn’t matter if you want a 30-second piece; if you hand me ten hours of footage, it’s going to be a long edit,” Rice says.</div>
        <div>He adds, “The more you can do to be organized—narratively, technically—the happier I am.”</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div><a href="http://www.jameswojcik.com/">James Wojcik</a> has almost as much acclaim for the promotional mailers he’s created during his 30-plus-year career as he has for the still lifes he shoots for <em>Vogue</em> Brazil, Target, Nike, H. Stern, Bacardi, <em>Town &amp; Country</em>, <em>Departures </em>and other editorial and commercial clients. He’s crafted posters, booklets and decks of cards, but each has shared a different project that he’s thrown himself into with enthusiasm. Says Wojcik: “To feel good about yourself as a photographer, you have to make work you care about.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He doesn’t plan the promotions as a way to land specific types of work, he says. Photographers need different promotions at different times of their careers. If you “want to make a splash,” he says, send an email blast or mail a poster. For Wojcik however, crafting printed promotions is a means of “creating something with my hands” and showing work that reflects his passions. “I want to create a series of photographs that...I can look at 5, 10, 15 years later in my life,” he says. It’s not a marketing strategy he recommends to every photographer, “but for me, it’s a natural path,” he says. “I’m trying to get attention, but I also want to represent who I am as a photographer.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The impact his personal series have on potential clients is hard to quantify, he says, but he knows that they’re memorable. Three years ago, a creative director Wojcik was working with complimented him on his deck of cards that showed images of alphabet shapes he had sculpted out of cardboard and simple objects. Wojcik had mailed the promotion in 1990. Clients still talk about the booklet he made four years ago from his Wo-Brands series: garishly lit images showing packaging of well known American brands (Hawaiian Punch, Lucky Strike, Budweiser) with logos he had remade, inserting the first syllable of his last name. The promos he likes have “a little reality, a fantasy or alternative world, [or] humor,” he says. “To me, it’s everlasting if you can touch on many emotions.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>His newest promotional effort “represents all that I’ve been trying to do with promos.” It centers on Wojcik’s latest obsession: the oysters he’s raised near his vacation home on Shelter Island, New York. Some of the hundreds of images he’s shot of oysters—shucked, unshucked, cooked and plated or fashioned into sculptures with plastic eyes on them—are hosted on a website he made for the fictional Dinah Rock Oysters Company. He’s also turned 50 of the images into a boxed set of postcards.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Wojcik began raising oysters four years ago after completing a course at the <a href="http://ccesuffolk.org/spat/">Suffolk County Project in Aquaculture Training</a> in Southold, New York. “I wasn’t going to photograph them. I grew them because they’re fun,” he says. But his fascination inspired him to look at them photographically. “Then I realized these things are kind of ugly,” Wojcik says. He liked the challenge of making compelling images from something that “looks like a rock.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After harvesting some oysters, he would spread them out on a sheet on the dock, or bring them into his studios on Shelter Island and in Manhattan to photograph them in a variety of ways, against different backdrops. “I think you want to keep going back to shooting things over and over again so you can find subtle differences or layers,” he says.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>(Wojcik ate his subjects. “After an hour of shooting, I’d have maybe 40 oysters on ice and then usually fry them up.”)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After two years, Wojcik had shot hundreds of images and decided to create a separate website linked to <a href="http://www.jameswojcik.com/">JamesWojcik.com</a>. He created a fictional company— the aforementioned <a href="http://www.dinahrockoysters.com/">Dinah Rock Oysters</a>, named after a rocky ledge in the bay near his home—and registered the website domain last year. Wojcik and his digital tech selected images and roughed out Web pages for categories such as “Right Valve,” “Left Valve,” “Culling and Sorting” and “Recipes.” The behind-the-scenes images of Wojcik and his crew sorting and photographing the oysters were placed on a page he titled <a href="http://www.dinahrockoysters.com/#filter=.droatwork">“Dr. O and Co. at Work.”</a> He asked Steve Motzenbecker—a designer for New York magazine who has worked on many of Wojcik’s marketing efforts—to polish the logo, typeface and site architecture.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Wojcik believes that these days, a website is more valuable than a portfolio, but he was concerned people might only look at the site once. His wife suggested he make postcards with the website URL. “Postcards are timeless,” he says, “and create something three-dimensional that you can hand to people and lasts forever.</div>

His wife suggested he make postcards with the website URL. “Postcards are timeless,” he says, “and create something three-dimensional that you can hand to people and lasts forever.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He chose 50 images to go into a box set; <a href="http://www.thestudleypress.com/">Studley Press in Dalton, Massachussets</a>, printed the postcards and made the cardboard boxes emblazoned with the Dinah Rock logo. Wojcik estimates that printing and manufacturing costs were about $4 a box. Since the website went live in April, he’s emailed links to the site, and mailed about 1,000 boxes of postcards to editorial and advertising clients and designers. He also handed them out as gifts to ma&icirc;tre d’s, a fishmonger and friends, and donated 6,000 to the Suffolk County Project in Aquaculture Training to use in fundraising.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The feedback has been positive. “People can’t believe the devotion to making images of such an unattractive object.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Whether or not the series leads directly to assignment work, Wojcik says the project has already delivered less-tangible rewards. “For me it’s about being devoted to a subject and constantly exploring something,” he says. “Ultimately, keeping your name out there as a contemporary photographer and staying inspired by finding new ways to express yourself will keep people looking for your work.”</div>

<div>“I never had an idea of what I was going to do, I’d just say ‘Today it’s gold, or it’s purple, or it’s gray.’” He would shop at an art supply store near his New York studio, buying thread, lengths of string, elastic bands—anything he could find in a single color. He then gave himself an hour to assemble and shoot a single still life using the items he had just bought and any objects he had on hand that fit the day’s color palette. The objects he used ranged from the mundane—a packet of artificial sweetener, a tape measure—to works of art he had collected.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>By limiting the amount of time he gave himself to arrange and shoot each image, he ensured that he couldn’t overthink his compositions: “It’s about combining the unexpected without thinking, and reacting to shapes and forms.” Over the course of ten days in his studio, he created ten still lifes. “It’s a good thing to do because it forces you into problem-solving and quickly putting things together,” he explains. “That’s what being a commercial photographer is: You’re often photographing things that aren’t your choice, and you have a short amount of time to make something compelling.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On an assignment for <em><a href="http://www.townandcountrymag.com/">Town &amp; Country</a></em> to photograph expensive, gold-embellished handbags, he created a similar assemblage of items, incorporating the luxury items the client had supplied with a variety of objects from his studio and home that would complement the gold tones in the handbags. He shot the assignment with the same camera and lens he used for his test shots, and chose a light source that mimicked the window light in his studio that had illuminated his color-palette experiments.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>LOGISTICS</strong></div>
<div>The <em>Town &amp; Country</em> assignment called for Prince to shoot luxurious handbags adorned with gold hardware and metallic elements. In discussing ideas for the shot with the client, he recalls, “The most important thing was to show the sheen and a sense of luxury.” He suggested creating a collage of elements around the bags. Working with stylist <a href="http://www.hilaryrobertson.com/">Hilary Robertson</a>, he composed an arrangement of props. Prince decided to incorporate a Pablo Picasso bowl from his own ceramics collection into the shot. Like many of his favorite items, the bowl has appeared in several of his photos. “I said that it would be great to put that in, because it’s another reference to France and to fashion and to the world,” the photographer recalls.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As in the compositions he creates for his test shots, “I tend to put things down intuitively,” he says. “Within a couple of captures, we’ll have something, and then I just tweak it.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>LIGHTING</strong></div>
<div>When it comes to choosing lights, Prince says he tends to go on streaks, using only strobes or only softboxes for days at a time. To capture the sheen of the metallic elements, Prince chose to use a single small HMI light, an ARRI 575w fresnel light kit. “I tend to simplify as much as possible. There are times when I’ll use 16 lights,” but in this case, he says, “The HMI light made the most sense because it’s the most controllable directional light source.” He placed it on a stand about four feet from the tabletop arrangement, so it raked the light across the top. He chose to use two fill cards to bounce light into the darkest areas of shadow, though he notes that he likes the realism shadows can lend to an image.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In regards to working with the HMI, “I felt it would give me the most pop and the most saturation and the most richness,” he says, adding, “It imitates natural light.” During the color palette tests that inspired the <em>Town &amp; Country</em> composition, Prince had been using only the light from an east-facing window in his studio. In those pictures, the only control he had over the light was to draw the window shade or reposition the table. “If it was overcast, I’d move the table to the window. If it was bright and sunny, I’d move the table away.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>CAMERA</strong></div>
<div>Prince shot both the handbags and his color compositions with a tethered Phase One 645DF and an 80mm lens. Prince, his client and his digital tech, Levi Miller, huddle around the monitor to preview shots on set.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>POST-PRODUCTION</strong></div>
<div>After choosing two to three favorite images, Prince and his digital tech will tweak contrast and color values. Prince likes to edit on set, he says, “so the client is walking out with whatever they need.” When he and Miller are working on an editorial shoot like the <em>Town &amp; Country </em>assignment, Prince says he likes to make sure the final, retouched image captures the spontaneity of his personal work. In guiding his digital tech, he says, “I have comments about what’s right or wrong.” The advice Prince often gives his digital tech is advice he follows himself: “Don’t overthink it.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>David Prince will teach a seminar titled “Visual Vocabulary: The Making of a Still Life Photographer” on October 31 at the PhotoPlus Expo and Conference. <a href="http://www.photoplusexpo.com/index.shtml">Details at photoplusexpo.com</a>.</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>As senior vice president for marketing at <a href="http://www.discovery.com/">Discovery Channel</a>, Lara Richardson is responsible for all of the network’s on-air and print campaigns, social networking, domestic distribution of content and the annual upfront sales presentations. Before joining Discovery she was the vice president of creative for TLC; she has previously served as creative director at the History Channel and History International. She shot, directed and produced the film <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0876128/">Katrina: A Volunteer Story</a></em> for Discovery Production Group; she has also worked as a producer. She talked to <em>PDN</em> about the challenge of television marketing and her work with photographers to create campaigns for a variety of platforms.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: Your job as senior vice president of marketing is described as “creating and executing the vision of the Discovery Channel brand.” What do you think the vision and brand of the network is?</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>Lara Richardson: </strong>The Discovery Channel has a “brand halo,” unlike a lot of other networks. You say “Discovery Channel,” and people definitely have a distinct impression of it. That’s both a blessing and a curse, in a way. We’re storytellers, and fueling curiosity in people has always been at our core. We’re about exploration and we’re exploring compelling characters. We’ve put the focus more on people. It used to be about penguins and sharks, now it’s also about gold miners, fishermen, survivalists.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My main areas of concern involve how our brand is presented in on-air and off-air promotion, print, out-of-home and outdoor advertising, and in our strong social media presence that continues to grow daily.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: To present character-driven shows, you must commission a lot of portraiture. What skills are you looking for in a portrait photographer?</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>LR: </strong>We are about authenticity, and that can be difficult to capture. When the subjects of one of our shows are out on a boat on the Bering Sea, I may not always have a photographer there to capture the action. When you bring these subjects into a studio and try to recreate that, how do you do it in a way that is true to the brand? Most of these guys have never set foot in a studio before, and that can take a special photographer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We used [photographer] <a href="http://www.jasonelias.com/">Jason Elias</a> on the last in-studio shoot. I’d first worked with Jason when he was a gaffer. He’s a very personable guy. I knew I’d need someone who would make the talent feel comfortable. I’ve come across a lot of talented photographers, but they’re used to dealing with models. Jason is that guy who can be friends with everybody and, combined with his photography skills, he was a good fit.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We had two stages going at once: We did video on one and stills on another, and shot all our major talent in 40 setups over a two-day period. It was a lot.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Earlier this year the Discovery Channel delved into scripted programming with a miniseries called <a href="http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/klondike/videos/videos"><em>Klondike</em></a>. The challenge was: How do you convey that we’re the number one nonfiction network, but say we’re going to do this series on a scripted basis? <a href="http://kevinlynchstudios.com/">Kevin Lynch</a>, who is based in Los Angeles, had done some celebrity portraits, and I was drawn to his portraiture. He did a great job shooting a gallery for us and maintaining a sense of authenticity. He captured it very quickly, and that’s a huge deal. We didn’t have a lot of time, but he made it look like he had hours.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We’re going up to the Yukon in a couple of weeks with Jason Elias to photograph for <a href="http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/gold-rush"><em>Gold Rush</em></a>. Sometimes you have to embed a photographer [with subjects of a show]. When the subjects are searching for gold, you have to have a photographer there to capture exactly the right moments.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: How much photography are you assigning, and how much is pick-up from shows?</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>LR:</strong> We’ll do two to three off-air campaigns a quarter and we’ll typically shoot something original for those. Though we are not buying as much print [advertising] as we used to, I always need stills: on the Web, on social media. There are autograph cards and DVD covers. For the iTunes store, you need key art for that. A lot of people lift frames from video of a show, but I think that shooting proper stills to represent a show is still important.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: You’ve worked in and around network television for a while. How do you feel the marketing of television programs has changed?</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>LR:</strong> The major change is that the marketplace has gotten so crowded. It’s now harder to break through—just getting the consumer’s attention is more difficult. That’s exciting from a creative standpoint, because things that in the past were just good, or good enough, don’t cut it anymore. It’s now a balancing act between not being so out there that we alienate people who identify with the brand and have strong feelings about it, but at the same time pushing the creative so it gets someone’s attention.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: Does the fact that you’re showing photos on so many platforms change the criteria you use to evaluate photos?</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>LR: </strong>We still tend to think in terms of key art. I think if you have a clear, singular image that sums up the show, it should work at any size. That’s what I’m going for in a lot of these pictures: simple images that capture what the show is about.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: Is there particular experience or skills a photographer has to have to work for the Discovery Channel?</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>LR:</strong> It’s not so much about experience, though when I hire people, this is not their first time at the rodeo. Part of what our brand stands for is covering everything from the epic to the everyday, from the landscape of Alaska to the life of a moonshiner. So I look for photographers who can see the epic in the everyday. For example, for a show called <a href="http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/moonshiners"><em>Moonshiners</em></a>, I need a photographer who can take moonshiners and make them look epic, or can look at the landscape of Alaska and draw people into the everydayness. It may be about finding a fresh way to look at Alaska, getting in there and showing snow on a branch.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: Are you looking for new photographers or relying on a stable of people you’ve worked with before?</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>LR: </strong>I’m always looking for new talent. Sometimes I see something on the Web, sometimes I’ll see an ad in a magazine and find out who shot it. We have an internal creative agency and they have a ton of photographers in their library. They’ll show me books.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: You mean printed portfolios?</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>LR:</strong> Yes, I still look at printed portfolios.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: You’ve worked as a documentary filmmaker. Do you think that experience influences the way you work with photographers or directors?</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>LR:</strong> I think I feel comfortable talking about the creative process. I’m a hands-on person. I might have just enough technical knowledge to make me a pain in the ass, but I also appreciate the talent required to make good work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: What do you wish the photographers you work with understood better about the work of a marketing director?</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>LR:</strong> It’s not about an understanding of what a marketing director does, but an understanding of the many objectives we have to fulfill. When I first got into this, I thought I was an artist. It’s not really an art: There are ratings goals to meet, for example. There may be an amazing picture that would look great in a gallery, but if it doesn’t sell my show [then]...it’s just for fun.</div>]]></article_text>

<div>“This is all new, so a lot of agencies are learning while I’m learning," says Randolph, who is best known by her Instagram handle <a href="http://instagram.com/laurenlemon">Lauren Lemon</a>. Approaches to leveraging the platform have varied. Some brands, like Fruttare and Jamba Juice, have given her the creative control and budget to set up and art-direct her own mini shoots to accompany larger campaigns. For Fruttare, she traveled to Coachella and the iHeartRadio Music Festival to create lifestyle imagery and cheerful product shots. For Jamba Juice, she staged charming still lifes for their <a href="http://jambajuice.tumblr.com/">“Live Fruitfully”</a> campaign: strawberries sitting poolside in red bikinis and shades, plump raspberries and blueberries lining the coast on a map of California. “It was about getting out there and being bold and living life to its fullest, and being healthy and active, which goes along with what I do [on Instagram] anyway,” Randolph says.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Just five years removed from college, Randolph has attracted more than 230,000 Instagram followers—more than twice as many as some of the brands that have approached her with work—with her vibrant, cheerful portraits, lifestyle images and quirky still lifes. Her avatar typically shows her wearing her signature yellow on bright yellow backgrounds. Even her least popular posts easily clear 1,000 likes, and it’s not uncommon for her to rack up double, triple or quadruple that number for especially compelling images.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For Randolph, Instagram has proven much more effective in attracting clients than any of the moves photographers traditionally make when starting out. “I moved to LA to pursue commercial photography and started assisting and taking all the steps you’re supposed to do to get jobs, and I had gotten a few decent commercial jobs,” Randolph says. “But once I joined Instagram, I started getting this large following. Having my work and my lifestyle out there every single day—all this colorful, carefree imagery that I put on there—that’s kind of the stuff that brands have been reaching out for me to do for their projects and campaigns.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Counterintuitively, Randolph feels that the images she broadcasts to her vast network of followers feel more personal to the creative and art directors who follow her than even one-on-one communication might.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“I’ve hustled to get meetings at some great agencies,” she says, “but it’s honestly the creative directors and the people who are following me on Instagram that I’ve gotten work from. They’re seeing me post every day, they’re commenting on the photos, I’m seeing them like the work. I know that I’m staying on their radar, and it’s not just a follow-up email after a meeting that’s fed into all their other emails: it’s what they’re looking at when they’re leaving work and going home.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Which is, of course, the same reason brands want to get in on Instagram. As Randolph says, “People are flipping through it in their in-between moments, when they’re on the go, in bed.” So what is it that makes a successful Instagram post? “It should feel personal, like someone’s looking at something that you want to share with them,” she explains. “I think the most successful Instagram photos are the ones people feel like they can take themselves.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>That sounds simple, but the ways in which brands can best create successful, authentic-feeling campaigns and images for a social network predicated on being instantaneous—and how experienced Instagrammers like Randolph can help—are still in flux.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>One model that brands including Toyota and Nordstrom have tried is to hire social media photographers to shoot alongside commercial photographers on traditional shoots. On a Toyota shoot for a 2014 Prius campaign, for example, “the person shooting with the DSLR was shooting the big, wide shots with all the cars,” Randolph says, “but they wanted me to go in and shoot the little details that were approachable and felt personal— what a family would shoot if they were on a road trip with their car.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>From Randolph’s perspective, this arrangement worked better than expected. She was included in creative calls leading up to the shoot and welcomed on set. “As a fellow photographer I just didn’t want to feel like I was in the way or stepping on anyone’s toes,” she says. “It wasn’t like that at all. If anything, we kind of fed off of each other.” If the lead photographer was shooting wide, she’d stay out of the way. If he was shooting tighter, Lemon would grab one of the models and pursue her own ideas elsewhere.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Ultimately, Toyota decided not to pursue such an arrangement. “I don’t think it necessarily worked out the way we initially intended it to,” says Tony Donna, the associate creative director for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi LA who works with Toyota. Initially, Donna says, Toyota pursued iPhotographers for their influence. But the brand later got skittish about having the photographers posting for Toyota on their own channels, where Toyota couldn’t control the other content the photographers posted. The brand ended up with bloated budgets and “double the material,” without the reach and influence that they had counted on leveraging.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Randolph agrees that the arrangement wasn’t the most efficient. “They’re hiring two photographers, but technically one photographer could be doing that. I could shoot the car, and [shoot the social media images] with my iPhone.”</div>
<div>For now, Toyota is experimenting with hiring Instagrammers not just for their vision, but for their reach; notably, the brand has grown more comfortable with having photographers post on their behalf. “It’s evolved,” says Angee Murray, a senior art producer with Saatchi &amp; Saatchi LA. “We still work with our legal team and do background checks if we have time, but it’s become a lot more mainstream, especially with corporate America and the automotive industry doing all kinds of creative stuff.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For photographers, this means working more independently. “It’s not just having a second shooter on set to shoot for Instagram anymore; it’s actually doing projects specifically with influencers,” Murray says. “This year we’ve been giving them their own assignments and using them for their influence. We’re having them post on their own channels as well as creating additional content for Toyota’s Instagram and Facebook accounts.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Meanwhile, operations are springing up to connect brands and Instagrammers. <a href="http://twheat.tumblr.com/">Tyson Wheatley</a>, a successful journalist who worked for Instagram and is an influencer in his own right (500,000 followers and counting) is launching Down Right, a “boutique digital agency that helps connect brands with the right kinds of influencers to do a really awesome campaign.” Wheatley, who befriended Randolph via Instagram, says he isn’t repping photographers in an official capacity, but will “pitch the creative with certain photographers in mind, negotiate rates and manage the projects on a case-by-case basis.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“It’s still the Wild Wild West,” he says, with brands not necessarily understanding how to find the best creatives for their social media projects, or even what those projects should be. Neither side has quite settled on exactly how the arrangements should be made, or what the proper rates are.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“Right now, good or bad, the amount of followers you have can dictate higher rates, but a large following is not necessarily indicative of quality image-taking,” says Wheatley, who points out that some Instagrammers’ numbers may have been helped by being featured by the network—as both he and Randolph were—and that some certainly dabble in the “dark arts” of buying followers. “What I want to do with Down Right is tap into the people who do have big, influential followings, but who are also really talented photographers.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What the rates for this sort of work should be is one of the biggest questions for brands and creatives.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“Two years ago when we were trying this it was more like this was people’s hobby; now emerging photographers or assistants have found a way to make a career out of this,” says Murray. “Photo reps are picking them up. There are whole collectives of these iPhotographers, as we call them. And because they’ve gotten reps, they’re trying to command [higher] day rates. There are guys out there who have a day rate as a commercial photographer, but we are not using those guys. We can’t justify that yet.” </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>That’s been Randolph’s experience as well. “Definitely not all brands are onboard with the costs, but I’m trying to approach it the same way I do all my work,” she says, by putting together bids as she would for any commercial job, with budgets for models, props, and wardrobe, licensing fees and a reasonable day rate. “If it’s with my iPhone, it may be cheaper [than a commercial shoot] because I don’t need a digital tech or a bunch of gear, but at the same time, my creative day rates should still be the same, and I should still be approached as a photographer who’s creating content and using ideas that I’m coming up with.” On some assignments, she’s serving as a consultant to help the brands figure out how best to use not just Instagram, but Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook as well.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Often, the sorts of jobs for which brands approach prominent Instagrammers are inherently lower-budget productions. “They’re usually not full-blown,” says Murray. “Truthfully, it’s like we’re going to get an influencer a car for three days and let them go around town and get shots and play with the car on location or send them to an event. It’s zero production value there.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Last year Sony hired Randolph and several other influencers to test out their new Sony QX lens-style cameras that clip onto smartphones, sharing images on their own networks as well as Sony’s—a project with essentially zero production costs for the brand. Whatever the project, Wheatley advises photographers, “The most important thing is to hold onto your creative control. It’s really important that you don’t sacrifice the integrity or the authenticity of what it is that feels native to your Instagram account.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>With Randolph, he says, “there’s something about her esthetic that remains true. It’s typically very colorful and bright, and there’s definitely a happy vibe. She loves to use this hashtag #neverbummed, which is great,” he says. He advises photographers, “Don’t try to be something that you’re not. That’s really important.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>While Randolph feels that her work has largely stayed true to her brand, she hopes eventually she’ll get assignments using not just her social media skills, but her more technical skills as well. For now, her work is split about 70 percent social and 30 percent other commercial and editorial jobs, though her income is about 50/50, “as the regular commercial income is still far greater than anything for Instagram.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“I’m pursuing the whole scope of it,” she says. “I would love to get more campaigns where they’re hiring me to shoot with an iPhone as well as a regular camera.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Tony Donna of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi LA and Toyota doesn’t see any reason why she couldn’t. “She was a joy to work with,” he says, “and I follow her still.”</div>]]></article_text>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div><a href="http://www.kmorganphoto.com/">Karen Morgan</a>, a Chicago-based photographer (and pit bull enthusiast), has specialized in photographing dogs and cats in her studio and on location since 2004. Amidst plenty of competition for photographing cute pets, she has landed assignments from a variety of advertising and editorial clients, in addition to shooting commissioned portraits.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN:</em> How did you specialize in pet photography?</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>KAREN MORGAN: </strong>I have had a lot of animal training experience and a huge passion for animals my entire life. An art director who knew that hired me in 2004 to shoot branding images for a pet-collar line. After seeing the work, my rep at the time said I should focus on pets and animals. It was obvious. I’m that crazy kind of dog lady; when I’m walking down the street and I see you walking your dog, I’ll greet your dog first.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN:</em> Who are some of your clients and how do they use your images??</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>KM:</strong> Pet nutrition brands Hill’s and Blue Buffalo, Hartz pet products, Partners for Healthy Pets, Greenies, which makes pet treats and dog chews, and Pfizer, which makes medicines for pets. Clients use my images in print ads and collateral, in books, on the web, in vet offices, on pet meds, etc.</div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: There is so much pet photography now—pictures and videos of cute cats and dogs go viral all the time. Does that put pressure on you to up your game?</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>KM: </strong>Yes, it does. The content is everywhere. A great image can happen with anyone who doesn’t specialize in it, but the value of being able to produce 25 or 30 shots in several days is what makes the difference. I go over that in every conference call and client meeting. It’s definitely hard because it’s a booming niche, and you have to fight more—a lot more.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you distinguish your images from so many other pet images out there? </strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>KM:</strong> I like to get super sharp and crispy lighting that really enhances the texture of the fur, but if a pet is on the shy side, I might have to modify the light and go more for a shorter depth of field that is more about feeling rather that the visual texture.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: How is photographing a portrait of an animal technically different from shooting portraits of people?</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>KM:</strong> They are very different, depending on the effect you want. Light wraps around fur very differently from human skin and hair.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: Tell me a little more. How do you handle that?</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>KM:</strong> It’s where I put the lights and the direction. I don’t like to light animals from the front, because it flattens them. I try to light from the sides and behind and wrap the light around so you can feel the body of the animal. It’s beautiful for the pet, but if you stuck a person in there, they would not look good. So it’s a different lighting approach for a person and an animal together.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: What special equipment does pet photography require??</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>KM: </strong>Sometimes the sound of the flash can scare certain animals, so years ago I had custom lights built that do not have a popping sound when the strobes fire. Profoto and Broncolor strobes are much quieter than they used to be, but I still pull out my custom strobes when I have a dog or cat that gets nervous.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: Are there other challenges that are particular to pet photography?</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>KM: </strong>Casting is critical. Some clients want a very specific breed, [but] getting a specific breed that can also be great on set is sometimes difficult with a [tight] production schedule. I reach out to all my animal resources and connections, and I hold open casting calls if needed. I like to meet the pets myself during the casting process.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: What in particular are you looking for besides cuteness?</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>KM:</strong> The [animal’s] ability to make eye contact and not shy away from the lens pointing directly at them, and the ability to understand commands and demonstrate the certain position needed for the ad. I also assess the animal’s comfort level when their owner is out of the room, and how well they listen to me when I clear the room. I want relaxed personalities on set—no heavy breathing, shakes, etc. I instantly know when an animal will be too nervous.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: Are there particular dos and don’ts for photographing dogs and cats?</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>KM: </strong>Let the animals walk freely on set before it’s time to shoot. Do not adjust the lighting or diffusion elements quickly on set while they are present. No loud or sudden noises, and try to minimize the amount of people on set looking at the pet.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you get a dog or cat (especially a cat) to do what you want it to do on set?</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>KM:</strong> Every pet is different. I have numerous sounds, voices, toys and music [to coax the animals]. For cats, I have a special cat wrangler and trainer I like to work with on set. And most of all, you must have a calm voice and patience!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: Can you describe a typical assignment? And what assignments have you shot recently?</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>KM:</strong> A typical assignment is to shoot a library of lifestyle images and portraits, in the studio and on location, of the pet alone and with a person.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I’m currently photographing famous Chicagoans and their pets. This is for a commissioned book with <a href="http://www.thepuppymillproject.org/">The Puppy Mill Project</a>, and proceeds from sales will go to help stop puppy mills and provide veterinary care to dogs rescued from those horrible places. In 2012, 28 of my images of pit bulls were used in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Im-Good-Dog-Beautiful-Misunderstood/dp/0670026204">the book</a> <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Im-Good-Dog-Beautiful-Misunderstood/dp/0670026204">I’m A Good Dog</a></em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Im-Good-Dog-Beautiful-Misunderstood/dp/0670026204">by Ken Foster.</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: What are your rates for assignments??</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>KM: </strong>Commercial rates can range between $4,000 and $10,000 per day, depending upon usage. Editorial rates also vary dramatically between $350 and $3,000 per image or assignment.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: What’s your advice for photographers trying to get into this niche?</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>KM: </strong>I’m not happy that more people are jumping on the wagon, but if I need to put my angel hat on, I’d say that you have to know a lot about animal behavior and training. And you have to shoot whatever your passion is. If you love horses, shoot horses, not every animal under the sun.</div>]]></article_text>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div>The digital revolution has stimulated a robust general interest and demand for photography, and photo blogs are proliferating to satisfy the demand. Several photo blogs with mass audiences are updating photo galleries several times per week, creating a feeding frenzy for original photo projects. But are photographers taking full advantage of their opportunities and choices?</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The list of blogs that showcase photography—and pay photographers for the privilege—keeps growing. <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>recently announced plans to publish “more and more original content” on its <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/photojournal/">Photo Journal blog</a>. Director of Photography Jack Van Antwerp says the newspaper is “pushing forward digitally...[and] visuals are key to making that successful. Photography generates traffic.” The blog will publish up to several stories per week, and pay around $400 for each one, Van Antwerp says. <em><a href="http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a></em> <a href="http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/">Lens blog</a>, one of the most prestigious photo blogs, was among the first to publish slideshows of projects, and interview and write about photographers. It pays $350 per slideshow. Other sites with cache among photographers include <em><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth">The New Yorker</a> </em><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth">Photo Booth</a> (which pays $250), <a href="http://cnnphotos.blogs.cnn.com/">CNN Photos</a> ($600), and <em><a href="http://lightbox.time.com/">TIME</a> </em><a href="http://lightbox.time.com/">Lightbox</a> ($750).</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Others are joining the fray. <a href="https://medium.com/matter">Matter</a>, an online magazine launched in May by the story-sharing site Medium, is also hunting for compelling photo projects, with a goal of publishing one per week. So far, it has published photo series by <a href="http://www.rockymccorkle.com/">Rocky McCorkle</a>, <a href="http://www.matteichphoto.com/splash">Matt Eich</a> and another story about <a href="http://www.magyaradam.com/">Adam Magyar</a>, and it is paying “very competitive rates comparable...to Lens, Lightbox, etc.,” art director Erich Nagler explained in an e-mail.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“It has definitely become more competitive over the last couple of years,” says Paul Moakley, a photo editor at <em>TIME</em>. “There are lots of great places for photographers to think about putting their work.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>There are also a lot of photographers vying for publication. Moakley says he gets 10 to 20 e-mail pitches per day. James Estrin, who is co-editor of Lens blog with David Gonzalez, says 100 or so pitches arrive each week in Lens blog’s mailbox. Estrin gets another 100 pitches per week in his personal e-mail, from photographers, curators, editors and PR professionals representing book publishers, galleries and museums.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Blog editors also hunt for projects at portfolio reviews, and by trawling other photo blogs and magazines (print and online) that don’t have big audiences outside the photo industry. <a href="https://www.lensculture.com/">Lens Culture</a>, <a href="http://lenscratch.com/">Lenscratch</a>, <a href="http://www.fstopmagazine.com/">F-Stop magazine</a> and <a href="http://www.fractionmagazine.com/">Fraction magazine</a> are among those that are heavily mined.</div>

        </div>
        <div>CNN Photos, for instance, often picks up stories from other blogs and publications. <a href="http://fredericlagrange.com/site_v2/">Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Legrange’s</a> project on Afghanistan’s Wakhan corridor appeared as a 28-page portfolio in UK-based <em>PORT </em>magazine before CNN ran it on June 23, says Legrange. <a href="http://lizcalvi.com/lost-boys/">Liz Calvi’s “Lost Boys” project</a>, about young adult men forced to drop out of college for financial reasons, ran in <em>Fraction</em> before CNN published it on July 6.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Photo blog editors take particular pleasure in being first to discover new talent. And they put a premium on projects that haven’t been published by other blogs and websites, especially those with big general audiences. “If I see work published by a competitor, we’re likely not to cover it,” Moakley says.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Van Antwerp, Estrin and Simon Barnett, photo editor for CNN Photos, also say they’re generally not interested in stories their big competitors have run, but they will sometimes make exceptions. Photographers still have to choose carefully where they first publish a project, because they may not get a second chance. And yet a number of photographers interviewed for this story reported that they consented to publication by the first photo blog that asked.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“You have to look at this in a really sophisticated way, because some sites just throw up photos,” Estrin warns. “They don’t write about you, they don’t write about the work, they don’t give a crap about it. They’re looking for hits and nothing but hits, and you don’t get handled sensitively.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Different blogs provide access to different audiences. Some are photojournalistic and current events-driven. Others emphasize art photography. Some appeal to industry professionals more than to general audiences, and vice-versa. Photographers have to recognize and weigh those differences against their own particular goals when choosing which blogs to publish on.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Money is also a consideration—not only how much a blog pays, but whether it pays at all. Among popular photo blogs that don’t typically pay photographers publication fees are Slate’s Behold, <em>Wired </em>Raw File, Feature Shoot, Huffington Post and Buzzfeed. All are competing for photography content with sites that pay, and promise exposure rather than money. (PDN’s Photo of the Day blog does not pay a fee.)</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>But blogs that pay can provide as just much—if not more—exposure to a desired audience. And Estrin says, “There are different expectations [about paying to publish photo projects] for different sites. If a photo blog is a labor of love, even if it’s popular, their not paying [photographers] is very different from Huffington Post and Buzzfeed not paying.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Given the current level of competition for content, photographers may have more bargaining power than they realize. That’s what photographer <a href="http://anastasiapottingerphotography.com/">Anastasia Pottinger</a> recently discovered with her series of portraits of centenarians.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>When she successfully pitched her project to Lenscratch three years ago, Pottinger was little-known outside of Columbia, Missouri, where she earns her living shooting portraits. A writer for Feature Shoot re-discovered her project this past May while looking through the Lenscratch archives, says Pottinger.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“It was posted on Feature Shoot, and four hours later, CNN called me.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>By then, other blogs had picked it up, and she told CNN that the story was about to appear on other blogs. “They said, ‘Don’t worry about it. We just don’t want you to sell it to <em>TIME </em>or ABC,” she recounts. (ABC’s photo blog, called <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/picture-this-abc-news/">Picture This</a>, is updated only sporadically.)</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>After the story appeared on CNN, Pottinger says, it went viral. Dozens of blogs and web sites “just took it. Most of them re- tooled it to sound like they spoke to me.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Huffington Post, which sought permission to publish her project after CNN published it, asked her to contribute her images for free, she says. She declined. “I may have said $100 per image—something pretty high.” She ended up negotiating a $375 fee to publish 10 images. Of a half- dozen photographers interviewed for this story, only Pottinger reported pushing publishers for money.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Her experience begs the question: Should other photographers be asking for more? Blog editors—like many magazine editors—say their budgets are limited, so a photographer’s fees are fixed and unlikely to improve anytime soon. But photographers are also compensated by the exposure a popular or influential photo blog can give them.</div>
        <div>Pottinger is ambivalent about that argument, particularly from blogs that don’t pay fees. “Millions of people saw [Centenarians] who wouldn’t have seen it otherwise. That’s good for selling a book to publishers,” she says. “It’s hard because they’re dangling this fruit of exposure, but you know in the end, someone is making a living off it, and it’s not you.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Other photographers are less conflicted about giving away their work, especially if they’re trying to launch their careers. When she started pitching her “Lost Boys” project, Calvi says, “I wanted to get my name and my work out there. I didn’t even know that some [blogs] paid” for publication rights. After it was published by <em>Fraction</em>, CNN Photos picked it up.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><a href="http://www.ericcousineau.com/">Eric Cousineau</a> got his project about independent roadside motels published on the <em>Wired</em> Raw File blog. F-Stop magazine also published the project, and neither publication paid a fee. “Eventually, I’ll care about getting paid, but right now, I want to get my name out there,” he says.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><a href="http://www.dianamarkosian.com/open">Diana Markosian</a>, whose various projects have appeared on Lens, Lightbox, <em>The New Yorker’s</em> Photo Booth, <em>Boston Globe’s </em>Big Picture, Slate, NPR and Feature Shoot, says, “It sets a terrible precedent when you have outlets... not paying for work and photographers accepting it in exchange for ‘exposure’.” (Her work has also appeared in the <a href="http://www.pdns30.com/gallery/2014/#grid">2014</a> <em><a href="http://www.pdns30.com/gallery/2014/#grid">PDN’s</a></em> <a href="http://www.pdns30.com/gallery/2014/#grid">30 gallery</a>, and in a <em>PDN</em> “Picture Story” column.)</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Markosian adds, “I think many of us also feel pressure to constantly produce work and have it seen. If you don’t publish, you perish. And while many of these blogs don’t pay decent rates, some photographers (including myself ) would rather see their images featured than sitting on their desktop. My approach is to sell to a magazine first and then a blog.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Of course, Markosian is in a better position than most photographers to get her work published in print. But given the robust competition among photo blogs, a lot of photographers may have more options and negotiating power than they realize.</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>Shortly after she turned 18 in 2011, <a href="http://www.isadorakosofsky.com/">Isadora Kosofsky</a> began photographing a New Mexico boy named Vinny. He had just been sent to juvenile prison for stabbing a man who had been assaulting Vinny’s mother. Kosofsky ended up immersing herself in the project, and what has emerged is a story about a close-knit family torn by loss and a sense of powerlessness, but still holding on to love and hope.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The project, called “Vinny and David,” after the two brothers at the center of the story, was published by <em>TIME</em> Lightbox this past May with the headline <a href="http://lightbox.time.com/2014/05/21/confronting-youth-incarceration/#1">“The Intersection of Love and Loss: Confronting Youth Incarceration.”</a> The project grew out of Kosofsky’s curiosity about the juvenile justice system, which started when she was just 14 years old. She wanted to photograph teen boys who were incarcerated “because I felt like I related to them,” she says, explaining that in her early teens she had friends who were caught up in the system.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>At the age of 15, she began submitting requests for access. Her pitch to prison officials around the country was to do a project that looked beyond the “hegemonic masculinity” of prison culture by exploring the vulnerability and sensitivity of young offenders. She pointed out that as a young person herself, she was in a unique position to tell the story.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“Reading over my letters to prison officials now, I don’t think they were that convincing,” she says.</div>
<div>Every request she sent was either rejected or ignored, but her age was the main reason, she says. She continued making requests, and immediately after she turned 18, administrators of several youth prisons granted access. Kosofsky quit college to pursue the project, fearing the access might be rescinded if she waited.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“My goal was to go on a personal journey through these institutions and document the lives of these young people,” she explains. But she quickly realized after spending time in two prisons that “photographing solely in these institutions made it almost impossible to convey the extent of [the subjects’] individual identities. Their confinement rendered their story very limited. I knew I wanted to go beyond those walls, and show their humanity in context of broader society.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Upon her arrival at a youth prison in New Mexico, she met Vinny, who had just been detained. He opened up to her almost immediately. “I don’t know why some people become subjects of long-term documentary projects. There was just something I saw in him and his story that needed to be told,” she says.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Her project about youth incarceration suddenly narrowed to a project about Vinny, and her first images of him show a vulnerable, traumatized kid tasting his first prison meal, and sleeping on a cement slab.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Kosofsky sought out Vinny’s mother Eve at his next court hearing. “I told her, ‘I would like to get to know you,’” Kosofsky recounts. Eve was open from the start. On the economic and social margins, she was used to being invisible. Kosofsky surmises that someone trying to tell their story made her feel empowered.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Soon afterwards, when she knocked on Eve’s door for the first time, Eve’s oldest son (and Vinny’s oldest brother) David answered, told Kosofsky she wasn’t welcome, and shut the door in her face. Eve let her in, but it took the photographer a year to win David’s trust.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Kosofky eventually realized that David’s fear was of abandonment—that Kosofsky would be another person in his life who would take something and then disappear. “He made a comment one night, about six months in, that even if I leave I always come back,” she says. “When he said that I realized the [importance of ] being present, not even talking, just bearing witness and sitting and observing and being patient.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>David had his own troubles. He’d joined a gang, had been cycling in and out of adult jail, and lived in fear of being yanked away from the family. Kosofsky ended up becoming close to David through an exchange of letters and phone calls, including when he was in jail. While saying goodbye after one of her visits, “[David] said it was great seeing me, and I should keep in touch. That was a moment I felt was a turning point in our relationship,” Kosofsky recounts.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Kosofsky says she became so integrated into the brother’s lives, she started to feel like a sister. Then she began to worry about how immersed she had become. Kosofsky says she was living a divided life—her own, and theirs—that was blurring into one, and it was difficult to separate emotionally from the family and their story.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“It’s definitely a conflict in all [my] projects to find the balance between being compassionate, empathetic and emotionally present, and at the same time, conserving that photographic distance,” she says. But she also says she doesn’t “really believe that the objective stance even exists, and I think that some of the most powerful photography is from that subjective view, where the photographer has become part of that community.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Kosofky says the family didn’t even notice her taking pictures after a while. Nothing was off limits or hidden, and Kosofsky’s images focus intently on the relationships, interactions and emotions of her subjects. Frustration, anger, fear, resignation, compassion, joy, love and hope are all on display, and Kosofsky shows the full range, dignifying her subjects as real, multi-dimensional people, not archetypes of poverty or prison culture. “This is much more a story about family than about incarceration. Incarceration is a facet of it, [and] I think it’s very important that is at the forefront. But they’re not defined by their incarceration. And I very much wanted to show the confinement that they live in outside of the context of the actual penal system,” she says. Kosofsky believes that their confinement is emotional, stemming from traumatic experience and the feeling of social invisibility and powerlessness.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>She began editing her images last summer after nearly two years working on the project. She kept a journal to help edit the work, and six months ago, she showed the work to <em>TIME’s</em> Nicholas McClelland. He had championed <a href="http://lightbox.time.com/2012/05/15/the-three/">“Senior Love Triangle”</a>—another project Kosofsky had started as a teenager, about the unusual relationship of three seniors fighting the fear and loneliness of aging together. Lightbox published that story in May 2012.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“The theme of love and loss is something that is in all of my work,” she says.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Kosofsky is now returning to college, where she’s focusing on gender studies. She says she’ll continue to work on the “Vinny and David” project indefinitely. “There's no time constraint, no end date.” She adds that she hopes to engage as many people with the story as as possible. “I’m thinking of ways to expand it for publication [as a book] and exhibition.”</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>Some appear as wraiths, twisting phosphorescent and half-formed out of a looming void. Others are roiling clouds of fire and pitch, echoes of primordial conflagrations. <a href="http://www.christianweber.net/">Christian Weber,</a> who reveals that he always wanted to be a painter, cheekily describes the process that produced his new book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Christian-Weber-Explosions/dp/3866788843">Explosions</a></em>, as “painting with energy” and indeed, there is a depth and abstraction to his images of pyrotechnics.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>The inspiration for <em>Explosions</em> came from a commissioned fashion shoot in 2009 for which Weber decided to utilize pyrotechnics. He had been doing some “light reading on physics,” and was also intrigued by the dramatic transformation of energy that he saw from the explosions on his shoot. Though the idea of creating a series of photographs of explosions was enticing, Weber mulled the concept for more than a year before deciding to move forward with it. “If I see something and am drawn to it, I tend not to act as quickly as some people might,” he says. “The true test for me is if it stays with me for a time and I still feel compelled to do it, then I know it’s right for me.”</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Drawing upon contacts he had made doing commissioned work, Weber established a relationship with a pyrotechnician he felt could help make the project a reality. The first order of business was to locate an appropriate outdoor space that would be available for an extended period of time. Once they found their “studio” in a Connecticut rock quarry and secured the necessary permits, the pair got down to business. “We started experimenting, first by combining explosive compounds to produce different colors and levels of intensity, and [then] by creating a way to control the trajectory of an explosion,” Weber explains.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>It was slow work—they rarely set off more than five or six explosions in a day, and Weber points out that all of the images in the book were shot in daylight. The darkness of the backgrounds is the result of the extreme intensity of the heat and light generated by the blasts blotting out the sun.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>In an effort to keep things simple, Weber used just two cameras, one focused wide and the other tight, both fired by a single remote. This allowed him to capture both the “sculptural aspect of this energy display” and a shot of the interior of the explosion for its “textural detail.” Having started taking photographs a quarter-century ago, Weber comes from a background steeped in traditional photography techniques, so his initial instinct was to shoot the project on 4x5, using chrome, while utilizing a Canon 5D Mark III as the second camera. However, after blowing up test prints from both cameras, he found that the difference in resolution was negligible, and that the digital media was outperforming film in this context. Given the brevity of the explosions, the responsiveness and efficiency of the DSLR was hard to ignore. In the end, more than 70 percent of the images in the book were shot digitally.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Rather than using laser or sound triggers to fire the cameras, Weber triggered the cameras manually. He refers to the process as “the draw.”  “I wanted to rely on instinct, skill and good old-fashioned countdowns,” Weber elaborates. His remote fired each camera simultaneously, and each took a single picture. He admits there were more than a few misses in the early going, but feels the process was an integral part of the final result. The tension of the countdown, the brute force of the blast, and the raw anticipation all kept him wired into the moment, lost in the act of creating. This organic approach also meant that, as the project progressed, Weber began to operate more instinctively, experimenting with the timing whereby, instead of aiming for the exact point of detonation, he might trigger the camera fractions of seconds later. Precision was less important than immersing himself in the action.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>From the beginning Weber envisioned the project as a book and was “plotting it as I worked,” he says. As the book began to take shape, he realized that he wanted to include some text: He was drawn to the idea of including a poem as well as a piece that could elaborate on the science behind the images he was creating. Familiar with <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/john-yau">John Yau’s</a> Jackson Pollack-inspired poetry, Weber reached out to Yau. The poet and critic responded enthusiastically, contributing a poem. Forensic scientist Peter Diaczuk covered the scientific angle, contributing an essay full of insightful digressions on the history and nature of man-made combustion.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Beyond the literal flash-bang spectacle and the power and beauty of this crude manipulation of physics, Weber believes these images are about time and the human experience. “The explosions represent life. Each one is completely unique, unable to be duplicated or to recur as the same event, “ he says. “The explosions are momentary phenomena, imperceptible to the human eye. When you see one of the detonations, it is impossible to process the details. You can feel the force and hear the energy, but the visual details are lost. The photographs allow me to process the event and see what had actually happened right before my eyes.”</div>]]></article_text>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>Photography can be a dirty business. The electronic gear photographers require is typically loaded with materials that can be toxic to the earth. Here are some of the ways you can cut down on electronic waste and limit your energy use. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>RECYCLING YOUR GEAR</strong></div>
<div>A few organizations that will take your old electronic gear and keep it out of landfills.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>The Biodiversity Group</strong></div>
<div>This international organization, whose mission is to maintain environmental landscapes for future generations, runs a program in Tucson, Arizona, called <a href="http://www.camerasforconservation.com/">Cameras for Conservation</a> that puts your old cameras to good use. Cameras for Conservation accepts gear like camera bodies and lenses that biologists and photographers in the Biodiversity Group use to document diversity all over the world. Cameras for Conservation will provide a receipt for the donation and the price of shipping your camera to them so you can get a tax-deduction. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div><strong>INFO:</strong> <a href="http://www.biodiversitygroup.org/donate/donate_now.html">www.biodiversitygroup.org/donate</a></div>
<div>   </div>
<div><strong>Recycling for Charities (RFC)</strong></div>
<div>This organization gives individuals the opportunity to donate or recycle old cameras, cellphones, iPods, iPads and more. If your camera or electronic gear is in good enough condition, RFC will refurbish it and donate it in turn to the charity you choose so it can be used again. For each donation, RFC also contributes a minimum of $.25 to the selected charity. When electronics are beyond repair, RFC strives to recycle them as responsibly as possible. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div><strong>INFO: </strong><a href="http://www.recyclingforcharities.com/index.php">www.recyclingforcharities.com/index.php</a> </div>
<div>   </div>
<div><strong>Free Geek</strong></div>
<div>This Portland, Oregon-based nonprofit provides free computers and education in exchange for community service. It recycles technology in two ways. The first is by refurbishing old technology and then donating it where it’s needed—schools, free tech classes and other volunteer programs—or offering it for sale in the Free Geeks thrift store. The second method is by simply recycling equipment that can no longer be refurbished in a responsible manner. Free Geek has a suggested two-dollar recycling fee for cameras, which helps fund its volunteer programs, such as free classes for the community. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div><strong>INFO:</strong> <a href="http://www.freegeek.org/donate/">www.freegeek.org/donate/</a> </div>
<div>   </div>
<div><strong>Staples and Best Buy</strong></div>
<div>Both of these massive office and electronic supply stores offer recycling opportunities. You can bring your old camera to any Staples or Best Buy location and they will recycle it for you. They work with recyclers to adhere to recycling guidelines and standards. </div>
<div>   </div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>Canon</strong></div>
<div>Canon has developed the Canon Consumer Products Recycling Program to assist their U.S. customers in recycling their products. Canon works with its customers to ensure appropriate recycling of products including cameras, lenses, flashes and more. All you need to do is purchase a shipping label online to send in the products that you want Canon to recycle. A shipping label for most DSLR cameras costs six dollars. </div>

<div>   </div>
<div><strong>Samsung</strong></div>
<div>This camera and electronics maker has partnered directly with take-back and recycling companies to recycle old Samsung products. Samsung has fixed drop-off locations across the U.S. where you can leave your old products for recycling. Simply go online and find the store closest to you. They have also started a program called S.T.A.R., a free service that lets business and consumer printer customers recycle empty toner cartridges by sending them to Samsung. </div>

<div>   </div>
<div><strong>The Disabled Photographer’s Society</strong></div>
<div>This U.K. charity promotes photography for people with disabilities and for groups that are involved in helping the disabled. Their many programs include technical support for disabled photographers. The Society accepts donations of most photography equipment including cameras, lenses, tripods, cases and more. You can send your equipment to their offices in Kent. </div>

</div>
<div><strong>GREEN PRODUCTS</strong></div>
<div>Innovative products made with clean, renewable resources.  </div>
<div>   </div>
<div><strong>Flash Drives from Renewable Materials</strong></div>
<div>Plastic tossed in a landfill may take up to 1,000 years to decompose and can potentially leak pollutants into the ground. While plastics are made of fossil fuels, wood—especially bamboo, which grows rapidly—is a renewable resource. <a href="http://www.photoflashdrive.com/">Photo Flash Drive</a> is one of many companies that now offer wooden and bamboo flash drives that function just like normal flash drives, but are made of renewable resources. Both the wooden and bamboo options offer a variety of capacities, starting at 2 GB of memory and going all the way to 64 GB. They are offered in a variety of colors and some can be engraved. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div><strong>PRICE: </strong>Starts at $14.67 for 2GB and ranges to $64.17 for 64GB</div>
<div><strong>SIZE: </strong>2.4 x 1.1 inches</div>
<div><strong>INFO:</strong> <a href="http://www.photoflashdrive.com/">www.photoflashdrive.com</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>Solar Camera Bags</strong></div>
<div>Solar energy is one of the cleanest sources of energy, and solar camera bags allow you to use that power to charge your rechargeable batteries and other electronic devices. <a href="http://www.eclipsesolargear.com/">Eclipse Solar Gear</a> offers a variety of solar-enabled camera bags. All you need is a standard 12V car adapter: Just as the car adapter transfers the energy from the engine of a car into an electronic device, this adapter can transfer energy collected from the bag’s solar cell to your device. The Eclipse bags offer plenty of storage, with compartments for all your photography equipment, and they come in different styles, including backpacks and side-strap camera bags. <a href="http://www.eclipsesolargear.com/productcart/pc/viewPrd.asp?idcategory=0&idproduct=18">The “Nova” bag</a>, for example, can hold a DSLR camera along with three lenses and adjustable foam dividers for specific gear, with room for still more accessories. It has an adjustable padded shoulder strap and exterior pockets, as well. The approximate charging time for a camera is four to six hours, depending on how strong the sunlight is. Although not waterproof, all bags are made of durable materials and can be left outside. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div><strong>PRICE:</strong> Nova $79.95</div>
<div><strong>SIZE:</strong> 15 x 9 x 10 inches</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>Last year, the <a href="http://www.ilcp.com/">International League of Conservation Photographers</a> (iLCP) joined with <a href="http://wilderness.org/wild/?gclid=CKDFha6q-MACFaUF7AodgSMASw">The Wilderness Society</a> to create a series of photographs of Idaho’s Clearwater Basin, an area of more than 9,000 square miles that includes beautiful forests, pristine rivers and some of the only remaining roadless wilderness in the lower 48 states. The photos have become an important part of The Wilderness Society’s efforts to protect and preserve the Clearwater Basin from threats including logging and road construction. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div><a href="http://www.enviro-pic.org/Enviro-pic.org/Home.html">Krista Schlyer</a> and <a href="http://www.amygulick.com/">Amy Gulick</a>, two photographers from the iLCP, a non-profit organization whose members create images and other content that help advocate for environmental causes all over the world, worked with The Wilderness Society for several days to photograph the landscape, wildlife, and the local people who live, work and recreate in and around the basin.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>A Wilderness Society donor initially connected the group with the iLCP, which evaluates projects based on several criteria, including the credibility of the organization, whether funding is in place or needs to be raised, and whether “the campaign is critical and timely so the images are going to have an immediate use,” explains iLCP Executive Director Alexandra Garcia.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Once iLCP signs on for a project, it puts a call out to its member photographers, who apply to work on a project. “We specifically said that we wanted two kinds of photographers: one that was going to do the fauna and landscape and one that was going to do the people piece,” Garcia recalls.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>The work appealed to Gulick for a number of reasons. A Seattle-area-based photographer, Gulick considers the Clearwater Basin an extension of the Pacific Northwest. “Anything in my backyard, I feel I have a responsibility to let the world know how incredible it is and do whatever I can to preserve and maintain it in a responsible way going forward,” she says. She also appreciated the history of the place as part of the traditional home for the Nez Perc&eacute; people, and the beauty of the wilderness. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Working with Jeff Halligan, a Wilderness Society representative, Gulick made photographs of people who live in and interact with the Clearwater landscape in various ways. “People are a crucial part of the Clearwater story,” Gulick says. “The people that live there are so tied to the land. It is their way of life.” Environmental and conservation photography often depicts the landscape, but misses “half the story” when it doesn’t also focus on people in the landscape, she notes.  </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>For Schlyer, the Clearwater Basin project lined up with her previous work on public lands and wilderness, and clean water issues. “I’m just really interested in wilderness designations and protections as well,” she says. Schlyer worked with Halligan for nine days to “get into as much wilderness as possible to try to convey both the intrinsic and indirect values of wilderness, but also some of the more tangible values like clean water, intact forests and things like that.” She also made two flights with <a href="http://www.lighthawk.org/">LightHawk</a>, a non-profit organization and frequent iLCP partner that provides free flights to people working on conservation photography and research. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>The Wilderness Society has worked for the past six years as part of the <a href="http://www.clearwaterbasincollaborative.org/">Clearwater Basin Collaborative</a> (CBC), a 23-member group that includes political blocs, conservation organizations, the timber industry, off-road vehicle groups, sportsmen and -women and others: in short, a “bunch of different people who use the land in very different ways,” says Brad Brooks, The Wilderness Society’s Idaho Deputy Regional Director. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>“The task when we came together was trying to figure out whether or not we could support one another so everyone is getting something that they want,” Brooks says. “It’s been going quite well. For us the ultimate prize is permanent protection through legislation of special places as wilderness and other designations.” </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>A year ago, the CBC came to a signed written agreement to create a half-million acres of permanent protections and roughly 200 miles of river protections, Brooks says. That agreement formed the basis for legislation that the CBC is currently working to introduce in partnership with Idaho Senator Mike Crapo. (At press time Brooks did not have a timetable for the legislation, and he noted that national politics in the lead-up to the primaries was “affecting our timing in an unfortunate way.”)</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>The CBC agreement, however, “doesn’t mean that all of the local communities know what we’re doing or agree with it,” Brooks says. The Wilderness Society realized it needed to invest in building grassroots support, and the images that Schlyer and Gulick produced are an important part of that effort, which has included print brochures that explain the work of The Wilderness Society and CBC, and hundreds of local presentations throughout the Clearwater area. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>The photographs help the Wilderness Society tell the story of the basin to people inside the basin, nearby in Idaho, and in Washington, DC. “We can talk about places and designations and acres of wilderness in abstract terms, but when you put a picture in front of somebody and you say, ‘This river or this mountain needs to be designated as wilderness,’ there’s a visceral reaction that’s so much different than talking about it in the abstract.”</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>In a conservative state like Idaho, where citizens are wary of any government intervention, photographs also help change the conversation, Brooks says. “In the abstract it’s very easy for people to just say ‘No.’ But when you’re showing photos and saying, ‘Wouldn’t you agree that this place should stay the way it is today,’ most people would say, ‘Yeah, I can remember when I was a kid, hunting with my dad, and it’s just amazing. I hope it doesn’t change.’”</div>]]></article_text>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>Two years ago, <a href="http://www.burklehagen.com/">Andrew Burkle</a> was a photo assistant in Chicago with a ten-year plan for establishing a career as a photographer. This spring, he found himself far ahead of schedule when he opened a 6,000-square-foot food photography studio in Cleveland with business partner <a href="http://www.burklehagen.com/about/">David Hagen</a>. They’ve already shot for national food brands including Jif, Crisco and Martha White; and for Vitamix, the Cleveland-based maker of food blenders.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Burkle was taking all the usual steps to prepare for his transition: building a nest egg, test-shooting regularly, and showing his portfolio to prospective clients. But he says the key to transitioning faster than he expected was the impression he made as an assistant. He worked hard, put his best foot forward on set, and learned how to communicate with crew and clients alike. People noticed, and wanted to work with him. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Burkle, who is 28 years old, graduated from Ohio University in 2009 with an interest in portrait photography. He moved to Chicago and worked first as a freelance assistant doing portrait and fashion work. After about nine months, he answered a help-wanted ad on Craigslist for an assisting job at <a href="http://stephenhamilton.com/">Stephen Hamilton Photographic</a> (SHP), a big Chicago food photography studio. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>He loved the atmosphere. “Everyone was super nice, and they collaborated. I wasn’t a big fan of all the make-up artists, the models, and the ego in portrait and fashion work,” he says. Soon he joined SHP as a full-time assistant, with a new goal of becoming a food photographer. “I had to throw my [portrait and fashion] portfolio in the garbage and start over,” he says.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>At SHP, he learned as much as he could about the business. “It was just being vigilant, and being a sponge. You don’t want to ask too many questions, though, because that makes it look like you’re prying.”</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>With Hamilton’s encouragement, Burkle used the studio every Saturday to do his own test shoots. He’d pack his gear in his car to and from the studio to simulate the feel and the routine of paying assignments, he says. At first he didn’t have money for big productions. “I’d go to the farmer’s market, pick out some vegetables, and do tight beauty shots,” he says. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Eventually he started approaching food and prop stylists he’d met on jobs, asking for help with his test shoots. Many were assistant stylists willing to work in exchange for images for their own portfolios. But one was a top Chicago food stylist who rarely helped anyone with test shoots, he says. She and others who didn’t need portfolio prints were willing to help him because they saw it as an investment in someone who might hire them later, he explains, adding, “When you’re working as an assistant, it pays to have good relationships with the crew, not only because it makes the shoot go better, but because they’re willing to help you.”</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Meanwhile, Steve Hamilton’s studio was so busy that Burkle and other assistants effectively worked as photographers. They interacted with clients and set up shots. That was invaluable experience, Burkle says, explaining that many assistants get so used to working in the background that they have trouble thinking and acting like a photographer when they try to go out on their own. “As a photographer, you have to have confidence and know how to lead a shoot,” he says.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>While working for SHP, Burkle was saving money. He lived in a small apartment to pay less rent than he otherwise would have. He deposited his paychecks in a savings account at one bank, and maintained his checking and credit card accounts at another. That arrangement forced him to spend more consciously, he says, and it kept him from spending on things he didn’t really need, like a new TV or car.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>His plan for striking out on his own was to move into a space that could double as a studio and living space. He’d then earn some more money, move into a bigger space, and repeat the cycle until he had enough business—and savings—to open a food photography studio separate from his house. “It was a tiered plan,” he says.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Meanwhile, Hagen was in Cleveland, ready to go out on his own after working for years for <a href="http://kpphoto.com/">Kalman &amp; Pabst Photo Group</a> (KP Photo). Because KP Photo had recruited interns from Ohio University, Hagen knew Burkle, and had kept an eye on his portfolio. When he was in Chicago visiting KP Photo clients, he’d arranged to meet with Burkle at SHP. But when Hagen arrived there, Burkle was too busy trying to wrap up a major shoot for an SHP client. He ended up giving Hagen a quick tour and rushing him out of the studio.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>“It was 9 o’clock at night. Six or seven people were still working, and Andrew was the one orchestrating everything,” Hagen recalls. “He’s producing, retouching and shooting for big clients. And on top of that, he’s a nice guy. I’m like, OK, that’s a guy I can work with.”</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Hagen followed up with Burkle by e-mail, proposing a business partnership, and outlining a rough business plan for opening a studio together in Cleveland.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>At first, Burkle had no interest in leaving Chicago for Cleveland. “It didn’t sound appealing, but the more I thought about it, the more it made sense,” he says. A number of national food brands are based in northeast Ohio, including Nestl&eacute;, J. M. Smucker and Vitamix. The city has a vibrant restaurant industry, and real estate and other overhead costs are dramatically lower than Chicago’s.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Burkle and Hagen met for dinner a few times to get better acquainted, and decided the partnership would work. “We’re both laid back but hard working,” Burkle says. They found an industrial studio space for $1,200 per month—less than what Burkle was paying for his apartment in Chicago. With business loans and their savings, they built out the space with two full kitchens. The studio opened for business in May. Their roster includes both local and national clients, and when they’re not shooting, they’re busy promoting themselves. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Burkle says he and Hagen are committed to running BurkleHagen as a teaching studio. “Assistants will have to shoot their own work or we’ll ask them to leave,” Burkle says, explaining that he believes assistants who shoot their own work are more engaged on the job. It was, after all, one of the keys to his own quick rise in the business.</div>]]></article_text>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div><a href="http://ingallsimages.squarespace.com/">Bill Ingalls</a>, who has been a NASA photographer since 1989, describes the variety of assignments he covers, and explains what he looks for when hiring other photographers for the U.S. space agency.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN</em>: How did you become a NASA photographer?</strong></div>
<div><strong>Bill Ingalls:</strong> I was in college at Waynesburg University outside of Pittsburgh. An alumnus who worked for NASA offered a [media] internship. I was fortunate enough to win that, because other students I was competing against got afraid and gave up. That was a lesson in life: Don’t give up.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN:</em> How did the internship turn into a career?</strong></div>
<div><strong>BI: </strong>I finished my degree and taught television production at Robert Morris College [now called Robert Morris University] in Pittsburgh. But I’d had such a great summer at NASA that I continued to call repeatedly [about openings]. I joke that they got so sick of me calling that they said, “Get him an office in the corner and we’ll hear less from him.”</div>
<div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">	</span></div>
<div><strong><em>PDN:</em> What was your assignment, and how has it evolved since you started?</strong></div>
<div><strong>BI:</strong> When I first started, my job was to cover press conferences at NASA headquarters, and shoot a lot of grip-and-grins—VIP handshakes, awards ceremonies. We still do all of those things, but we now cover bigger assignments outside of Washington, DC, too.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN: </em>Like what?</strong></div>
<div><strong>BI: </strong>We make a lot of trips to Florida to cover Space Shuttle launches and landings. And we have our hands full covering our relationship with the Russians. My first trip to Russia was for meetings with our counterparts in 1991, [and] my first [Soyuz] launch in Kazakhstan was in 1995. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>NASA recognizes the power of the photograph. If you ask people about the most important photos we’ve seen in our lifetime, most people are going to mention the first time we saw earth from space. That has not gone unnoticed within NASA.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div><strong><em>PDN: </em>What are you looking for when you’re covering a Soyuz launch?</strong></div>
<div><strong>BI:</strong> I try to capture some of the people doing that work, and hopefully a little bit of emotion. That’s sometimes the toughest thing when you’re talking about photographing hardware: trying to bring in the human element. Seeing a rocket is exciting, but I’ve seen it a lot of times, so I look around at peoples’ faces. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN:</em> What’s the most appealing part of this job for you?</strong></div>
<div><strong>BI:</strong> I like a challenge. We’ve shot a million press conferences here at NASA headquarters, and every time I ask myself: What can I do to tell the story in a creative way? You need to be on your toes. For any assignment I’m given, I do my homework. I make sure I understand what the mission is, and often I prepare caption templates and keywords. I think about who will be there, and I pre-visualize the assignment and ask: What kinds of images might I get out of this? So when I’m on assignment, I’m not thinking about these things for the first time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN: </em>Aren’t you straddling the line between documentary and public relations photography?</strong></div>
<div><strong>BI: </strong>Yeah. I’m a NASA contractor, but I do think that one of the reasons my office has been fairly successful is because we don’t just put out smiley images. NASA is known—in government circles, at least—for being on the forefront of social media, and for engaging the public. They take that same kind of thinking to photography and TV. We do a good job at keeping it real.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN:</em> What gear do you typically carry in your bag? </strong></div>
<div><strong>BI: </strong>The basic bag for all the photographers in the office is two Nikon D4 camera bodies, with 14-24mm, 24-70mm and 70-200mm lenses, a couple flashes and maybe a couple of 1.4x teleconverters. Then there’s a shelf of shared equipment, with lots of prime lenses.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN:</em> Is there any specialty gear that NASA photographers use?</strong> </div>
<div><strong>BI: </strong>The biggest thing, which is not unique to NASA, is remote triggering devices. You can’t stand 100 yards from the rocket and take pictures, even though I’ve done that.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN: </em>You have?</strong></div>
<div><strong>BI: </strong>At the first Soyuz launch we [photographed] in 1995, we had set up a tree of remote cameras and said, “Let’s get out of here.” Our guide said, “This is where you’ll stand for the launch.” It wasn’t a smart thing to do. It’s extremely loud, and there’s a lot of debris that flies around the pad. Anything loose on the ground becomes a projectile. It’s not unusual for us to go retrieve our remote cameras and have the front end smashed out of the glass.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN:</em> What type of experience do NASA photographers bring to the job?</strong></div>
<div><strong>BI: </strong>It’s very mixed, from sports photography to travel to fine art, even. And I should point out that we wear multiple hats. We’re not just photographers. My job is senior photographer and project manager. Another contractor is a photographer and photo editor. The other position is photo archivist and photographer, which requires experience with digital asset management.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN:</em> How do you select photographers? What do you look for?</strong></div>
<div><strong>BI:</strong> It’s extremely tough. A lot of good, very talented photographers want to work here. Obviously you’ve got to have the chops to make good pictures, but that’s not hard to find these days. We’re looking for personality, too: folks who can remain calm and handle the stress and frustration that can come with this job. There’s bureaucracy to deal with. I tell folks: Taking pictures is the easy part of your job. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN: </em>So how do you find the right people?</strong></div>
<div><strong>BI: </strong>With a lot of interviewing, a lot of references, and knowing people. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong><em>PDN: </em>What advice would you give to photographers who aspire to shoot for NASA?</strong></div>
<div><strong>BI: </strong>My advice is that it has to be something you love in order to get good pictures from it. But you have to show a range, too. The sexy stuff is only 10 percent of it. A lot of people walk in the door and can’t wait to go to a launch, but I have to tell them, “You’re going to shoot some passport photos, you’re going to do some grip-and-grins, you’re going to do awards ceremonies,” and I still do those things to this day. That’s what pays the bills, and we’re lucky we get to shoot this other stuff that keeps us jazzed.</div>

        <div>Much of the controversy surrounding the proposed extension of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry crude oil from oil reserves in Alberta, Canada, to refineries on the Gulf Coast, has focused on the environmental impact of the pipeline as it cuts across prairies and wetlands. Less often discussed is the oil itself, which is being extracted from reserves in the Alberta tar sands, an area surrounded by boreal forest and peat bogs. A NASA scientist has called tar sands oil “one of the dirtiest, most carbon-intensive fuels on the planet.” </div>
        <div>   </div>
        <div>Having read about the massive effort to extract and process tar sands oil, aerial photographer <a href="http://www.alexmaclean.com/">Alex MacLean</a> was curious to document the operation from the air. After visiting the Alberta tar sands in April and photographing its impact on forests, the water supply and the local First Nations community, MacLean calls what’s happening in the area “ecocide.”  </div>
        <div>   </div>
        <div>MacLean, who is based in Massachusetts, shoots aerials for editorial and commercial clients and has published several books, many of which focus on the environmental impact of manmade structures. He knew that if he photographed the tar sands, he wanted to reach a larger audience than he could through the sales of a photo book, and so was eager to place the work in online news outlets. </div>
        <div>   </div>
        <div>MacLean sought advice about funding a project from <a href="http://dangrossmanmedia.com/">Dan Grossman</a>, the author of several books and magazine articles about environmental issues. Grossman suggested that they collaborate and pitch a story focused on the Alberta tar sands to the <a href="http://pulitzercenter.org/">Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting</a>, the nonprofit journalism foundation which funds photographer/writer teams and helps publicize their stories. MacLean recalls, “We put in the proposal, and we were funded in about two weeks,” with a grant specifically for foreign reporting. </div>
        <div>   </div>
        <div>The story is timely. The Alberta tar sands make up the third largest oil reserve in the world, but its oil “comes in the form of bitumen, a combination of clay, sand and very heavy oil that’s tar-like. It has to be diluted if it’s going to be shipped through a pipe,” MacLean explains. “There’s so much energy expended to get it out of the ground and processed that it’s a lot more carbon-intense than regular crude oil.” If a proposal to extend the pipeline is approved, even more Americans will get their fossil fuels from the tar sands. MacLean proposed to show “the scale of the operation” by shooting from a rented plane at 1,000 feet.</div>
        <div>   </div>
        <div>Bitumen located less than 70 meters below cap rock is mined by stripping away trees and topsoil. To extract deeper reserves, steam has to be pumped into the ground “so the bitumen can be pumped out,” MacLean says. Having photographed rows of huge furnaces, steam and oil pipes, towering pyramids of sulfur and other byproducts, and retention ponds “the size of Manhattan” built to hold water waste after it’s washed the bitumen, he observes, “The capital investment is mind-boggling.” He photographed trucks big enough to hold small homes, carrying bitumen and byproducts. These trucks run on tires 12 feet in diameter that “cost about $65,000 each and only last about six months. You can get a sense of how much money is being spent.” </div>
        <div>   </div>
        <div>Knowing that a covering of snow could add dramatic contrast to images of forests and peat bogs, MacLean was eager to get to Alberta before the spring thaw. In April he and Grossman flew to Edmonton, then rented a car to drive to Fort McMurray, an oil boomtown. Over the course of their trip, MacLean rented three planes, usually a Cessna 172; because his pilot’s license doesn’t allow him to fly in other countries, he had to work with a pilot. </div>
        <div>   </div>
        <div>MacLean didn’t know what working alongside a writer would be like, he says. “I usually work by myself, and fly by myself.” At the start of the trip, Grossman interviewed climate scientists and ecologists, and spoke to locals throughout their trip. This background, MacLean says, “helped shape what I wanted to shoot.”</div>
        <div>   </div>
        <div>In Chippewa, roughly 125 miles north of Fort McMurray, for example, Grossman talked to members of the local First Nations community who, concerned about the high incidence of cancer, feared that the food that they hunt and fish for along the Athabasca River had been contaminated. MacLean decided to show how close the tailings ponds, which hold waste, had been built to the river. “The other thing that is really apparent is air pollution,” he says, such as the fine, coal-like dust that blows off piles of petroleum coke. “I got pictures of boxcars hauling sulfur,” which is then carried long distances. </div>
        <div>   </div>
        <div>From the air, MacLean documented scars that the search for oil has left on the landscape, and some of the oil companies’ attempts to repair the damage. One of MacLean’s photos shows the boreal forest cut into a grid: The lines are made by surveyors who set off seismic explosions in search of bitumen. “When you fragment a forest, it loses a lot of its biodiversity,” MacLean notes. After caribou wandering into these clearings became easy prey for wolves who could spot them from great distances, the oil company began making the sight lines curvy. Bogs of muskeg peat, which took thousands of years to form, have been removed to get to the bitumen below. “The company promises to put it all back,” says MacLean. </div>
        <div>   </div>
        <div>Throughout their trip, <a href="https://twitter.com/grossmanmedia">Grossman sent out tweets</a> about their travels. By the time they returned, he had found an outlet: The story was published in July by <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/groundtruth/tar-sands-alberta-signs-wealth-destruction">Global Post</a> and The Ground Truth Project. <a href="http://pulitzercenter.org/projects/north-america-alberta-oil-sands-keystone-tar-energy-aerial-photography">The Pulitzer Center posted a version of the story</a> on its website and promoted it on social media, and helped get MacLean’s photos published in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/07/10/alex-macleans-new-photos-_n_5574405.html">Huffington Post</a>, <a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/3029771/see-the-devastated-landscape-of-the-alberta-tar-sands-from-1000-feet-above"><em>Fast Company’s</em> Co.Create</a> site and other outlets this summer. The thousands of comments and “likes” his images have received show he has reached a larger audience than he could have through a photo book, “which sells 6,000 to 15,000 copies,” MacLean says. “The work has gotten a lot of use, which I find encouraging.”</div>
        <div>   </div>
        <div>In May he traveled to Port Arthur, Texas, to photograph the opposite end of the pipeline, where the oil is refined. At press time, he and Grossman were using <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tar-sands-truth">the crowdfunding site Indiegogo</a> to fund their return to Alberta when fall foliage is out. Maclean hopes eventually to document the entire route and all the structures being built to handle the process from oil extraction to distribution. </div>
        <div>   </div>
        <div>MacLean notes that, in his aerial work across America, he had often photographed abandoned infrastructure, such as the network of canals built in the 19th century. They represented a huge capital investment and the cutting edge in transportation technology at the time, but were abandoned quickly after the advent of the railroad. MacLean says of the infrastructure he documented in Alberta, “I think ultimately we have to walk away from it if we’re going to mitigate the climate-change issue.” At the moment, however, these operations are being expanded to meet future demand. How does MacLean feel about that prospect? “To my point of view, it’s a bummer to think about the gas in my car being 17 to 21 percent more carbon-intense, but it might happen if this oil finds its way into our supply.” </div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>Photographer and documentary filmmaker <a href="http://benknight.com/">Ben Knight</a> knew very little about dams in the United States before Patagonia, Inc., founder <a href="http://www.patagonia.com/us/patagonia.go?assetid=3351">Yvon Chouinard</a> approached him to create a film about them. Knight and his co-director, Travis Rummel, were also unfamiliar with the heated debate about dam removal and the future of the more than 80,000 dams that restrict the flow of rivers throughout the country.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>But their past films—on fly-fishing and a proposed open-pit mine that threatens the Bristol Bay ecosystem in Alaska—had convinced Chouinard and his friend, producer <a href="http://stoeckerecological.com/about.html">Matt Stoecker</a>, both veterans of the river restoration movement, that Knight, Rummel and their production partner <a href="http://www.feltsoulmedia.com/thewire/about/beda-calhoun/">Beda Calhoun</a> “had the right sensitivity” to create a film about their cause.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>At first, Knight felt the subject of America’s dams was too broad. “It seemed so difficult to make a film that could engage people,” he told <em>PDN</em> from his home in Colorado. “It took a little while to realize we shouldn’t say no to a great opportunity just because it was hard.”</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Eventually Knight and Rummel, partners in the production company <a href="http://www.feltsoulmedia.com/thewire/">Felt Soul Media</a>, “figured out we would have to find those human stories” that would help tell a larger story.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Knight also used his naivety to his advantage. He narrated and edited the resulting film, <em><a href="http://damnationfilm.com/">DamNation</a></em>, in a way that brings the viewer along during his learning process. “I thought it would really help it not feel like propaganda if the audience was learning with me along the way,” he explains. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Early in the film, Knight takes viewers through the history of dam creation in the U.S. Dams were built primarily as hydroelectric power generators, to divert water supplies for agriculture and other uses, and to run factory machinery. The maintenance and operation of those tens of thousands of dams have long provided jobs and, in some cases, important hydroelectric power. Dam removal proponents argue, however, that the benefits from the vast majority of the dams don’t outweigh the damage they do to watersheds.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>To create the film, Knight and Rummel identified a short list of dams they wanted to film. “We were looking for controversial dams,” he says. Then they began to interview people who were involved with those dams in one way or another. Interviews begat other interviews, as subjects made suggestions for more people the filmmakers should speak with. In all, Knight and Rummel conducted more than 50 interviews and traveled 10,000 miles in a borrowed van.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>They were also fortunate in that two major dam removal projects were completed during the three years it took to make the film. They were able to film the removal process and document such results as salmon returning to the spawning grounds they’d been kept from in Washington’s Elwha River since 1910.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>The film is visually stunning. Knight says he shot the film “like a still photo,” rather than using “fancy camera jibs and cranes and time-lapses.” Knight’s theory was that if he “went to the trouble to wait for good light and compose [a shot well]” then viewers would be captivated by the shots. He and Rummel were worried that the film would be boring to watch, but they were able to use tripod pans and, because they worked with the <a href="http://www.red.com/products/epic">RED Epic</a>, could zoom or do other things in post to add movement to the film. “We definitely went to a lot of trouble to make this thing digestible and fun, and being the editor I absolutely obsessed over not losing people’s attention,” Knight adds.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Though the film was sponsored by Patagonia, Knight says that it was a “huge concern” that he and Rummel create a balanced film that explores both sides of the debate. Knight says their insistence on balance surprised Patagonia at first, but that they “pushed really hard, because 100 percent of the time, if you show both sides of the story it’s only going to make the film stronger.” The problem they ran into is that pro-dam politicians refused to speak to them, a problem they acknowledge in the film. “It really bummed us out because it would have made a stronger film if we could have had more of their voices in it,” Knight laments. Still, they found other, creative ways to explain the pro-dam position, such as by filming politicians’ speeches at a pro-dam rally and interviewing a dam technician about the days before the dam he worked on was shut down.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>The Patagonia backing “has been a huge blessing,” Knight says. The sponsors’ passion for the film drove the project, and they didn’t balk when the filmmakers explained they needed more time. “They were open to whatever was best for the film,” Knight adds. “Their goal from day one was just to get as many eyes on it as possible, and for the story to be the best it could be.”</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Yet the corporate sponsorship also created difficulties, Knight notes. Pro-dam advocates may have refused to be interviewed because of the Patagonia branding, and Knight worries that there are film festival or television opportunities they are missing because of the sponsorship. “It’s kind of this weird red flag that makes it feel more like advocacy than just a straight documentary; but I really think we’re going to see this more often, where companies who care about these things are going to start funding films.” </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Still, Chouinard was able to place <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/opinion/tear-down-deadbeat-dams.html">an op-ed in</a> <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/opinion/tear-down-deadbeat-dams.html">The New York Times</a></em> when the film was released, advocating for the removal of “deadbeat dams,” those that have less value than the river ecosystems they disrupt. The filmmakers were also able to premiere the film at the South By Southwest Film Festival, where it won an audience choice award. And the film has picked up awards at the Environmental Film Festival, the International Wildlife Film Festival and Mountainfilm, among others.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>“To win audience choice awards with a film about dams, it just makes me laugh. I’m so psyched,” Knight says. “It feels like a dream come true.” That audiences respond to the film is no accident, though. Knight says he “tried really hard to put in a little something for everyone” by including a diverse range of characters and stories, from the destruction of Native American fishing grounds and the Army Corps of Engineers employee who lost his job by advocating for the removal of a dam he’d worked on for decades, to the 95-year-old woman who’s been fighting to get rid of Glen Canyon dam for a half-century and likes to swear. “There’s [also] the stuff I call cheating,” Knight says. “Amazing music and pretty images. I think that stuff helps a lot too.”</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>In addition to the festivals, the film received weeklong theatrical releases in Los Angeles, New York City and Portland, Oregon. Patagonia has organized screenings, and there is also a grassroots program that allows organizers to raise money for local river restoration efforts, with dozens of screenings scheduled nationally and internationally. Knight says the response at the screenings he’s attended has been “incredible.” </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>“At almost every screening someone comes up to me in tears,” he says. “I think people grew up around rivers or have some strong connection with rivers. I think this really hits them hard.”</div>
<div>   </div>
<div><em>DamNation </em>also includes a call to action. Patagonia and the filmmakers are collecting signatures for a petition that advocates the removal of four dams on the Lower Snake River in Washington, which could restore salmon and steelhead populations. As of this writing, the petition had nearly 30,000 signatures. The filmmakers and Patagonia hope to collect more than 50,000 signatures and deliver the petition to President Obama this fall.</div>]]></article_text>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>When photojournalist and filmmaker <a href="http://www.shaulschwarz.com/">Shaul Schwarz</a> decided last year to launch his production company, <a href="http://www.reelpeakfilms.com">Reel Peak Films</a>, he had two goals in mind: to help photojournalists produce short documentary videos for editorial clients, and to convince editorial clients that there’s value for them in spending the time and money required to make videos of high quality.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Schwarz has gathered teams of collaborators who can handle every aspect of filmmaking—including not only photographers who are directors, but also people who can help with shooting, recording audio, editing and production. While photojournalists are used to working solo, Schwarz says, “the ones who are serious about filmmaking realize it’s not a one-man show.” While he was completing his feature-length documentary, <em>Narco Cultura</em>, there were “hundreds of people around me,” he says.  </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>After that three-year project was released in theaters last year,  Schwarz wanted to continue making films, but wanted to work on projects that would take less time to complete. He began developing ideas for eight- to ten-minute films and pitching them to editorial clients like <em>TIME</em>. Though the projects were less complex than his feature-length documentary, he knew he needed a second shooter and an editor if he wanted to do the job well. “I was taking this approach that we should take it seriously and do it cinematically, and not do the magazine thing of, ‘Oh, maybe you can take an extra day and shoot some video.’”</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Still, he needed to convince editorial clients to spend money on the resources he needed. Most publishers evaluate online content solely by page views, he says: “Did you get 10,000 clicks? Then let’s make ten shitty things and we’ll get ten times the clicks.” Schwarz believes that by producing videos that are equal in quality to a magazine’s feature articles,  they can not only attract viewers but also bolster  subscription sales and help the publication in other ways. “What print media is not seeing is that it could be a broadcaster. Broadcasters have been doing exceptionally well for the last five years.”</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Reel Peak’s mission, he says, is to help magazines make broadcast-quality documentaries. “We’re a company that comes to magazines, bringing photojournalists and other talented people from the film industry, and says: ‘How do we help you bring your brand into the broadcasting world?’” </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>To form the company, Schwarz talked to photojournalist friends who had experience shooting films, including Jessica Dimmock, Gillian Laub, Jared Moossy, Yoni Brook and Leeor Kaufman. He also gathered experienced editors willing to collaborate on projects. As Kaufman explains, with a team of experienced people, Reel Peak “could help get photographers to do greater things with their footage than they could have without the help of filmmakers.” Schwarz found an office in New York City and moved in an editing suite. Reel Peak’s website went live in the fall.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div><a href="http://www.reelpeakfilms.com/rise/">One of Reel Peak’s first projects was</a> <em><a href="http://www.reelpeakfilms.com/rise/">Rise</a></em>, about iron workers building the 104-story tower on the site of the World Trade Center, which Time.com ran in September 2013 as part of a package of stories about the building. <em>Rise</em> was directed by Schwarz, with cinematography by Maisie Crow and Christina Clusiau, and edited by Jay Arthur Sterrenberg. Schwarz says the narrative is not groundbreaking, but the video’s production values “skyrocketed it to a whole new level.” </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>As a producer, Schwarz has to determine “who’s good at what and who needs help where.” Before Reel Peak had officially launched, <em>TIME </em>asked Schwarz to help make a video out of a story that Magnum photographer Peter van Agtmael had shot about Bobby Henline, an injured Iraq War veteran who has become a stand-up comedian. Van Agtmael had little filmmaking experience, so Schwarz suggested bringing in Jared Moossy, a photojournalist and experienced cinematographer, to help shoot the film along with van Agtmael’s girlfriend, Gaia Squarci. Schwarz notes, “Peter was smart enough to say, ‘This is great, I don’t have an ego to prove,’ and he was willing to step away from the camera,” and focus on directing and doing interviews. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div><em><a href="http://www.reelpeakfilms.com/healing-bobby">Healing Bobby</a></em> <a href="http://www.reelpeakfilms.com/healing-bobby">marked the debut last year of Red Border Films</a>, the documentary filmmaking division launched by <em>TIME</em>.  The nine-and-a-half-minute film took four days of shooting and three weeks of editing. Most videos Reel Peak has made for editorial clients are shot in seven days or less, Schwarz says, which makes them economically feasible for many publishers. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Assignments have come to Reel Peak in a variety of ways. Most of the work for <em>TIME</em> has come from stories Reel Peak has pitched to editors. This spring, Whitney Johnson, director of photography at <em>The New Yorker</em>, asked Schwarz for help producing <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/maidan-tonight-tomorrow">a video she was planning about the protests in Kiev’s Maidan Square</a>. Staff writer Jon Lee Anderson and photographer Davide Monteleone had already spent weeks on the ground. Monteleone had also shot video footage, but had no interviews.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>“To make a piece that’s of such high quality it mirrors the quality of the content that we publish in our magazine, we need two shooters. We need high production values,” Johnson explains. Johnson asked Schwarz to find an additional cinematographer and help coordinate video production on location. “It’s almost as if he became a partner, a collaborator,” Johnson says. “I count on him the way I count on a photo editor on my team.”</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Schwarz sent Kaufman to Kiev, where he began interviewing protesters. Kaufman’s goal when he works on a film, he says, is “to find characters who reflect an interesting story.” Johnson says, “Leeor became more of a first shooter, and we used Davide’s work as more the B-roll.” Johnson previewed several edits of the video, <em>Maidan: Tonight, Tomorrow</em>, which was shown on <em>The New Yorker </em>website.  </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Johnson says, “More and more as I think about a piece and how it’s going to be visualized in print, I’m also thinking about how it’s going to be visualized on a tablet and online. I think video is another way to tell a story well and can compliment an article.” She says <em>The New Yorker</em> is now collaborating with Reel Peak on a second, in-depth video package, but says the budget isn’t available to do many videos that take as much time and effort as the <em>Maidan</em> film. She explains, “We still need a lot of online content,” and some of that is in the form of short, quickly made videos produced by an in-house multimedia team.  </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Reel Peak has three full-time staffers. Schwarz has had to learn how to run a small business and cover overhead. “It’s a whole different mechanism,” he says. Schwarz says Reel Peak will eventually expand into commercial advertising work. The company is also working on feature-length films.  One is an expanded version of <em>The Last Clinic</em>, Maisie Crow’s 50-minute documentary about the anti-abortion fight in Mississippi, which Crow released via The Atavist, the online platform, last year. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Crow edited the documentary by herself. “I was in a vacuum,” she recalls. Schwarz “has been a mentor to me about filmmaking,” Crow says. When he saw the screening of <em>The Last Clinic</em>, she recalls, “He said to me, ‘There’s a real film in there, but this isn’t it.’” To expand the film, Clusiau joined Crow as a second director, shooting more footage and additional storylines. Working with Clusiau and Schwarz, “There’s so much discussion about how to shoot it—storyboarding, narrative structure,” Crow says. “I wouldn’t have gotten this far without them.” Schwarz hopes the film will be ready in time for the 2015 film festival season. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Crow calls the Reel Peak business model  “a fantastic idea.” She says, “They’re combining the strengths of photojournalists and the way they shoot video with strong documentary narrative.” As more publications look for video, Crow can imagine other production companies following Reel Peak’s lead. “I hope so. The more of them there are, the more high-quality videos we’ll be able to see.”</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>Outdoor adventure photographer <a href="http://www.petemcbride.com/">Peter McBride</a> began his ongoing project about the Colorado River in 2008 to bring attention to the plight of what he calls “the Southwest’s lifeline.” </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>“Few people realize the architect of the Grand Canyon turns into a whimper and dies 90 miles shy of the Sea of Cortez,” McBride says via e-mail. “I strongly believe that if more people knew that, the river would have a better shot of coming back to life.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>“My goal is to show that we have dried up and left for dead one of the greatest rivers in the world, and that we are all to blame,” he says. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>The Colorado River supplies water to the growing towns and cities of the southwest, but mostly it is used for agriculture. It has been diverted for years by ranchers to irrigate hayfields. It also irrigates fields for growing fruits and vegetables. “One hundred percent of the nation’s winter salad bowl”—that means lettuce, grown mostly in California—“is Colorado River-grown,” McBride says.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>McBride, who describes himself as a documentary photographer and fresh water advocate, has done much to get the word out. In the past six years, he has published a book—<em><a href="http://www.petemcbride.com/coloradoriver/">The Colorado River: Flowing Through Conflict</a></em>—and more than 40 magazine articles. He has produced, shot and edited an award-winning documentary film called <em><a href="http://www.bullfrogfilms.com/catalog/chasw.html">Chasing Water</a></em> that has been screened at numerous film festivals and aired on PBS. A new short documentary about the river, <em>I Am Red,</em> is currently on the documentary film festival circuit. He has also shot and produced several web shorts, and his images have been displayed in exhibitions at festivals and museums. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>McBride’s work on the issue began six years ago, after a ten-day assignment for <em>National Geographic Adventure</em> following writer/adventurer Jon Waterman on a source-to-sea paddle down the Colorado. “I quickly realized that the story of the river was much bigger and demanded something more,” McBride says. At the time, he was casting about for a personal project, “something closer to home after years of assignment travel abroad,” he says.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>His connection to the river was certainly personal. McBride grew up on a cattle ranch nearby. “I learned to swim, boat and fish on the river, and even ski on the snowpack that supplies its flow,” he says. He saw the water diverted into the ditches that irrigated the hayfields on his parents’ ranch. “Ranchers often call irrigating ‘chasing water,’ so I guess I’ve been chasing water and playing on the river and its flow my entire life.” </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>McBride has emphasized an aerial perspective to distinguish his take on the river. “My father is also a good mountain pilot, so that helped, as I was able to hire him,” he says. The aerial photos highlight the beauty and vast expanse of the watershed, and reveal how people are connected socially and economically to the river. “It shows us where we as humans have been and where we haven’t—or where we are going.”</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Although he’s an advocate for the river and its restoration, McBride says he tries to be as objective as possible and let his work “do the talking, because I find that more effective than preaching too much from a soapbox,” he explains. He shows the beauty of the landscape, the wilderness and the recreational uses, as well as what he calls “its less-than-romantic [side]”—industry, agriculture, drought, wastefulness—“and I try to do it all in an artistic way,” he says.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>McBride says the attention that the project has garnered results from a combination of luck and “persistent hard work. I’d also like to think the body of work was unique and different enough [to] spark interest,” he says.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>He’s used the exposure to help drive support for river restoration. Whenever he shows or publishes the work, he includes a call-to-action for viewers who want to help, or who simply want to learn more about the issues. “I just point them to a group that I think is doing good work,” McBride says, explaining that he prefers to let the film intrigue viewers without telling them specifically what they should do.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>McBride believes his work has had a positive impact, however difficult to measure it may be. “I think at the least, my work has moved the needle a smidge with the public—making them think about our watershed differently,” he says. This past spring, Colorado River water managers released enough water so that for the first time in 15 years, water flowed across the Colorado River delta and into the Sea of Cortez. “I’d like to think my work played a tiny hand” in that restoration experiment, McBride says.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>That release of water turned into another chapter in McBride’s project. He and Waterman followed the flow across the delta on assignment for <em>Outside</em> magazine, ostensibly paddling to the Gulf of California, but at times dragging their kayaks through the foliage and extremely shallow water along the way. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>The delta is dry again, but never mind how short-lived that water-release experiment was. For McBride, it was cause for hope that the river someday might be rescued and once again flow to the sea. “That helps keep me going, and hopefully the public, too,” he says.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>In the meantime, the project and McBride’s work as a river advocate is far from finished. The water levels of the river continue to drop. Nevada and Arizona, with their growing populations in desert regions, are on the brink of statewide water shortages, “so new chapters are forming,” McBride says. “My guess is that to some degree, this project will continue for my life (in small doses at times), in part because I enjoy documenting my backyard—mostly the beauty but also its growing challenges—as frustrating as some can be.”</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div><em><a href="http://lodretvandret.com/vandret/matter/">MATTER</a></em>, a new book from <a href="http://lodretvandret.com/vandret/publications/">Vandret Publications</a>, is an inter-disciplinary, collaborative art/science project created by an eclectic group of visual artists. The decidedly avant-garde book was assembled, Frankenstein-like, from the bones of a 1963 book by the same name. The original <em>Matter </em>was the first volume in the popular Life Science Library series of books published by Time-Life. Written by physicist Ralph Eugene Lapp, a member of the Manhattan Project, the educational primer presented complex scientific ideas to lay readers, in part through the use of scientific illustrations. Fifty years later, the collaborators behind <em>MATTER</em> used that same framework to create an experimental textbook examining the intersection of photography and science.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Photographer <a href="http://matthewgamber.com/">Matthew Gamber</a> is one of the six artists who collaborated on the current iteration of <em>MATTER</em>. It all began with an idea by fellow visual artist <a href="http://www.billsullivanworks.com/billsullivan/HOME_1.html">Bill Sullivan</a>. “He and I had been working independently on similar ideas about color: how we see it and how the camera technology creates it,” Gamber recalls. “[Sullivan] had a concept for a possible collaboration, and he is the one who deserves credit for initiating contact with <a href="http://marymeehan.com/">Mary Voorhees Meehan</a>, a graphic designer, and Vandret Publications,” the publishing arm of Lodret Vandret in Copenhagen, Denmark, run by <a href="http://www.rosenmunthe.com/">Johan Rosenmunthe</a> and <a href="http://www.flemmingovebech.com/">Flemming Ove Bech</a>.   </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Initially, the artists planned to make a book from scratch, but Voorhees Meehan suggested using the 1963 book as a medium for their images, providing a cohesive frame to display their individual work together. The result is something greater than the sum of its parts. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sullivan’s background as a painter informs his photography, which is concerned with layers and texture. He employs various rephotography techniques, and his ethereal landscapes look like watercolors. Meanwhile, Gamber’s photographs trade heavily in the expectation of color and its absence. One of his images renders a color-blindness test in steely black-and-white. Another converts television color bars to a monochromatic image. Charland’s work appears as a form of anachronistic futurism: fire, light and electricity course through eerie tableaux created from everyday objects. Interspersed with their art are illustrations and photographs from the original <em>Matter</em>, their utilitarianism subverted by this re-contextualization.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>The layout follows that of the 1963 book, Gamber says, but they stripped out the text and pasted their images directly on top of the original illustrations. Their images highlighted “photography’s ability to illustrate ideas about color.” Gamber explains, “In our eyesight, color is a unified property. However, through photography, color is fractured and layered.” </div>
<div>  </div>
<div>Sullivan, Gamber and Voorhes Meehan created the first version of <em>MATTER</em> in 2011 as a self-published book. That effort grew from a catalogue for <a href="http://sashawolf.com/exhibitions/the-sum-of-all-colors/press-release/">a group exhibition</a> at Sasha Wolf Gallery that included Sullivan, Gamber and fine-art photographer <a href="http://www.jessicaeaton.com/">Jessica Eaton</a>. (The book also included text by design writer <a href="http://peterahall.com/">Peter Hall</a>.) In addition to selling the first version of the book, Sullivan also pitched it to publishers.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>When Vandret agreed to publish a new edition of the book, founders Ove Bech and Rosenmunthe joined in the creative collaboration, with Rosenmunthe contributing images. Due to scheduling conflicts, Eaton couldn’t collaborate on the second edition, but experimental photographer <a href="http://calebcharland.com/">Caleb Charland</a> was added. Charland’s fascination with the intersection of science and photography was perfectly at home in <em>MATTER</em>. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>With all the contributors in different locations, the work was primarily done online. They exchanged ideas through a private Facebook group, and passed files amongst themselves via Dropbox. Gamber says he viewed their physical separation as an opportunity rather than a hindrance, allowing them time to “really consider the merits of each other’s contributions and develop responses that are appropriate for the edit,” he says. “Flexibility and trust were key elements in this collaboration. If someone had an idea and means to execute it, they had a green light to try it.”</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Rosenmunthe and Ove Bech stripped away everything but the images from the 2011 book, re-sequencing them and presenting the new, stripped down model as the template on which to begin anew. For her part, Voorhees Meehan had to adapt her original design to incorporate the group’s new ambitions: Instead of simply removing the text and adding their images, in this version of <em>MATTER</em>, the collaborators decided to add text from Isaac Newton, Goethe and contemporary color engineer Richard Lyon, while bending snippets of Lapp’s original writing to a new purpose. The group retained the grandiose chapter headings from the 1963 Time-Life book such as “An Endless Searching for Substance” and “The Wayward, Willful Ways of Gas,” but in their new context they operate as curious literary fragments, jostling with the images.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“One of the issues with practicing science is that it is difficult to describe to laymen,” Gamber says. “Science illustration is not only a means to educate [in the] basic principles of experimentation and observation, but also serves as a public relations tool to promote science literacy to the layperson.” He sees the new edition of <em>MATTER</em> as an inversion of, and commentary on, that concept. “My hope is that people will be both entertained and educated,” he says, “that it will provide an esthetic experience that takes them out of the everyday, and at the same time, [that] there is an educational aspect to it.”</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div>When visiting the website of Brooklyn-based fashion and beauty photographer Billy Kidd, viewers are greeted with the catchy tagline "I Was Shot by Billy Kidd," along with a list of shoots and projects that have quickly grown in number and prestige. A recipient of several <em>PDN</em> honors—including <em>PDN</em>'s 30 2014: New and Emerging Photographers to Watch—Kidd has seen his client list flourish since he moved to New York City from Scottsdale, Arizona, in 2009.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>A growing interest in his work required a fresh presentation of his portfolio, and in 2012, he decided to revamp his website. "I needed something new," he says. "So I decided to try the <strong><a href="http://www.squarespace.com/tour/photographers/?channel=display&amp;subchannel=photogroup&amp;source=us&amp;campaign=campaign1_article2_links&amp;subcampaign=photo_video" target="_blank">Squarespace</a></strong> format, and I was amazed at how simple it was to deal with the design and formatting." Kidd was so impressed with <strong><a href="http://www.squarespace.com/tour/photographers/?channel=display&amp;subchannel=photogroup&amp;source=us&amp;campaign=campaign1_article2_links&amp;subcampaign=photo_video" target="_blank">Squarespace</a></strong> that he leant his page to the site's tour page of photography-geared templates, joining fine-art photographer Dina Goldstein, <em>National Geographic</em> photographer Paul Nicklen, among other acclaimed photographers.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>When we chatted with Kidd about his website design, he emphasized his preference for a clean, white background with a single-frame presentation for his images. "My style has always been minimal," he says, "and I felt that white makes it easiest to read the text. Though I don't include a lot of words—I like to let the viewer bring what they want."</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>While Kidd's taste in website design is minimal, his imagery is not; Kidd prefers bold colors or contrasting black-and-white, and there is a level of expressiveness (and often, intensity) that commands attention from viewers. A simple, clean layout and easy navigation was crucial to allowing his portfolio to speak for itself, and an easy-to-use backend to keep his content up to date.</div>
        <div><br />

        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>"For my previous website, I hired a professional coder and designer," Kidd says. "The trouble was, it was all Flash-driven. A lot of people would visit the site but they couldn't do anything, especially if they used a mobile device, and after just a few seconds you tend to lose people. So I wanted to create something that was simple and immediate."</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>He took a DIY approach, selecting a template from the <strong><a href="http://www.squarespace.com/tour/photographers/?channel=display&amp;subchannel=photogroup&amp;source=us&amp;campaign=campaign1_article2_links&amp;subcampaign=photo_video" target="_blank">Squarespace</a></strong> offerings and modifying the fonts and format to his own taste, for his new site at <a href="http://billy-kidd.com" target="_blank"><strong>billy-kidd.com</strong></a>.

        <div>Kidd posts a lead story that pops up when you first visit the site; this changes periodically when he gets new material. When we spoke with him, the lead story was a shoot for Details featuring Armando Cobral in a series of dashing blue suits. "He's a model and also an entrepreneur," Kidd says, "and he's very charismatic." Other recent work includes a breezy black-and-white series of beach scenes from Coney Island for <em>Num&eacute;ro</em>, a luminous set of exotic faces for <em>Vogue Italia Beauty</em>, and portraits featuring exotic outfits modeled by Maggie Laine for <em>OOO </em>magazine's Prada Special.</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>Last year, photographer <a href="http://www.danielpshea.com/">Daniel Shea</a> made public a conversation he’d been having with colleagues about sexism in editorial photography with <a href="http://blog.danielpshea.com/post/60281468632/gillian-wearing-self-portrait-as-my-uncle-2003">a post on his blog</a>. In it, he asked why there seemed to be so many more men working in editorial photography than women. The post was shared hundreds of times, and it drew a number of responses from female and male photographers alike.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As a continuation of the conversation about gender equality in editorial photography, Shea interviewed photo editor Jessie Wender. Before she left her position at <em>The New Yorker </em>for <em>National Geographic</em>, Wender, who had previously worked at Esquire, VII Photo and Time Inc., talked to Shea about how she and other photo editors at <em>The New Yorker</em> assigned photographers for the magazine, and she offered advice for women photographers who are building careers in the editorial photography market.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>Daniel Shea: Do you consciously consider gender when hiring artists for commissions? And if so, does it get talked about in the office and amongst the other editors who have hiring capabilities?</strong></div>
<div><strong>Jessie Wender: </strong>When hiring for a commission, I consider a number of things: the subject itself, the location of the subject and the photographer, and the photographer’s interests and personal bodies of work. I don’t consider gender when determining whom to commission for a specific photograph unless the subject somehow feels “gender specific.” That said, gender is something we talk about more generally with our commissioning—we want to have a balance of men and women photographers whom we work with. In my blog posts [on <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jessie-wender"><em>The New Yorker’s</em> Photo Booth</a>], I try to be very conscious of gender, race and sexuality. I want to make sure that in my research and representations, I am showcasing photographers from diverse backgrounds. I think about this especially with thematic blog posts that feature a number of photographers exploring the same topic.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>DS: What makes a certain subject feel “gender specific,” or more broadly, what is it about certain subjects that might prompt you or other editors to seek a queer photographer, or a black photographer? </strong></div>
<div><strong>JW: </strong>Oftentimes it is about access. I can think of two fairly recent examples. We commissioned Kate Brooks to photograph Saudi shop women for Katherine Zoepf’s piece, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/23/shopgirls">“Shopgirls.”</a> Director of Photography Whitney Johnson and photo editor Elissa Curtis [who is now with MSNBC.com] wanted a woman to photograph this story because she would have the best (and maybe the only) access to the subject. [<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/07/11/a-womans-place-3">A profile</a> of Facebook CEO] Sheryl Sandberg is another example. Because of her focus on women and leadership, we consciously wanted to commission a woman photographer. We often think about the connection the subject will or will not have with the photographer, and the linking or juxtaposing of artistic visions. In other words, we may hire a photographer who has a developed body of work on a topic that is in the same vein as the subject’s interests—either working with these interests in a commission, or contrasting them. For example, if a photographer has a significant body of work on lesbian couples in America, it might make us excited to commission that photographer to photograph a subject that fits that profile.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div><strong>DS: Are there times when you and the other editors take a look at the past few issues and see how the gender balance for commissions actually breaks down? Does the more intuitive decision-making that goes into how you commission lead to actual hiring equality?</strong></div>
<div>JW: The hard thing with a weekly magazine is that you’re so busy. There isn’t a lot of downtime to stop and take a look at the past few issues. We’ve acknowledged [that] having more women shoot for the magazine is something we want to do, so it takes place more at the hiring level, rather than during a time of reflection. For example, when a story comes to my desk, and I am pitching photographers, I look at my list and want to see that there are women in the mix.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div><strong>DS: Have you experienced sexist attitudes and biases as a female in the industry? Do you feel that sexism is part of the editorial photography industry?</strong></div>
<div><strong>JW: </strong>In the workplace, and in the industry, I haven’t felt discriminated against because of my gender. Our department is all female. Many of the top photo editors I know are women. I think it is very important for women to mentor other women. In terms of sexism or biases that would affect who we decide to commission, I would also say that I haven’t experienced that. Besides the “gender specific” examples above, the only time I can think of when gender would play a role in our decision-making would be if we were going to send a photographer into a very physical situation, wanting to make sure that the person was appropriate. In this case it could be either a man or woman. When we get this detailed, we’re not thinking as broadly as gender, we’re thinking very consciously about the photographer as an individual.</div>
<div>   </div>
<div><strong>DS: On the surface, it seems that most editorial photographers are men, and most photo editors are women. Do you have any insight into this gender breakdown?</strong></div>
<div><strong>JW:</strong> Sadly, I don’t have any insight into that, but I would agree, it does seem that way. As in other arenas, perhaps it is that having children makes it harder for women to be as mobile as men. The stability of a full-time job is an easier framework to work around. But there are great examples of women with children who do amazing editorial photography and artistic work—<a href="http://micheleasselin.com/">Michele Asselin</a>, <a href="http://www.tierneygearon.com/">Tierney Gearon</a>, <a href="http://www.elinorcarucci.com/">Elinor Carucci</a>, <a href="http://www.cassbird.com/home.php">Cass Bird</a>, etc. I recently spoke with a friend who is a female photographer, and she thought since, in many cases, photographers are expected to go to new frontiers and photograph, safety might be a real issue for women in a way that is less of a concern for men. I also spoke to a male photographer who said that perhaps it is because most photography assistants are men, and that traditionally photographers would rise through the ranks this way.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>DS: Do you have any advice to emerging female photographers who are looking to start pursuing editorial work in a job market that appears to be favoring men disproportionately?</strong></div>
<div><strong>JW: </strong>My advice to emerging photographers is the same across the board—to take photographs consistently, and prioritize your photography, even if you are working for others. Pursue personal projects that interest you—this will both keep you inspired and active when work is slow, and it will also get you noticed and remembered by photo editors. Know where you see your work being published, and contact photo editors in a targeted and genuine way. I do think I receive more e-mails from male photographers asking for meetings than from women photographers. Make sure you are putting yourself out there, and that you are in touch with the right people [for your work].</div>
<div>   </div>
<div><strong>DS: What can magazine photo editors do now, in 2014, to responsibly tackle the problem of under-representation by female artists? </strong></div>
<div><strong>JW:</strong> I have always assumed that it is my responsibility to make sure that the photographers I am pitching for stories are an equal balance of male and female, and that I am meeting with female photographers. Sadly, I think the male-to-female editorial photographer ratio is a problem that extends far outside what takes place at the commissioning level, into education, assisting opportunities, agency representation and our culture in general.</div>]]></article_text>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>In its 13-year history, the nonprofit foundation <a href="http://www.capefarewell.com/">Cape Farewell</a> has worked with more than 300 artists to create cultural and artistic responses to climate change. It has commissioned works of art, hosted artists in residency and, from its offices in London and Toronto, organized festivals and exhibitions in Paris, Chicago, New York City, Marfa, Texas, and across Canada. Given the variety and scale of work the organization has produced, it’s hard to believe that Cape Farewell began as the brainchild of one artist, <a href="http://www.bucklandart.com/">David Buckland</a>. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In 2001, Buckland, a photographer and filmmaker, became interested in the artistry of mathematical models, which scientists were using to project future scenarios based on current data. The model makers encouraged him to speak to oceanographers who had gathered information on rising sea levels and other effects of climate change. He recalls, “The oceanographers were jumping up and down, saying, ‘Why isn’t anyone listening to us?” He told them, “Because you’re talking in a language that is a mystery to 90 percent of the population.” Buckland decided to find a way to “take science language and translate it into narratives, pure storytelling that would engage the public.”  </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He formed a nonprofit supported by several foundations, arts councils and private donors, and recruited a board of directors. He then began convening gatherings, bringing together groups of climate scientists with artists—including poets, writers, sculptors, filmmakers and photographers. His hope was that after “bombarding these 20 creative souls with information,” they would be inspired to respond with art in their own media.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“I never have a contract with the artists,” he explains. “I say, ‘Come and absorb everything. Come with the willingness to make something.’”  Supporting as yet unseen, unplanned works “is difficult to sell to funders,” he says, but provides the artists with welcome freedom.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In Cape Farewell’s early years, its gatherings of artists and scientists took the form of expeditions to the Arctic (Ian McEwan’s novel <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Solar-Ian-McEwan/dp/B006QS132Y">Solar</a></em> was inspired by his time on a Cape Farewell voyage). But three years ago, Cape Farewell held a retreat in Toronto for 20 artists and a group of “informers,” including economists and social scientists looking at the impact of technology and trade on climate. Before the end of the retreat, Buckland says, the artists were given a tour of the Contemporary Culture exhibition space at the <a href="http://www.rom.on.ca/">Royal Ontario Museum</a> (ROM). “We said: In two years’ time, this is where your work will be shown. Come up with something.”  Work that participants produced, as well as other projects selected by Claire Sykes, the curator and programming director of Cape Farewell’s North American organization, were shown during <a href="http://www.capefarewellfoundation.com/carbon14/">Carbon 14: Climate is Culture</a>, an arts festival held from October 2013 through February 2014. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In addition to the ROM exhibition, Carbon 14 featured a play, performances, lectures and other exhibitions held around Toronto and in other cities. A museum in Kitchener, Ontario, for example, hosted <a href="http://www.themuseum.ca/exhibition/surface-tension-future-water/eamon-mac-mahon-currents">“Currents,”</a> an exhibition of aerial images by photographer <a href="http://www.eamonmacmahon.com/">Eamon Mac Mahon</a> on the subject of water use. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sykes says that when Cape Farewell holds retreats, it typically invites artists who haven’t previously addressed climate issues, “but would if they were exposed to this knowledge.” The only criteria for the work Cape Farewell commissions, Buckland says, is that it not be “a sermon.” He says, “If we stray from that, and it starts to look like propaganda or it starts to look preachy, then we stop.” </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Photography is “an extraordinary language,” he says, but the medium is limiting because it is “very much about the here and now.” As a self-described “lens-based artist,” Buckland feels that, unlike poets or writers who can describe a vision of the future, photographers face a challenge if they want to create something more evocative than “a catalogue of disasters.” </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The lens-based works in Carbon 14 that Buckland believes were most successful include Canadian photojournalist <a href="http://donaldweber.com/">Donald Weber’s</a> show at the ROM, <a href="http://www.capefarewellfoundation.com/carbon14/quniqjuk-qunbuq-quabaa/">“Quniqjuk, Qunbuq, Quabaa.”</a> Inspired by filmmaker <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/209319/Robert-Flaherty">Robert Flaherty’s</a> 1930s portraits of Inuits lit by lamps burning whale oil, Weber asked Inuits to pose for portraits lit only by the glow from their mobile phones and iPads. Prints were mounted on 4-x-6-foot sheets of aluminum faced with Plexiglas. Buckland calls the series “passionate, atmospheric,” while also illustrative of the vast and rapid spread of technology. Weber, who participated in the Toronto retreat, is currently working with Cape Farewell to find funding for an expedition on the Mackenzie River, and to plan an installation of the stills and video he will produce.  </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also shown at the ROM was Mexican artist <a href="http://www.irational.org/minerva/resume.html">Minerva Cuevas’s</a> video <em><a href="http://www.capefarewellfoundation.com/carbon14/a-draught-of-the-blue/">A Draught of the Blue</a></em>, about a protest over the deterioration of a coral reef off the coast of Quintana Roo, Mexico, which threatens the livelihood of local residents. Inspired by a Cape Farewell retreat, Toronto-based artist <a href="http://popularunrest.org/">Melanie Gilligan</a> and London-based writer Tom Ackers collaborated on <em><a href="http://www.capefarewellfoundation.com/carbon14/deep-time/">Deep Time</a></em>, a multi-screen installation that was shown at the ROM, online and on public video screens. Buckland calls it “a very smart look at the mineral trade,” mixing film, animation and narration. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Buckland says of <a href="http://gideonmendel.com/drowningworld/">“Drowning World,”</a> a long-term project by London-based photographer <a href="http://gideonmendel.com/">Gideon Mendel</a> on people coping with flooding in Nigeria, Thailand, England, Germany and elsewhere, “He’s dealing with floods, but he’s not just looking at a place full of water. They’re portraits. It’s a human story, and that’s where photography can be interesting.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>During Carbon 14, “Drowning World” was shown on screens in shopping centers across Canada, thanks to a partnership between <a href="http://www.pattisononestop.com/">Pattison Onestop</a>, an outdoor advertising company, and Cape Farewell. Sykes notes that many of the artists Cape Farewell works with “are interested in outlets outside that white cube” of traditional exhibition spaces. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Photographer Donald Weber calls Cape Farewell “a great organization.” He says he enjoyed the Carbon 14 retreat and adds, “I also like that serious funding and money was sought for the work we wanted to do.”  Buckland notes, however, “We’re always desperately short of funding.” Partnerships with festivals and arts organizations around the world who ask Cape Farewell to contribute programming help extend the reach of the work Cape Farewell supports. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Buckland says that in recent years, Cape Farewell has moved from gathering proof that man-made climate change is real—“Climate change is a fact,” he states—to working with organizations trying to find solutions. This year, for example, the <a href="http://www.tidallagoonswanseabay.com/">Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay Ltd.</a>, which wants to harness the tides off the Welsh coast to generate electric power, asked Cape Farewell to hold an open call for proposals for sculptures and art to be installed on the grounds of the future power station. Buckland says roughly 300 entries were submitted from around the world.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Real change in the way we consume, use technology, and treat the environment requires “a cultural shift” that encompasses “the way we construct societies,” Buckland says. Speaking from Cape Farewell’s office housed in the University of London, Buckland says he’s encouraged that young artists he meets are interested in making relevant work that spurs action or discussion. “They don’t just want to make objects that have value in the market,” he says. “It’s a different measure of what it means to be an artist. I find that exciting.”</div>]]></article_text>

<div>Forced by his art school debts to move back into his parents’ house last year, photographer Damon Casarez came up with an idea for a project that has jump-started his career: a series of portraits of other twenty-somethings who had to move back in with their parents because of crushing debts and limited job opportunities.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“After being home on my parents’ couch for a month, the idea hit me and I knew this was something thousands of other people were going through,” Casarez told <em>PDN</em> in an e-mail interview. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He pitched the idea to <em>The New York Times Magazine</em>, and landed an assignment to travel around the country shooting environmental portraits of other so-called “boomerang kids.” <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/22/magazine/its-official-the-boomerang-kids-wont-leave.html?_r=0">The story</a> ran online and on the cover of the magazine’s June 22 edition, “attracting a lot of press, meetings, and a couple of portrait jobs so far,” he says.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Casarez graduated in 2012 from Art Center College of Design in Pasadena with $120,000 in debt. For about 18 months, he worked as a photographer’s assistant and sought his own assignments, but his loan payments were twice the cost of his rent. When his assisting work hit a slow period, “I couldn’t make it on my own anymore,” he says.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Moving back in with his parents felt embarrassing, he says, but he kept his optimism and saw it as a chance to “pay off some bills and devote some time to personal projects.” Then he got the idea to photograph others in the same predicament, and he began reaching out to friends to find subjects. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>One of the first was Jacqueline Boubion, the sister of a friend who lived in Casarez’s neighborhood. The shoot “went great,” Casarez says. He photographed Boubion at her parents’ formal dining table, which she had turned into her temporary desk.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>She appears out of place and uncomfortable, and the image set the tone for the entire project. Casarez says moving back in with your parents after college inspires “the feeling of being out of place and being stuck there.” His goal was to capture that feeling in his images so viewers could immediately see it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In search of other subjects, Casarez recalls, “I went straight to Craigslist, posting ads in the Gigs section with a brief description of the project.” In no time, he got “great responses” and shot three strong portraits, which he started e-mailing to magazines without mentioning that he still lived at home. “I wanted to be seen as a professional, not just a recent college grad who was broke and making a story about it,” he says.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He got a quick response from <em>The New York Times Magazine</em> photo editor Amy Kellner, who asked him to keep the project under wraps until she could pitch it to other editors at the magazine. “I’m interested in youth culture issues, and I liked that his photos had so much detail and told a story. You can look and learn a lot about the [subjects],” Kellner says. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Casarez notes that the homes of the subjects were as important to the images “as the people themselves. Showing them in an environment that was not their own, or having traces of their past lives was key.” For instance, his portrait of Robert Shane Ellis holding a Spiderman action figure in his childhood bedroom “had all the visual aspects I was looking for,” Casarez says.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Kellner soon called Casarez back with an assignment to travel around the country to make more portraits. He began scouring the Internet and placing ads on Craigslist in search of subjects all over the country. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“We wanted it to be pretty wide-ranging with their ages, loan amounts, locations, gender, etc.,” Casarez says. Kellner said the magazine wanted college grads with all types of degrees, not just arts degrees. “We wanted to show that [the job market] is hard in all different kinds of industries,” she says.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Casarez ended up taking four trips, shooting five subjects in New York City, one in the San Francisco area, two on a trip to Nebraska and Chicago, and several more during a six-day trip to Minnesota, North Carolina, Florida and Texas.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He screened subjects over the telephone, asking about their majors, their career goals, and their reasons for moving back home after graduating. “I wanted to have people in the project like myself, who were pursuing [goals]” despite financial setbacks, he says. “I knew right away if they were a good fit or not.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Casarez asked potential subjects about their home life, hobbies and daily routines to help him figure out how he might photograph them once he arrived at their houses. “I see these portraits as collaborations. They have to give me something to work with,” he says. “I just have to ask enough questions to find out what that is.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He often prompted subjects by describing what his own experience living at home was like. Talking with Annie Kasinecz, Casarez recounts, he described how he’d fallen back into his role as a teenager, with assigned chores around the house. He then asked her, “Is there anything like that with your living situation?” She told him about having to clean the yard and rake leaves, which he ended up photographing. (Casarez also shot a more directed image of Kasinecz eating a bowl of cereal for the magazine cover.)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In some cases, Casarez spent several hours figuring out what to shoot. “One of my favorite images is of Mikey Billings,” he says, referring to an image of a young man in his bedroom watching a YouTube video on how to tie a bowtie. “I was struggling a bit to come up with how I was going to photograph him,” Casarez says. “I was worried I was running out of time, so I kept asking more questions.” </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Casarez finally asked him about the kinds of jobs he applied for and what he wore to the interviews. Billings mentioned always having to watch a YouTube video to remind himself how to tie a bowtie. “That became the shot,” Casarez says, describing it as a “happy accident.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Casarez shot the portraits using a Nikon D800 “with mostly a 35mm lens and sometimes a 50mm,” he says. He also traveled with “a very basic light kit” including two ARRI Fresnels and two Lowel Tota-lights. In New York and Los Angeles, where he had access to rental equipment, he also rented Kino Flo lights. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“The lighting added a very cinematic quality to the photographs, sometimes looking like film stills,” Casarez says, adding, “I enjoy lighting like a cinematographer might, where they are adding to what is already there with the ambient and practical lights in the room.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He says the story “turned out way bigger than I could ever imagine.” It grew from an assignment to shoot a photo essay to a feature story, then to a cover story and multimedia piece (Adam Davidson wrote <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/22/magazine/its-official-the-boomerang-kids-wont-leave.html">the text</a>, and the <em>Times</em> assigned others to record interviews with the subjects). The story was on the <em>Times’s</em> list of most e-mailed stories “for a couple of days,” Casarez says, and it generated more than 1,600 comments and 2,500 Facebook shares. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><em>The Today Show </em>ended up using the magazine story as a hook for its own story about boomerang kids; they invited Davidson and Kasinecz, the subject of the cover photo. Casarez has been interviewed about the story on a number of websites, as well as on a TV talk show hosted by a CBS affiliate in San Francisco. The project has also helped him get meetings with other potential clients to show his portfolio.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Meanwhile, he’s making plans to expand the project into a book and exhibition, and trying to figure out how to land grants to help fund it. “I think there is a lot of room for the project to grow,” he says.</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>For more than a decade, photographer <a href="http://www.johnbweller.com/">John Weller</a> has been a central figure in the effort to protect what many believe is one of the last pristine, intact ocean ecosystems in the world: Antarctica’s Ross Sea. With ecologist <a href="http://assets1.thelastocean.co.nz/assets/Weller_COTW_Spring_2011.pdf">Dr. David Ainley</a>, Weller co-founded <a href="http://lastocean-project.org/">The Last Ocean</a>, an organization that is working to protect the Ross Sea from commercial fishing and other human exploitation. Among other efforts, Weller has contributed his images and writing to help many non-governmental organizations with their own conservation initiatives; spoken in front of representatives from the 26 nations and nation states that form the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (<a href="https://www.ccamlr.org/">CCAMLR</a>); helped organize a symposium that produced the first scientific report urging the designation of the Ross Sea as a Marine Protected Area; and published a book, <em><a href="http://www.rizzoliusa.com/book.php?isbn=9780847841233">The Last Ocean</a></em> (Rizzoli, 2013). </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Weller is currently editing a documentary film that he hopes to screen at the next CCAMLR meeting in October. And he recently sent a copy of his book and a large print to Vladimir Putin in “a personal plea” to the Russian leader to include his country in the group of nations that have already agreed the Ross Sea should be protected. “We’ve been pushing forward in as many creative ways as we can,” Weller told <em>PDN</em> in July from his home in Boulder, Colorado.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The biggest threat facing the Ross Sea, a bay in the Southern Ocean protected by a massive sheet of floating ice, is New Zealand’s growing commercial fishery there. The fishermen catch toothfish, sold as Chilean sea bass, which are the largest predators in this sea. Their removal would have huge consequences for the ecosystem, scientists say.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It was a paper Ainley wrote in 2004 outlining the threat to the Ross Sea that inspired Weller to take up this cause. A mutual friend connected the two, and Weller and Ainley, who has studied Ad&eacute;lie penguins in the Antarctic for more than 40 years, decided to “tell this story together and work together,” Weller recalls.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Weller published his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Sand-Dunes-National-Park/dp/1565795148">first project</a> on Great Sand Dunes National Park in southern Colorado in 2004. While there he had witnessed a group of ranchers and conservationists working together to protect the area, which relies on an aquifer that was under threat from a private landowner. Weller was struck that a politically diverse group of people had come together to protect the aquifer. He wanted to tell another, similar story, and to be a part of the process this time rather than just an observer. That’s when he read Ainley’s paper. “I started with the idea that I wanted to be a driver of this type of conservation, where we had a place worth more alive than dead under attack, and I wanted to tell the story in a way that people really understood what was at stake,” Weller recalls.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He put together a proposal to document the Ross Sea and reached out to all of the scientists working there to introduce himself and ask for guidance. “I knew I was barking up the right tree because within about 48 hours I had positive responses from everybody.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He got to work reading as much as he could get his hands on. And he began fundraising for his first trip to the Ross Sea, which he estimated would cost $60,000. He started with friends and people in his community in Boulder. Then he got a boost from an experienced fundraiser who introduced him to her contacts. Another big break came in 2006, when he cold-called <a href="http://www.quarkexpeditions.com/">Quark Expeditions</a>, a company that leads tours to the Arctic and Antarctic, and was offered passage on an icebreaker that was traveling to the Ross Sea.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Weller realized in early 2005 that he would need to shoot underwater to tell the story. He reached out to photographer <a href="http://billcurtsingerphoto.com/">Bill Curtsinger</a>, who had worked in the Arctic, for guidance, then spent three-and-a-half years accumulating more than 500 dive hours in order to get his scientific dive license. Weller went through “several years” of proposals with the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</a> before he got the green light to spend a season in 2008-2009 diving at McMurdo Station, a U.S. research facility on Ross Island. “Every dive, it was very palpable how much of an honor this was to be able to go under the ice,” Weller recalls.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The images Weller created both above and below the ice of the Ross Sea depict a vast, harsh-but-beautiful ecosystem that is habitat to a variety of species, from Ad&eacute;lie and emperor penguins and killer and minke whales to Weddell seals, fish, anemone and starfish. He wanted to highlight the “incredible adaptations the animals have to thrive” and the “functioning of the ice shelf, how it affects the global ocean,” he recalls. He produced more than 140,000 images, yet says he “captured just the very tip of what I saw.” </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Since Rizzoli published his book last year, he’s been able to hand copies to delegates from the 26 nations and nation states that attend the annual CCAMLR summits, where conservation policy for the Southern Ocean is determined. Weller has also been “feeding imagery and content” to NGOs that are campaigning for the protection of the Ross Sea. “I’m really proud to say that my images have been the center of their campaigns,” Weller says.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>With Ainley, he raised funding to bring the top scientists working in the Ross Sea to the <a href="http://www.conbio.org/mini-sites/imcc-2014">International Marine Conservation Congress</a>, where they produced “a 110-page paper detailing the state of knowledge in the Ross Sea, and signed a letter about why this [toothfish] fishery was a danger.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Weller also convinced New Zealand-based documentary filmmaker Peter Young to join the cause, and helped fund Young’s first trip to the Ross Sea. Young’s film, <em><a href="http://www.lastocean.org/">The Last Ocean</a></em>, has won numerous awards. Young also founded the <a href="http://www.lastocean.org/About-Us/David-Ainley-John-Weller-Peter-Young-__I.356">Last Ocean Charitable Trust in New Zealand</a>.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Weller says the idea for a marine-protected area was raised at the CCAMLR convention in 2012, but has yet to be resolved. At the 2013 convention, Weller presented his work to all of the delegates. This year, he hopes, the nations will reach an agreement, and he plans to present his own film.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He and his wife recently welcomed a baby daughter. While previously he had “intellectually understood that this was about future generations and leaving a better world than we inherited,” Weller says, “all of a sudden I was fighting for my daughter, and that changed everything emotionally.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For Weller, the path from documentarian to advocate has been “an outgrowth of actual good reporting. And if you really report the context of this story, to me it is just supremely obvious that we shouldn’t be fishing there.”</div>]]></article_text>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div><a href="http://www.greggarry.com/">Greg Garry</a> has been photo director at <em><a href="http://www.out.com/">Out</a> </em>magazine since 2012, and also works as a freelance art director, stylist and writer. After college he embarked on a career in TV and film, working for Sesame Street, MTV and VH1 as well as on several independent films before he moved into magazine publishing. He has created and assigned photography for many pop culture titles, including <em>Wallpaper*, HomeStyle, O, the Oprah Magazine, Flaunt, Budget Living, Radar</em> and <em>Complex</em>. He talked to <em>PDN</em> about assigning photography for <em>Out</em>, and how all his creative projects fit together.  </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>PDN: What’s the editorial mission of <em>Out</em>, and what role does photography play in the magazine? </strong></div>
        <div><strong>Greg Garry:</strong> <em>Out</em> magazine is a gay men’s fashion and pop culture magazine, kind of like <em>GQ</em> but with a gay slant. We cover fashion, politics, culture, health, gay, lesbian and transgender issues. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Photography is our best foot forward. We assign almost all of it. The majority of what I assign is beautiful portraits of celebrities, models, designers. We shoot a fair amount of fashion, both for the feature well and the front of the book. We have several still lifes in the front of the book, including accessories and some food and drink. Sometimes I’ll do a photo-illustrative still life to set a mood or illustrate a point. We did <a href="http://www.out.com/news-opinion/2013/09/09/hiv-prevention-new-condom-truvada-pill-prep">a story</a> about the new drug, Truvada, an HIV medication that people are using as prophylactic AIDS prevention. I assigned <a href="http://gregbroom.com/">Greg Broom</a> to shoot a condom wrapper with a pill exploding out of it. We did a story on gay TV, and <a href="http://www.jeffminton.com/">Jeff Minton</a> photographed <a href="http://www.jeffminton.com/STILL-LIFE/1/">a TV dripping in pink paint.</a> </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>PDN: Are you using a regular stable of contributors? </strong></div>
        <div><strong>GG: </strong>Part of the fun for me is to find new people. I don’t understand when photo editors don’t take meetings. It would be extremely boring for me if I just had contract photographers and called the same two people every month. Why have a photo editor? In that case, have a robot do it. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>I’ve been in the business a long time, so there are a stable of people I know and trust, and I will go after the big guns for a big story. But the joy of it is to foster new talent, to pull in new people. They have fresh eyes, and they’re not jaded. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>If they’ve had a fair amount of photo experience and they’ve shot bigger stories and you can see from the portfolio that they “get it,” then you can tell that they’ll do a good job. But most times, first you give them a smaller portrait or a front-of-the-book fashion shoot, then once you trust them you try them on a bigger well story.</div>
        <div> </div>
        <div><strong>PDN: What qualities do you need to see in a photographer’s work before you trust him or her with an assignment? </strong></div>
        <div><strong>GG: </strong>I tend to look for a few things. Lighting is most important. In the digital age some people think they can forget about lighting and fix it in post, but I like to see beautiful light captured in camera. Also I look for interesting framing. Some photographers just have a warped vision, so the way they frame a photo is interesting. Someone like <a href="http://www.chrisbuck.com/main.html">Chris Buck</a> will frame things in an interesting way and other photographers wouldn’t do it that way. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>I tend to go with someone who has a sense of humor and an energy to their photos. It depends on the story whether that fits or not. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Originality: Something you haven’t seen before, or someone who is shooting things in a way you haven’t seen before. I tend to see a ton of nudes in portfolios. People will photograph a naked person against a wall and think that’s enough to make it interesting. But nudes have been done throughout the history of photography. So if you don’t have an interesting take on it, a naked person is not enough, I’m afraid. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>PDN: Do you like to meet with photographers first? </strong></div>
        <div><strong>GG:</strong> Sometimes I don’t have that luxury. This week I had shoots in Belgium and in Hawaii. I shoot a lot in Paris and London and don’t have the budget to meet photographers there. I quietly stalk them online. I have many, many websites bookmarked on my computer and I have them organized by location. I can say, ok, this person is doing great work in Paris, so when the perfect shoot comes up, I assign them. You get an idea of their career and capabilities. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>I also have a network of other photo editors and art buyers. We help each other out. That’s one of the benefits of Facebook— it’s a canvassing tool, and it helps you find photographers all over the world. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>I do like to meet with photographers. You can sense if their personalities will jibe with a photo shoot. But of course the work is number one. I’ve been known to work with difficult photographers if I liked their work. Not as much as in the old days. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>PDN: We hear that a lot: “In the old days, you could be a jerk, but not any more.” </strong></div>
        <div><strong>GG:</strong> In the old days, bad behavior was encouraged, I think. When I first started out it seemed like everyone was doing drugs and drinking on shoots, and the days would stretch until midnight. Now we just want to get the work done and go home. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>PDN: Are there assignments you’ve worked on recently that you’re particularly proud of? </strong></div>
        <div><strong>GG:</strong> My favorite recent assignment was for the June issue, photographing <a href="http://www.out.com/entertainment/movies/2014/05/27/robert-de-niro-me-my-gay-dad?page=full">Robert De Niro</a>. That was a dream come true and the first time I’d been nervous around a celebrity in a long time. I was reading about the Sundance Film Festival and saw that he had directed a documentary about his gay father. A few months later, I read that HBO had bought the rights. We have a close working relationship with HBO. I called the PR department, and they said he’s available Tuesday. I called <a href="http://www.platonphoto.com/">Platon</a>. He was on my wish list of people to work with. So this was a dream subject and a dream photographer. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>We met at Robert’s father’s studio which is filled with his personal belongings and all of his paintings. He was totally down to earth and nice, and the shoot was quick. Then the story blew up. It was one of our most popular stories online. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>One of the tasks that nearly kills me every year is the <a href="http://www.out.com/out-exclusives/out100-2013"><em>Out</em> 100</a>. I’m gearing up for the next one, catching up on sleep, taking my vitamins. It’s like going to war. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>I get one photographer to shoot the entire portfolio: 100 people in multiple locations. We shoot in studios but also in homes, offices, bars. We’re currently discussing who will be in the 100 and the right photographer. Last year <a href="http://daniellelevitt.com/">Danielle Levitt</a> shot it. The year before it was shot by <a href="http://www.msharkey.com/">M Sharkey</a>, and the year before that it was <a href="http://www.gavinbondphotography.com/">Gavin Bond</a>. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>PDN: What’s the division of labor at <em>Out</em> for assigning photography? </strong></div>
        <div><strong>GG:</strong> Are you asking: Do I have a massive staff? No. I have a great assistant photo editor, Gabriela Landazuri. Gabriela helps with the research for the front of the book and on smaller photo productions. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>PDN: Do you care if a photographer is known for regularly shooting for another magazine? </strong></div>
        <div><strong>GG:</strong> If someone is the right photographer and I want them, I’m not going to get pissy if they shoot for <em>Details</em> or some other men’s magazine. There’s so little work out there, it’s not nice to do that. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>PDN: Do you try to hire photographers who are in the LGBT community? </strong></div>
        <div><strong>GG: </strong>Not necessarily. There’s no affirmative action. I try to be supportive of the community but I don’t try to base [my selection] solely on that. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>PDN: How do you usually find photographers? </strong></div>
        <div><strong>GG: </strong>I follow a lot of photography Tumblrs. I look at photography blogs, and <em>PDN</em>, especially <em>PDN</em>’s 30—not to kiss your ass—and other magazines. I tend to look at smaller European fashion magazines, because those photographers are doing it for the love of photography. I have a good reputation with photographers so they send other photographers to me, especially when they’re in New York from out of town. I’m like the Statue of Liberty, they all want to see me. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>PDN: What is your reputation? </strong></div>
        <div><strong>GG: </strong>I think I’m fair and fun to work with and you get good work out of me. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>PDN: What is the freelance work that you do?</strong> </div>
        <div><strong>GG:</strong> I do my own advertising stuff on the side. I did an ad for Kmart that was only on Instagram, which is a little bizarre to me but that’s where the kids are going; they’re not looking at print or TV any more. I did a few ads and websites for liquor companies. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>I have both hired photographers to do ad and e-commerce shoots, and been brought in by photographers to work on their shoots. I’m usually brought in by photographers because I’ve worked with them editorially; then when they get an ad [or e-commerce] shoot, they bring me in to style it for them and art direct. I also write for <em>Out</em>, <em>Candy</em> (a trans fashion magazine out of Spain), and other publications. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>PDN: How do all the creative things you do fit together? </strong></div>
        <div><strong>GG: </strong>It’s all telling stories. Words tell stories, photos tell stories. I like going in with a blank slate and seeing if magic happens. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>PDN: What do you wish photographers understood better about magazines, or about your roles? </strong></div>
        <div><strong>GG:</strong> The best thing for photographers to do is keep on shooting and honing their esthetic and becoming as good and original as they can be, and then photo editors and art directors will find them. If you shoot cool projects and keep people aware of them, I still believe talent will rise to the top. I think that’s our job: to match that talent to the right stories and make it as easy as possible for them to create art. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>PDN: You believe a photo made on assignment can be art? </strong></div>
        <div><strong>GG:</strong> It can be. You don’t have to be pedantic about that, but make something new. Though I’ve been going into studio shoots every day since God was a boy, it’s still exciting to me. The potential for greatness is always there. Never get jaded: I think that’s good advice for everyone.</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>A tortoise named Jonathan who is rumored to have met every governor of St. Helena since arriving on the island in 1882. A prison that from time to time serves as a video shop. A lollipopseller awarded a Badge of Honor for maintaining calm under duress. A police officer who has been on duty for 22 years without making an arrest, yet serves as the only law enforcement officer for a territory of 1750 square miles. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>These are just some of the people, places and things indexed in <a href="http://www.jontonks.com/">Jon Tonks’</a> book <em><a href="http://www.dewilewis.com/products/empire">Empire</a></em> (Dewi Lewis). A catalogue of the remaining British colonies, Tonks’ book provides a glimpse, with typical British humor, of the characters you might come across if you washed ashore from a shipwreck on St. Helena, Ascension Island, Tristan da Cunha or the Falkland Islands. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Tonks began the project as a student pursuing his MA in Photojournalism &amp; Documentary Photography at the London College of Communication. He’d been working as a staff photographer at a Birmingham newspaper when he realized he’d “just had enough” and took out a loan to go back to school. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“As part of the course, we were required to create a body of work,” Tonks tells <em>PDN</em>. “I’d always wanted my project to have a bit of a British theme to it. There was a certain sense of humor I felt I could work with, and find a balance between that and more serious documentary work. I wanted to create a body of work that represented this sort of British-ness.” </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The idea for Empire grew from a desire to leave home and explore; it was the same lust for travel that had inspired Tonks to become a photographer in the first place. Wanting to leave England yet also wanting a British-themed subject, Tonks started looking into the remaining bits of the British Empire: the islands in the middle of nowhere to which England clings. Tonks realized that, aside from <a href="http://www.jontonks.com/portfolio/falkland-islands/#1">the Falkland Islands</a>, he really had no clue what any of them looked like. <a href="http://www.jontonks.com/portfolio/ascension-island/#1">Ascension Island</a> was the first to intrigue him. Although the tiny island in the middle of the southern Atlantic is British, it has a “sort of co-owned relationship with the US, including a military base,” for strategic reasons, he explains. The people who live there have no right of abode, meaning that even if they were born there, they have no legal right to live on the island, only to work. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“I wondered what that community would look like,” Tonks recalls. “I decided to fly out and spend a month investigating to see what would happen.” </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Tonks’s deadpan humor lends an inviting informality to the formally composed, medium-format images. “It was quite a fine balance I found,” Tonks says. “I don’t take myself too seriously, but at the same time it was always important that none of the imagery was derogatory towards anybody. I think if you enjoy the work you see, you ultimately absorb it better as well.” </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Tonks felt the book would be stronger with captions. “For me it was always really important that each image had a good story with it,” he says. “Otherwise it’s just a book of pictures.” His editing process centered on matching strong images with equally strong tales, and if one side were lacking he would often cut the image from the book. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Tonks funded the project “by hook or by crook.” He felt he had to “go for it” even if that meant going further into debt after getting the loan for his MA, so he paid for his first trip to Ascension Island with money he made from any commercial gigs he could get his hands on, including weddings, and put the rest on credit cards. <em>The Sunday Times</em> later bought his images from <a href="http://www.jontonks.com/portfolio/tristan-da-cunha/#1">Tristan da Cunha</a>, which helped pay for that trip. While on <a href="http://www.jontonks.com/portfolio/st-helena-2/#1">St. Helena</a>, he brokered gigs photographing all of the islands’ bars and social venues for the local tourist board in exchange for housing for the eight days he would be there.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After entering some of the work in the <a href="http://awards.the-aop.org/">Association of Photographers Awards</a>, he began a conversation with publisher Dewi Lewis, who was one of the awards judges. They exchanged PDFs for about a year, Tonks says, then went into production. “I paid for the book. I’m not in this to make money, am I?” he laughs while explaining that Kickstarter or other crowdfunding options held little appeal for him. Paying for production out of his own pocket gave him a great deal of control over the design of the final object. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>While editing the book, Tonks was startled to check his email one day and find a message from photographer <a href="http://www.martinparr.com/">Martin Parr</a>. “I think he was intrigued about how I’d gotten into these different places, and as it happens I live in Bath and he lives in Bristol, so I just drove over and had a cup of tea and explained it all. He’s been really wonderful and open about offering advice.” </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The book sold out its first print run, prompting a second printing due to be released this month. But Tonks seems to keep things in perspective. He says he’d be most “chuffed if in a hundred years somebody pulls it out of the library somewhere and it gets used as a reference point.”</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div>There are myriad reasons photographers choose to self-publish their books. Some want full creative control over their work or find it hard to convince traditional publishers to take a chance on a project. Others like the challenge of producing a book, whether it’s offset-printed or created entirely by hand in a special edition. PDN spoke with three photographers who’ve recently self-published to discuss their motivations and creative processes.  </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>Ben Huff ’s <em>The Last Road North </em></strong></div>
        <div>As a photographer living in Alaska, far removed from nearly all of the museums, galleries and cultural institutions that show photography in the United States, <a href="http://www.ben-huff.com/">Ben Huff</a> says photo books are “everything” to him. When he began his series documenting the northernmost highway in his home state, it was natural for him to think of it as a book project. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Huff’s <em>The Last Road North</em> will be released later this year in a <a href="http://www.ben-huff.com/shop/book-pre-order">trade edition</a> published by Kehrer Verlag, but Huff also chose to self-publish a <a href="http://www.ben-huff.com/shop/artist-book">handmade artist’s book</a> in an edition of 12, which he is selling for $700. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>As a photographer promoting his first major project, Huff didn’t know whether a publisher would offer to release his monograph, so part of the motivation to self-publish was simply to finish the project. “Whether it was one, two or five [copies], I wanted to have this final thing that I constructed and that took some physical-ness to make,” he explains. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>He also felt that “the only way that I was going to work out the sequence and the edit and the overall feel that I wanted was to put it on the page and make this object that I always dreamed of having.” To learn to make the book, Huff studied <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hand-Bookbinding-A-Manual-Instruction/dp/048629157X">Hand Bookbinding: A Manual of Instruction</a> by Aldren A. Watson, watched YouTube tutorials, and examined the photography books in his collection. Looking at the construction of a favorite book rather than the images “was a completely different way of considering that object,” he says. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>After some fits and starts and experimentation, he settled on a way of making his books that he was happy with. “These, right down to the hand-drawn map, are the best objects that I can make as a photographer, as an artist. I don’t believe that they’re perfect, but they’re 100 percent unique,” he says. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The materials alone for each book cost him more than $100, and the process of making the books takes three days, he says. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>At press time, Huff had sold a handful of copies to collectors and institutions, including the University of Fairbanks, by reaching out to them personally. He was actively promoting the book to rare book libraries as well. Money from the sales of the special edition will help cover the investment Kehrer Verlag asked him to make in the production of the trade edition of his book. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The self-published version of <em>The Last Road North</em> also helped Huff secure his deal with Kehrer. He took one of his hand-made books to the <a href="http://www.photolucida.org/portfolio-reviews/">Photolucida portfolio reviews</a> in 2013, where he showed it to publishers, including Alexa Becker, Kehrer’s acquisitions editor. Having a finished book that he was completely happy with helped him approach the portfolio reviews with confidence, he says. During Photolucida, Huff and Becker connected and agreed to work together at the reviews. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>A photo book collector himself, with a great appreciation for the physical objects of books, Huff wanted to make something that would look at home among the books on his shelf. “It was exciting to believe that I could make something that I could slide in between two of my favorite books, that I put on a pedestal, and say, ‘Those, physically, look similar.’” </div>

        <div><a href="http://www.petervanagtmael.net/">Peter van Agtmael’s</a> second book, <em><a href="http://www.petervanagtmael.net/#/buy-disco-night-sept-11">Disco Night Sept. 11</a></em>, is almost a steal for a photo book with 188 images and over 276 pages, including 19 gatefolds. The price is $45 for early-bird buyers, $55 for those buying up the middle of the print run, and $60 for those purchasing any of the last 500 copies. For a special edition with a slipcase and a signed 8 x 10 print, the cost is $250. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The book’s size and affordability were possible only because van Agtmael self-published the book through <a href="http://redhookeditions.com/">Red Hook Editions</a>, the imprint he started in 2012 with photographers <a href="http://jasoneskenazi.com/">Jason Eskenazi</a> and <a href="http://www.alanschin.com/">Alan Chin</a>. (Red Hook Editions has also published two of Eskanazi’s books to date.) </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“I’m guessing with [another] publisher the book would have had a significantly higher price tag, which would have made it cost-prohibitive for most people and outside the spirit of a book of journalism,” van Agtmael said in an e-mail interview. He <a href="https://squareup.com/market/peter-van-agtmael/disco-night-sept">released the book</a> this past spring. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“As a result of cutting out all the middlemen, I can sell the book for a reasonable price. The production was quite expensive and I worried it would be cost-prohibitive for a lot of buyers if the final price had to support a massive back end”—i.e., a publishing house with high overhead. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Of course, more established photo book publishers have brand cachet and distribution networks that Red Hook Editions lacks, but van Agtmael, a member of <a href="http://www.magnumphotos.com/">Magnum Photos</a>, says he can partly make up for that by tapping into Magnum’s sizable mailing list and fan base. And he says that his decision to self-publish wasn’t only about keeping down the final price of the book. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“I wanted to have full decision capability over every aspect of the production,” he said. “I worked on this project for nearly eight years and ultimately wanted to have final creative control.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><em>Disco Night Sept. 11</em> explores the disconnect between the violent realities of America’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the perceptions—and confusion—about those wars here at home. Van Agtmael covered the wars between 2006 and 2013, often embedded with US military units. (He won the 2009 Photolucida Critical Mass prize, which included publication of his first monograph, <em><a href="http://www.photolucida.org/2nd-tour-hope-i-dont-die/">2nd Tour Hope I Don’t Die</a>.</em>) </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><em>Disco Night</em> “is meant to be layered, but also accessible. Personally, I’ve always been angry about how simple our cultural understanding of war is. This book is meant to challenge a lot of those assumptions.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Although van Agtmael self-published the book, it wasn’t exactly a DIY project. Production was “a massive collaborative effort” with designer <a href="http://www.yocuomo.com/#/home">Yolanda Cuomo</a>, photographer <a href="http://bonniebriant.com/">Bonnie Briant</a>, “and dozens of photographers and writers whom I sought guidance from. The point wasn’t to work in a vacuum, but to have final say.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>He met Cuomo through her work for Magnum and Aperture, and says her expertise was indispensable to the project: “She knows all the publishing houses, the papers, binding, cover textures, stamping and embossing techniques—in short, everything about the process. I didn’t know much, but I know what I like.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>To fund production and printing, van Agtmael raised $60,000 by dipping into his own savings and borrowing from family and friends. He didn’t attempt to get a bank loan. “I thought it would be too much of a pain in the ass,” he says. He also decided not to try to raise money with a Kickstarter campaign because “I didn’t want to get bogged down with sending out a lot of different rewards.” But in retrospect, he says, a Kickstarter campaign might be worth the effort because it builds a following of people with “more of an emotional stake in the process.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Most of the money went toward printing the book, which had a print run of 2,000 copies. Van Agtmael says separations, printing and shipping totaled about $40,000—about $20 per copy. Although he could have saved money by having the book printed in China, where printing costs are particularly low, he decided to work with <a href="http://www.graphicom.it/">Graphicom</a>, a Vincenza, Italy-based printer, “because of their deep experience, fast turnaround, and excellent proofs,” he says. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“I didn’t compromise on anything, which was why the cost-per- book was so high,” he says. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The remaining $20,000 of van Agtmael’s budget went toward building a website, storage space, travel expenses to Italy to be on press, and fees for Cuomo and for Andrea Smith, the freelance publicist hired to promote the book. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“I hired Andrea because she did so brilliantly with <a href="http://www.kamberphoto.com/">Mike Kamber’s</a> book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Photojournalists-War-Untold-Stories-Iraq/dp/0292744080">Photojournalists on War</a></em>. She also has a network of contacts that Magnum and I don’t have,” he says. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>He notes that his non-printing expenses may not have been typical, but because of his business relationships with various providers, “I was given pretty good rates,” he says, including by the designer. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><em>Disco Night Sept. 11</em> is being sold through the Red Hook Editions <a href="http://redhookeditions.com/">website</a>, as well as the <a href="http://www.magnumphotos.com/Store/Product/Disco-Night-Sept.-11-2K1HRG5YVNLJ.html">Magnum Photos Store</a>. At press time, the price was still at the $45 level. </div>

        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>Emma Phillips’s <em>SALT</em> </strong></div>
        <div>When Melbourne, Australia-based photographer <a href="http://emmaphillips.net/">Emma Phillips</a> was first thinking of turning her series of minimalist, salt mine landscapes into a book, she spoke to a couple of small publishers. She had a very specific idea about what she wanted the book to be, however, “so it seemed easier to work through the process on my own” and self-publish the book, she told PDN via email. She also felt it was “difficult” as a young photographer to approach publishers “who have no idea who you are and convince them that your work is worth their time and money.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Phillips says she didn’t think about the cachet, distribution and marketing a traditional publisher might offer her. “I just tried to make a book that reflected my vision.” She says she wasn’t even particularly concerned with whether the book would appeal to anyone beyond the photography community. “To me the important aspect of creating is to put something out in the world so that any person may experience and receive it if they wish to.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>In November of last year, Phillips released <em>SALT </em>in an edition of 500 clothbound, hardcover books of 40 pages, containing 17 color images. She is selling the book for $39.95 <a href="http://emmaphillips.bigcartel.com/product/salt">via her website</a> using the Big Cartel shopping cart app. The book is also stocked in select stores in Australia, Japan, France and the United States, including <a href="https://printedmatter.org/tables/115/36394">Printed Matter</a> in New York.  </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The challenge of self-publishing was a “logical extension” of her work, Phillips explains. “As a photographer, you’re always trying to teach yourself how to do new things … The fact that there were certain hurdles to deal with made it more interesting,” she adds. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>She had previously only made books in small editions, so part of the challenge was to figure out which printing process was best suited to her project and her goal of a larger print run. She liked books produced by Japanese publishers, so she arranged to travel to the <a href="http://reminders-project.org/?lang=en-us">Reminders Photography Stronghold</a>, a gallery and residence for photographers in Tokyo, and to attend the <a href="http://zinesmate.org/">Tokyo Art Book Fair</a>. There, she made decisions about the production values she wanted. Phillips designed her book herself. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The cost of printing in Australia was prohibitive, so she found a printer in Asia, which she admits was not “ideal, because my deadline and budget didn’t permit me to travel to oversee the production process.” Instead she communicated with the printer via email and Skype. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Because the books are offset-printed, it made sense to make 500 of them. “Once the [printing] plates are complete, it’s more economical to produce larger quantities,” she notes. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Phillips has promoted the book herself, reaching out to publications she likes, though she says most often she’s been approached by websites and blogs interested in featuring the work. <a href="http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/emma-phillips">It’s Nice That</a>, <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/behold/2014/04/20/emma_phillips_takes_simple_landscapes_of_a_salt_mine_in_her_book_salt_photos.html">Slate</a>, <a href="http://www.emahomagazine.com/2014/02/emma-phillips-salt/">Emaho Magazine</a>, <a href="http://www.monsterchildren.com/6606/">Monster Children</a> and other sites have featured <em>SALT</em>. </div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div>Photographer <strong><a href="http://www.markmannphoto.com" target="_blank">Mark Mann</a></strong> makes a living as one of the most prolific portraitists of his generation; he has photographed celebrities and athletes for an endless list of publications and advertising clients. For <em>Esquire</em>’s 80th anniversary in 2013, he captured timeless images of some of America’s greatest male creative luminaries for the yearlong “The Life of Man” project.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>While it might be hard to imagine, Mann didn’t carry his camera with him everyday until recently, when he picked up The Brixton leather messenger camera bag from ONA. Mann likes to be inconspicuous when he’s shooting outside the studio, but he finds that most sturdy camera bags are too bulky for everyday use.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Mann also likes its stylish look. “Most people don’t even know it’s a camera bag,” he says. “I take my camera with me all the time now, and that means that I take more photos.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/_MG_6023(1).jpg" /><br />
        </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>We asked Mann to empty the contents of his ONA bag to see what items he doesn’t leave the house without.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>(1) <strong>Leica M 240:</strong> When Mann isn’t in the studio with his medium-format camera, he likes to be as subtle as possible. The Leica M 240 looks like a small film camera to the untrained eye, which, Mann says, allows him more access than other full-frame digital camera. It doesn’t hurt that the image quality, according to Mann, is “unbeatable.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>(2) <strong>Leica 35mm F/2.0 Summicron M Aspherical Manual Focus Lens:</strong> The first lens in Mann’s bag is “a classic Leica lens that produces Leica’s iconic reportage photography,” says Mann. “I love it because you can see a lot in the frame, but it never forces objects to be too wide.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>(3)<strong> Leica Normal 50mm f/1.4 Summilux M Aspherical Manual Focus Lens:</strong> This lens, Mann says, “is the absolute standard for 35mm cameras. I use it when I when I want to take a photo that has a nice look without any distortion.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>(4) <strong>Leica Telephoto 75mm f/2.0 APO Summicron M Aspherical Manual Focus: </strong>“I use the 75mm when I want to get close” says Mann. “It’s a perfect lens for portraits.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>(5) <strong>2TB Glyph Studio Mini Hard Drive:</strong> Mann backs up all his data religiously to three separate locations. Not a risk-taker when it comes to his files, he carries a backup for his current hard drive in his ONA at all times.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>(6) <strong>iPad: </strong>“I like to always keep it on me in case I want to do some reading or need a moment to recharge my batteries,” Mann says.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>(7) <strong>Backup Battery Charger for iPhone/iPad:</strong> “I always have to have extra juice with me.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>(8) <strong>Lens Cleaning Kit:</strong> “I’m absolutely terrible about cleaning my lens,” confesses Mann, who says he finally decided to stop using his t-shirts and get a professional kit for his valuable gear. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>(9) <strong>License Plate for his Vespa Gran Turismo 250 Motorcycle:</strong> “[The Vespa] looks like it’s been through a war and back,” says Mann. Even so, he takes off the license plate whenever he parks, so that it won’t be stolen. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>(10) <strong>Also pictured:</strong> Bluetooth headphones, Go Pro Hero3+ (Mann documents sunrise and sunset time lapses while traveling) keys, Leica electric rangefinder, Leica battery charger, business card holder and a pair of Groucho Marx glasses (Mann jokes, “for disguise.”)</div>
        <div><br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div>Shaping light in your photo studio is an art that requires experience, a keen eye for highlights and shadows, and the right modifiers. While you may be able to keep your core lighting gear to a minimum, you can never have too many light modifiers since each one is capable of delivering a different look and feel to your images. Regardless of your photographic specialty, we think you’ll find a light modifier (or two) in this list of favorites to pique your interest and imagination. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>CHIMERA F2X LIGHTBANK </strong>(pictured above)</div>
        <div>When even the largest softbox in your studio doesn’t cut it for those big shoots, it’s time to unleash the Chimera F2X overhead lightbank. Ideal for photographing the newest Lamborghini or a classic ’57 Chevy, as well as other large objects that require long, continuous highlights and even coverage, the F2X can be set up in studio or on location. Color-coded aircraft aluminum tubing forms the super-strong but lightweight frame of the lightbank, and the entire setup can be assembled with no tools. Chimera estimates it will take two people about 2 to 3 hours to set up a 10 x 20-foot F2X model. The lightbank is available alone, with frame components, lightbank body and lid, internal baffle and shipping duffels, or in a Triolet kit with the appropriate number of lights. For example, a 5 x 10-foot F2X kit comes with two lights, while the largest, 10 x 30-foot, uses 12 lights. Other sizes include 5 x 15 and 10 x 20-foot. Not surprisingly, these lightbanks are pricey, but if you don’t want to splurge on something you might only use for specialty shoots, they are also available for rent. See the Chimera site for more information about rentals and modular versions of the lightbank. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>PRICE:</strong> From $3,600 (lightbank only) </div>

        <div><strong>K 5600 BIG EYE FRESNEL <br />
        </strong></div>
        <div>
        <div>Designed to work with K 5600’s Joker HMI lights as well as strobe lighting from other brands, the Big Eye Fresnel delivers soft, versatile light for both still photography and motion. The Big Eye is a standard, 24-inch 18K Fresnel, providing access to all the same light patterns as other 18K Fresnel fixtures. But the Big Eye’s polymer lens is unique because it accepts interchangeable light sources and folds down flat. And, at around 20 pounds, it’s a lot lighter than the typical 140-pound 18K Fresnels. An easy-to-attach (and detach) black skirt covers the setup’s wire frame and the lens edges to prevent light spill. Transitioning from 10-degree spot to 60-degree broad flood coverage requires nothing more than moving the light source farther from or closer to the lens. The Big Eye kit, which consists of the structure, lens, light center adapters, reflector, black skirt and transport bag, measures 26 x 15 inches when collapsed, so it is easily transportable for location shoots. If you’re after the look of 18K Fresnel lighting in a more portable form, the Big Eyemay be the perfect solution. </div>

        BRONCOLOR SOFTBOXES </strong></div>
        <div>Broncolor’s latest softboxes come in an assortment of shapes and sizes to fit a variety of shooting scenarios, from large-scale shoots to smaller, more targeted jobs such as product photography. Among Broncolor’s nine softbox models, you’ll find rectangular, square and striplite variations with sizes ranging from 1.1 x 2 feet and 2 x 2 feet to 3.9 x 5.9 feet. The series includes 2.5 and 4.5-foot octaboxes as well. Each softbox can be modified with up to three diffusers, one atop the other (two are bundled with each model; the third is optional). The ability to combine multiple diffusers allows photographers to fine-tune the depth and breadth of light according to need. For additional control, light grids are also available. Thanks to an array of speedrings, Broncolor softboxes are compatible with a wide range of flash units from manufacturers such as <a href="http://profoto.com/">Profoto</a>, <a href="http://www.elinchrom.us/">Elinchrom</a> and <a href="http://usa.hensel.eu/">Hensel</a>, to name a few. There’s also an adapter for flashguns, so you’re covered no matter the light source. And, thanks to color-coded struts and speedrings, setting up the softboxes is a no-brainer, even for those just starting out with studio lighting. </div>

        <div><strong>ELINCHROM SOFTLITE REFLECTOR SET </strong></div>
        <div>Elinchrom announced two Softlite 17-inch reflector sets earlier this year and they’re well suited for both portrait and commercial photography. Available in silver or white, the sets are bundled with a matching 17-inch grid and a carry bag. These parabolic “Pan” reflectors are compatible with any Elinchrom flash head and produce a slightly crisper light than a softbox while maintaining broad, even illumination. The bundled grid provides more pinpoint and sculptural control, and an optional diffuser is available when a softer light is desired. The ProTec carry bag, which protects against dents and scratches, includes a shoulder strap and an extra slot for the accompanying grid. The bag measures 23 x 9 x 22 inches and weighs 15.5 pounds when loaded with the reflector and grid. The protective bag is convenient for storage, transporting to off-site locations, and for shipping as well. </div>

        <div><strong>PHOTOFLEX LITEREACH PLUS WITH LITEPANEL KIT </strong></div>
        <div>Setting up and tearing down lightstands takes time, but if you’re in a hurry and need to place a light panel between the light and your subject, this handy little kit will do the trick. With its quick release system, the boom arm is designed for speedy setup. The four-section boom arm is constructed of aluminum and can be extended up to 9 feet 7 inches or collapsed to 35.5 inches. The LitePanel, which measures 39 x 39 inches and utilizes one-stop diffusion fabric, is equally easy to assemble and, when attached to the boom arm, provides that extra reach (and portability) that is often needed when on location or even in the studio. The device features a “balance ball” at the bottom of the pole, saving wear and tear on your assistant’s back and arms since the pole can be comfortably braced against the waist, hip or the ground. Everything you need is bundled with the kit, including a carry bag for easy transport to location shoots. </div>

        PROFOTO DEEP UMBRELLAS </strong></div>
        <div>Umbrellas are part of most photographers’ lighting kits. They’re relatively affordable, easy to store and set up and, most importantly, can help produce beautiful light. While shallow umbrellas, like those from Profoto, work well on most shoots, it’s their Deep series that provides even better control over how the light is shaped and focused. Profoto’s series of Umbrella Deep L (51-inch) and Deep XL (65-inch) models are each available in a trio of options: translucent, silver and white. The translucent model delivers the softest light of the three, while the silver produces the crispest (albeit still soft) light. The white version combines the best of both the translucent and silver models. Profoto also offers optional diffusers to further customize the Deep L and Deep XL’s lighting capabilities. </div>

        <div><strong>WESTCOTT ZEPPELIN PARABOLIC SOFTBOXES </strong></div>
        <div>Announced at this year’s WPPI, Westcott’s Zeppelin Parabolics are some of the most affordable paras on the market and are ideal for creating the kind of wrap-around illumination required for studio portrait and fashion photography. Available in three sizes (35-inch, 47-inch and 59-inch), the Zeppelin light modifiers are constructed of durable but lightweight material with a highly reflective silver interior. Outer and inner diffusion panels are bundled with the softboxes, along with a removable rear cover for extra ventilation, all the rods needed for setup, and a travel case. Mounting brackets are available for Profoto, Bowens, Balcar and Elinchrom, and while the cost of the brackets ($249 for Profoto; $199 for the others) will add to the overall price, Westcott’s Parabolics are still well within reach even for smaller studios or independent photographers. </div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[Nazraeli Press is known for producing beautiful photo books by Todd Hido, Michael Kenna, Jamey Stillings and other photographers, and for pioneering sales of limited-edition books.
<p>In <em>PDN</em>’s article “<a href="/The-Costly-Business--11311.shtml">The Costly Business of Photo Book Publishing</a>,” Nazraeli founder and publisher Chris Pichler says he has never expected a photographer to contribute to the cost of producing a book. Pichler is experienced in publishing in a variety of formats, and to different audiences, from the general public who loves photography to the committed collector. In 1998, Pichler launched <a href="http://www.nazraeli.com/one-picture-books/">One Picture Books</a>, featuring modestly sized books, printed in an edition of 500 and signed by the artist; each copy sells for $40. The Six by Six series of boxed sets, each signed and numbered and printed in an edition of 100, sell for $6,000. Most trade edition photo books, however, sell for $65 or $75.</p>
<p><em>PDN</em> talked to Pichler about the many models he follows, and what photographers should understand before publishing a photo book.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: About how many photo books does Nazraeli publish annually? What is the average print run? What percentage of list price does the average book cost to print?</strong><br />
<strong>Chris Pichler:</strong> We are currently publishing around 25 titles each year. The print runs vary from the low hundreds, for books in the One Picture Book, NZ Library and <a href="http://pdnpulse.pdnonline.com/2010/10/nazraeli-press-limited-editions-now-even-more-limited.html">Six by Six</a> series, to several thousand copies for stand-alone monographs.</p>
<p>Regarding price versus cost, the average across these titles isn't really meaningful; rather, the reasons for deciding to publish a particular book, the print run, and the retail price independent of cost, are all important considerations. But there is an old rule of thumb, which is worth noting: A production cost to retail price ratio of 1:5. The reason for this is simple, and based on traditional methods of selling books through bookstores. If a book costs $1 to print, for example, the retail price would be $5. This is because a given bookstore would receive a discount of 40 percent off the retail price, and therefore pay $3 to the publisher. If the bookseller then sold that book for $5, they would have profit margin of $2. The publisher would likewise earn $2 on that book: $3 for the price sold, minus $1 for the price paid to produce it. In this way, publishers and booksellers are equal partners.</p>
<p>All of that has changed now, and in both directions: bookstores are asking for higher discounts, but publishers are making up some of that lost ground by selling books directly for full retail price. Obviously, the more books a publisher can sell for full retail price, the more they can earn on the books, especially when the 1:5 ratio is adhered to.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Some of the books you publish appear quite specialized, and the quality is high, but the prices are mostly very competitive. How do you earn a profit on these books? For example, Todd Hido's B-Sides project: This had a very limited print run of 500, the cost is relatively low ($30), and the product appears expensive to produce. How can you take on that kind of project without sustaining a loss?</strong><br />
<strong>CP:</strong> Todd Hido's B-Sides project was an add-on to the much larger, more expensive and obviously more profitable <em><a href="/The-Prevailing-Wind-8201.shtml">Excerpts from Silver Meadows</a></em>. We published B-Sides as a little project to sell primarily at events like Paris Photo LA and Palm Springs Photo Festival, and to our end customers via our website. The purpose of publishing "B-Sides" wasn't to see how much money could be made, but rather to produce an unexpected, interesting and modest publication that is fun for people to buy and spend time with. Of course, at such a small print run we could have marketed it as a limited-edition, inherently valuable object and sold it for a lot of money to serious collectors only. But that wouldn't have been in the spirit of this particular project, and I've learned from countless experiences that it pays more—in ways that count—to be generous rather than greedy. Plus it's a lot more gratifying for all parties!</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Is there anything you wish photographers understood better about book publishing?</strong><br />
<strong>CP:</strong> I'm surprised sometimes by how many people—photographers or otherwise—imagine that all books are printed in editions of tens [of thousands] or hundreds of thousands of copies. Very, very few books, especially art books, are printed in runs that even begin to approach that figure. Our highest print runs are closer to 5,000 copies, and standard runs are closer to 1,000 copies. If a regular book sells out, it can be reprinted; there is no reason to print more than you think you can sell, unless you want to end up storing books long-term.</p>
<p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Are photographers ever given the opportunity to help fund the production of their book with Nazraeli Press? Have you had photographers raising funds on Kickstarter or elsewhere to help cover costs or increase production value/print run?</strong><br />
<strong>CP:</strong> The short answer is no: I wouldn't ask a photographer to fund a publication of their own work. If one doesn't feel that there is a viable market for a book, then one should probably ask [themselves] why it is they want to publish it in the first place. This doesn't mean that every book needs to be printed in a mass-market format, though. We have published books that I adore, which are printed in small editions (and maybe sold at very high prices) because there is a small, but very serious, market for them. All books don't have to adhere to the same set of rules. But if I can't see selling a book in a standard print run, to a combination of bookstores, galleries, libraries and individuals—and if it's not the right kind of work for a small-run, more "collectible" edition—then I would be ignoring common sense if I were to publish it.</p>
<p>Sometimes I may be proved wrong, but in the long run, you have to make these decisions based on your own experiences and instincts, and remind yourself why you're doing this in the first place.</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>When New York City-based photographer <a href="http://www.michelleroyphoto.com/">Michel Leroy</a> was trying to transition from assisting, he struggled to get clients excited about his portfolio. “My work showed technical prowess,” but that wasn’t quite enough to get the kind of national advertising and editorial work he was looking for. “Clients need to know that you can perform technically but they want to know you have passion.” </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Everything changed after Leroy took a summer off to photograph bikers in a portable studio at motorcycle rallies at Sturgis, South Dakota, and other places out west. The resulting portraits “capture that moment just after we meet” and highlight the veneer of biker identity, with all its patches, leather, tattoos and weekend renegade posturing. After shooting 1,143 subjects, Leroy self-published <a href="http://www.michelleroyphoto.com/index.php#mi=2&pt=1&pi=10000&s=0&p=2&a=0&at=0">Rally Bikers</a>, a book featuring 63 of the portraits, and began showing it along with his portfolio to art buyers, art directors and photo editors. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The phone started ringing, he says. Over the past year, he’s shot covers for <a href="http://www.michelleroy.net/the-american-lawyer-women-litigators-cover/">The American Lawyer</a> and <a href="http://www.michelleroy.net/corporate-counsel-best-legal-departments-2014/">Corporate Counsel</a> magazines, key art for multiple <a href="http://www.michelleroy.net/megan-re-of-food-network-by-michel-leroy/">Food Network</a> shows, and a <a href="http://www.michelleroyphoto.com/index.php#mi=2&pt=1&pi=10000&s=5&p=1&a=0&at=0">Lenovo campaign</a> that ran at the end of last summer. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“[Leroy] showed his commercial portfolio but I fell in love with his biker work, which I felt had a lot of attitude and soul,” says Digitas VP and Director of Art Production Lisa Oropallo, who met Leroy at the <a href="http://nycfotoworks.com/">NYC Fotoworks</a> portfolio reviews in 2012 and invited him soon afterwards to bid on the Lenovo campaign. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Leroy says he decided to take a summer off to shoot the rally bikers project because the client work he was getting at the time wasn’t giving him much creative satisfaction. He also wanted more work in general. Having observed photographers he’d assisted, “I saw their success from personal work,” Leroy says. So he started looking around for “something to sink my teeth into.” </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He had grown up in Montana, where bikers flock in the summer because of reliably good weather. Of the biker rallies, he says, “Visually they’re like candy, like going to a country fair.” </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So he went back to Montana and spent a summer driving around to various rallies in a borrowed truck. The bikers self-segregate by types of motorcycles they ride, as well as by age, race and class. “They all go to different kinds of rallies,” Leroy says, and he wanted portraits of all types. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He decided not to photograph bikers against a white backdrop, a la Richard Avedon: “Too clich&eacute;,” he says. Instead he photographed his subjects inside a white 10 x 10-foot pop-up tent of the type photographers often use on location for craft service and gear storage. “It’s like you’re inside a softbox. With the sun at the back of the tent, it’s exquisite, luminescent light inside,” Leroy says. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In addition to the sunlight diffusing through the tent walls, Leroy used “just a bare bulb” strobe light powered by a Profoto Pro 7b power pack. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“The sun gave me f/8, and a half stop under that I put [in] the fill light,” he says, explaining that the hard light of the flash made the bikers’ leather, buckles and tattoos pop out. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He shot fast, moving subjects in and out of the tent within a few minutes. Not only do bikers lack patience, he says, but he was trying to capture whatever persona they presented naturally to a stranger before the self-consciousness of being in front of a camera had time to set in. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>At first, he says, bikers and rally organizers were skeptical about his project. But once they started seeing the pictures, Leroy had no trouble finding willing subjects. Many posed for individual portraits, but couples and a few groups posed as well. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Leroy self-published his book using <a href="http://www.magcloud.com/browse/issue/108801">MagCloud</a> (which recently merged with Blurb). His first print run was 30 copies, at $17 each. He’s since ordered two additional print runs, he says. He’s been showing them along with his portfolio, and the response has been positive. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Oropallo asked him to bid for a print and web video campaign for Lenovo computer tablets. Agency art directors wanted visual consistency across the entire campaign, and they wanted Leroy’s Rally Bikers style. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“It was [a case of being in] the right place, at the right time, with the right work,” Leroy says. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The brief called for a campaign that appealed to millennials by looking as if the pictures had been shot casually for Instagram. Leroy says the biggest challenge was to replicate the lighting of the rally bikers project in the ads, which also had to look like the models were lit by their tablet screens. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He prefers to keep his lighting setups “really simple and really large,” so the lighting is consistent over a larger area, allowing for more spontaneity and movement by his models while he’s shooting. “I don’t want to waste time and energy [with the lights] while I’m shooting,” he says. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For the Lenovo campaign, he had to use harder lighting than sunlight diffused through a pop-up tent, because the Lenovo models wore softer clothing than the bikers, without all the buckles and leather. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To replicate the Rally Bikers lighting for the video shoots, he shot in a studio with a cyc wall and four 18K HMI Fresnel lights—“an enormous amount of power,” he says. He also used a trick he learned from photographer and lighting director Jonathan Orenstein: Instead of using the cyc wall as a seamless background for the shoot, he used it as a giant reflector. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“The wall is the light source—and it’s big and powerful. It gives the images clarity and sparkle,” Leroy says. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To get the same lighting effects for the still photographs, he needed even more light than the HMI lights provided in order to eliminate motion blur. So he used strobes with Profoto Pro-8a power packs, which provided both the high power and short duration he needed to freeze the action. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The agency street-cast the talent for a “real people” look, and Leroy used the same approach he used with the bikers, bringing the talent on set and shooting quickly. “I didn’t bore them with long explanations. I gave little information—just simple instructions like, ‘Pretend you’re sitting with the tablet talking to one of your friends,’” he says. “I know I have them for five minutes before they get stale, so I’m going to be done in four minutes.” </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Lenovo campaign ran worldwide in late summer and early fall 2013. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Several other clients have also hired Leroy on the strength of the rally bikers project. The look and feel of the biker portraits doesn’t translate directly to every job. For example, it isn’t appropriate to photograph lawyers the same way he photographed the bikers, he says. But Leroy is happy to have found a gratifying personal project that has opened up commercial opportunities.</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>Photographer Allen Clark makes his living shooting sailing regattas along the East Coast and in the Caribbean, and selling prints afterwards to the competitors through his website, <a href="http://www.photo-boat.com/">PhotoBoat.com</a>. He launched the company in 2005 with his wife, Daniela Clark, who works with him part-time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>PDN: What inspired you to start your business? </strong></div>
<div><strong>Allen Clark:</strong> We were passionate sailors [and] we didn’t want to be pinned down by another business owner or a corporate job while in our twenties. So we quit our jobs (Daniela managed a large sailing school and I was selling boats) and started PhotoBoat. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>PDN: What convinced you there was a market for it?</strong> </div>
<div><strong>Daniela Clark:</strong> We worked as sailing instructors and saw <a href="http://www.yachtshotsbvi.com/">Yacht Shots BVI</a> doing this in the Caribbean, and we saw a market for it in Long Island Sound. It’s a great place to sail, and there are a lot of nice yachts here because of the proximity to New York City and the financial industry. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>PDN: Was it a long learning curve? </strong></div>
<div><strong>DC:</strong> Our first regatta was a big success for us. It was a youth national championship regatta in Westport. [Another photographer] cancelled at the last minute. We had connections and got the job. Since then, we’ve honed our skills more from a marketing perspective. Our photography has improved as well. Allen worked with Yacht Shots BVI for about three months after we opened our business. It was a good experience, going out there every day to shoot and having [Yacht Shots BVI founder] Guy Clothier as a mentor. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>PDN: What distinguishes your style and approach to sailing photography?</strong> </div>
<div><strong>AC:</strong> Our niche has been close-up action photography, where you can see the spray of the water and the expression on the sailors’ faces. And we do a good job of covering everybody, not just people in the front. That works well when we’re selling to individuals. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>PDN: Do you get close to the action with lenses, or with the boat? </strong></div>
<div><strong>AC:</strong> Mostly with the boat. Yacht Shots had an awesome way to photograph regattas: a large rigid inflatable dinghy with a powerful engine, extended tiller and a harness for the photographer. We would get into the racecourse, get the shot, and get out of the way quickly. [At PhotoBoat] we own a 19-foot rigid inflatable boat. [It] is lightweight, fast and maneuverable, which is extremely important for our edge on our competition. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>PDN: What gear do you use? </strong></div>
<div><strong>AC:</strong> Our camera equipment includes a few Nikon D300s, a D700, and a D800; a 600mm lens, a 200-400mm lens, a 70-200mm, a 17-55mm and a 14mm fisheye with an Ikelite underwater housing for some fun shots from the waterline. The 70-200mm is our workhorse lens. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>PDN: Are the spray and saltwater air hard on the gear?</strong> </div>
<div><strong>AC:</strong> You’d think so, but we keep them covered with AquaTech SS Sport Shield Rain Covers, and the camera bodies are pretty weatherproof. Also, when a wave is coming up, you tuck the camera into your body. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>PDN: Do you have a lot of competition? </strong></div>
<div><strong>AC:</strong> There are a few successful companies, and a lot that come and go. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>PDN: Why are some more successful? </strong></div>
<div><strong>AC:</strong> It’s kind of a popular hobby profession. A guy into photography has a boat and wants to give it a try. It can be fun for a while, but it’s a job. You have to work really hard. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>PDN: Where does the hard work come in? </strong></div>
<div><strong>DC:</strong> A lot of it is on the back end, with the processing. We sort the photos and put them online by boat name. That’s a lot of work. That’s not the magic solution, but it’s that kind of thing: treating it like a fulltime job. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>PDN: How do you market yourselves? </strong></div>
<div><strong>AC: </strong>We set up a tent with monitors [at regattas], so people can see the pictures as soon as they get off the water. [Talking] to the sailors [in person], rather than being just an internet business, is really important. We have a lot of repeat customers who anticipate us to be at certain places. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>DC: </strong>We also collect e-mail addresses so we can get in touch with them. We put up a gallery [for each boat] and send them a link. We’ve done minor advertising here and there in local sailing magazines, and there’s a popular sailing website we’ll advertise on now and again. But we can’t market too much to people whose photos we haven’t taken. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>PDN: What are the biggest challenges you have? </strong></div>
<div><strong>DC:</strong> Things we can’t control, like weather. Not enough wind is the thing we probably complain about the most. The more you get out there, the better chance you’re going to get those 25-knot-wind epic days, when racers come off the water with their adrenaline up and they’ve had a great time. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>PDN: Isn’t the work seasonal? </strong></div>
<div><strong>DC:</strong> November and December are the only down times for sailboat racing because of the holidays, but come the end of October we’re [fulfilling] a lot of [orders for] Christmas, so it’s nice that we don’t have to be out on the water as much. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>PDN:</strong> How many regattas are you shooting each year? </div>
<div><strong>AC:</strong> At the most, we’ve done 50. We’ve started to pick and choose, and go to ones that generate more income for us. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>PDN: What distinguishes the events that generate more income? </strong></div>
<div><strong>DC:</strong> There are a lot of factors: the number of boats, the types of boats— some are bigger and have more people on them—and whether people travel from far away. That makes it more special to them, so they’re more likely to want photos to remember. Whether it’s a national championship, as opposed to a weekend race at the yacht club—the championship will be better for us. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>PDN: What’s your advice to other photographers trying to get into this niche? </strong></div>
<div><strong>AC:</strong> Anybody who has the determination to do it should do it. But it’s not just a fun hobby. You have to do the work. Even after long day on water, you have to spend a long night on the computer. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>PDN: After the novelty and fun wears off, what keeps you going? </strong></div>
<div><strong>DC:</strong> We have a lot of pride in this brand we’ve built. People know it, and our photos are on the walls of thousands of people’s houses. That’s satisfying, knowing we’re supplying a product that’s going to last and [inspire] conversation and memories. </div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <em>The following post is brought to you by <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/tour/photographers/?channel=display&amp;subchannel=photogroup&amp;source=us&amp;campaign=campaign1_article1_brand&amp;subcampaign=photo_video">Squarespace</a>, the leading website-publishing platform built with professional and amateur photographers in mind.</em>
        <p>As a photographer, your website is your most valuable asset to promote yourself; it is the fastest way for a potential client to a sense of your style, your experience and your brand. As Maren Levinson<strong>*</strong>, founder of Redeye Reps, puts it: “It’s the single most visible sales tool these days.”</p>
        <p>Levinson is an acclaimed authority within the photography community (PDN photo editor Amy Wolff notes, “Everyone wants her to edit their work.”) and her advice for how to utilize your website as both a tool in itself, and the starting point for your overall branding, can be broken down into four things to consider.<br />
        <br />
        <img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/Image2_sqsp-pdn.jpg" /></p>
        <p><strong>1. The First Impression</strong></p>
        <p>Levinson says she learns a lot about a photographer’s style and attention to detail based on how he or she presents his or herself online. “The design or template selection should match the esthetic of the photographer or their work,” she explains. “It should be a framework that mimics, complements, supports or plays off the work itself. So, it can be loud and colorful, quiet and elegant or bold and simple, but whatever a photographer chooses, they should choose it thoughtfully and with purpose.”</p>
        <p><strong>Squarespace Shortcut:</strong> The Style Editor gives you the creative control to personalize each carefully considered <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/templates/?channel=display&amp;subchannel=photogroup&amp;source=us&amp;campaign=campaign1_article1_templates&amp;subcampaign=photo_video">template</a> through fonts, colors, layouts and custom CSS to achieve a custom design that’s all your own, all without writing a line of code.<br />
        <br />
        <img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/Image3_sqsp-pdn.jpg" /></p>
        <p><strong>2. Your Website’s Functionality</strong></p>
        <p>A good website loads quickly, with clean organization and navigation, and no guesswork involved as to where your contact information is located. Beyond the basics, photographers need to continually update their site design and functionality to stay ahead of the curve. Levinson urges photographers to stand out from the crowd by being amongst the first to adopt new technology and platforms into their online presence. She points out that professional photographers who utilized Instagram early on are “very happy right about now.” All social media pages should be integrated with your website.</p>
        <p><strong>Squarespace Shortcut:</strong> In addition to using the latest HTML, CSS and Javascript techniques, the site’s reliable cloud infrastructure ensures there is never anything to install, patch or upgrade. Squarespace also offers diverse and powerful social integrations, from Twitter and Instagram to Flickr and Smugmug, that let you connect with your audience everywhere. Each design has also been carefully considered and crafted to make your photos look spectacular on any device.<br />
        <br />
        <img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/Image4_sqsp-pdn.jpg" /></p>
        <p><strong>3. Your Photo Edit &amp; Gallery Organization</strong></p>
        <p>Take a critical eye to your work. Levinson says she asks photographers to consider the same question on every image: “Is this a photograph that only I could make?” She says, “Don’t include [a photo] because you think it’s what people want to see. Include the pictures you are most passionate about; the pictures where someone would say ‘that is such a you picture.’”<br />
        <br />
        <img alt="" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/Image5_sqsp-pdn.jpg" /></p>
        <p>When organizing your galleries, lead with the group that is the most robust or will have the most impact. She notes that viewers will form an impression of your work from the first gallery, so choose something that represents you and the direction you want to go in. Within each gallery, choose your order carefully. “The first image is the defining image and carries the responsibility of saying what the rest of gallery will be like.” She suggests, “ Start on an upbeat, get into the thoughtfulness and beauty of the series, then end with a contemplative or uplifting punch. There’s a lyricism to it, in the best-case scenarios.”</p>
        <p><strong>Squarespace shortcut:</strong> Utilize Squarespace’s multiple options for presentation, including full-screen, slideshow and lightbox layout with easy drag-and-drop management, display effects and the ability to mix still, video and audio content within the same gallery. All features can be found <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/tour/photographers/?channel=display&amp;subchannel=photogroup&amp;source=us&amp;campaign=campaign1_article1_gallery&amp;subcampaign=photo_video">here</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Align your brand through consistent, thoughtful and personal promotions.</strong></p>
        <p>Whoever is viewing your site, your potential clients are “highly visually literate,” says Levinson. They have experience in communications design, creative direction, or photo editing and buying. She emphasizes that these potential clients are looking for someone who can execute their vision, so consistency is the fastest way to gain the trust of creatives. For example, inconsistency in your logo from website to mobile, to book to promo cards, can imply a larger sloppiness towards business practices or quality of imagery. She advises, “Use your branding and presentation to show who you are, not only visually, but as an artist, businessperson and collaborator.”</p>
        <p>In her experience, the best promotions are personal: postcards with a strong image, a quarterly newsletter sent out to a list of people you have met (and would have an interest in what you’ve been working on), and custom letters, booklets and print promotional pieces. Avoid impersonal emails, and make sure printed pieces are flawlessly printed. Overall, Levinson says, “Show what makes you exceptional.”</p>
        <p><strong>Squarespace shortcut:</strong> Create your logo using Squarespace’s <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/logo/?channel=display&amp;subchannel=photogroup&amp;source=us&amp;campaign=campaign1_article1_logo&amp;subcampaign=photo_video">custom logo designer</a> and keep continuity across all your marketing. All aspects of your website design will seamlessly transition to any device display.<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div><em>For some photographers, the only way to execute an idea without compromise is to publish it on their own. Whether creating print or digital publications, calling them quarterlies or magazines or even “manuals,” photographers-turned-publishers have pursued projects that they felt nobody else could make, building communities and brands around publications that have led to related work and no small amount of personal and creative satisfaction. As Daniel Wakefield Pasley, one of the founders of cycling journal Manual For Speed, points out, “No one is going to pay you or give you the space to do it right, so if you have this aim to do it right, then you basically have to be a publisher.” </em></div>
        <div><em><br />
        </em></div>
        <div><em>PDN recently spoke with the founders of three publications with different goals, subjects, audiences and business models—to find out why and how they became publishers and what they’ve learned about developing engaging content, reaching readers and collaborating with sponsors and advertisers. Below is the third part of this three-part series, which originally appeared in the August issue of PDN. Use these links to read <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/Photographers-Become-11370.shtml">part one</a>, about the cycling journal Manual For Speed, and <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/When-Photographers-B-11390.shtml">part two</a>, about travel and lifestyle journal Tiny Atlas Quarterly.</em></div>
        <div><em><br />
        </em></div>
        <div>
        <div><a href="http://romkehoogwaerts.com/">Romke Hoogwaerts</a> founded <a href="http://mosslessmagazine.com/">Mossless</a> magazine in 2009 as way to stay connected to the international photography community while he was living abroad in Vietnam. Using Tumblr as his publishing platform, Hoogwaerts, who had recently graduated from high school, posted personal work by mostly young photographers accompanied by short interviews. “I wanted to help share a lot of the photographs that I was seeing but add a little context,” he says. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>He did this every couple of days, slowly growing his audience through platforms like Tumblr and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/mossless/">Flickr</a> as he delved into the interconnected photography communities that exist online. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>After more than a year publishing photographs and interviews by photographers who interested him, Hoogwaerts felt he’d built enough relationships and gained enough of a reputation for thoughtful interviews and photo editing that he was able to launch, in print, what he calls an “abstract magazine” whose format varies according to the theme and content of each issue. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“It was important to me that I build a network first and find the right people” with whom to work, he says, since those would be his first readers and the people who might champion the publication. He launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the first issue, which featured four books in a box set, each with work by a different photographer. He offered backers who contributed $35 or more to the campaign a copy of the publication, and watched nervously to see if he’d receive the support he needed. Almost all of the funds to meet his modest goal of $4,000 came in the last week, thanks in part to a shout-out on the blog <a href="http://www.aphotoeditor.com/2010/12/17/kickstarter-and-mossless-magazine/">A Photo Editor</a>. In the end, Hoogwaerts raised $4,776. He offset-printed it in an edition of 500 and packaged it in screen-printed boxes he made himself. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>He and his partner in business and in life, Grace Leigh, worked together on the second issue, which they inkjet-printed and assembled in an edition of 100. Their independence allows them to “change [the publishing format] up every single time,” Hoogwaerts explains, “so each time we found something that hadn’t been identified or published yet, or an idea that we had that we hadn’t seen yet, we tried to find a format for it.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>To learn about publishing and printing, Hoogwaerts took classes on editing and curating while a student at New York City’s School of Visual Arts. He read manuals and information on the web about printing styles and binding, and watched YouTube tutorials. “There’s a lot of information out there that really makes it possible for people to learn [about publishing],” he notes. He learned about art law by taking a class at <a href="http://www.vlany.org/">Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts</a>. “The rest is trial and error,” he adds. “I made a lot of mistakes along the way, and I cherish them.” For instance, inkjet printing turned out to be unrealistic for mass production—it’s time-consuming and printer ink is expensive. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The third issue of Mossless, by far the most ambitious in terms of scope, print-run and expense, was recently <a href="http://store.mosslessmagazine.com/product/issue-3-the-united-states-2003-2013">released</a>. “Issue Three: The United States (2003-2013),” a decade-long look at American culture and socioeconomics, features more than 500 images by 100 photographers, and “happens to feel much more like a book than anything else we’ve done,” Hoogwaerts says. They set a Kickstarter goal of $25,000 and raised more than $33,000, printing 2,500 copies at a printer in Minneapolis. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>At press time, more than half of the books were spoken for by Kickstarter backers, people who placed pre-orders and the Mossless distributor, which represents the publication in the United Kingdom and Europe (Hoogwaerts and Leigh are handling domestic distribution themselves). </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>To create “Issue Three,” Hoogwaerts and Leigh bookmarked photos for months on end. When they felt they had enough photographs to make the publication they envisioned, they began requesting images from photographers. (Photographers have been enthusiastic about contributing, Hoogwaerts says, not only to this issue, but throughout his time working on Mossless.) They hung the images on a wall and began editing them into a continuous sequence. Not only did they want to provide a current look at America through the personal images of the photographers, they also wanted to emphasize that “this journey is one that you can take essentially for free”: all of the photographs had already been published online on blogs or websites. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“Many of these photographers are very aware of other works in the book, and are always responding to one another, whether or not they are aware of it,” Hoogwaerts says. “Issue Three” plucks these photographs from the stream of online image publishing and places them in context with one another. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The dream for the future of Mossless, Hoogwaerts says, is to acquire printing equipment “so we can print whenever we want … more efficiently [and] with a faster turnover, but also understand how the printing will work so that we can design and plan everything ahead of time with a much more acute understanding of how it will look.” They’re working on a new Mossless logo that features a visual reference to the Japanese concept of kaizen, which means “continuous improvement.” Hoogwaerts says, “That’s something we really believe in.” </div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>The three-minute <a href="http://www.angelaandithyle.com/FILMS/2/">video</a> for Benefit Cosmetics, directed by the duo <a href="http://www.angelaandithyle.com/">Angela &amp; Ithyle</a>, has the look and spirit of an old-fashioned musical. Through swooping tracking shots, wide shots and close-ups, it shows a chorus of young women in poodle skirts and polka dot aprons dancing around a stylized pink and white beauty shop and a dance studio as they sing about the secrets of making eyebrows look beautiful. After the lead dancer—whose role is a combination fairy godmother and beauty consultant—shows a novice how to shape her eyebrows to flatter her face, the video ends with an exuberant dance number, during which confetti rains down on the dancers. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Capturing the choreography as well as the how-to instructions required three cameras, a jib and a dolly, as well as detailed storyboarding and planning. “It was so kinetic and movement-oriented,” says Angela Kohler, a photographer who, with her partner Ithyle Griffiths, has been shooting motion for about six years. There was a lot for both directors to keep their eyes on during the 12-hour shoot. “You’re looking for a physical performance and an emotional performance,” Griffiths explains. While the choreographer, Megan Lawson, and the team’s director of photography, Patrick Jones, were on set to look for any missteps or lip-syncing lapses, the directors started the shoot by asking the dancers to help, too. “We said, ‘If you didn’t get it, tell us. We’ll reshoot things. We can’t watch everything.’” </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Benefit film gave the directing duo a quick lesson in shooting choreography, and also represented a big step in the evolution of their directing work. Having shot stills for advertising clients like HAVAS, McCann and Ogilvy &amp; Mather, they made their first big splash as directors shooting a stop-motion video for Amazon’s Kindle that debuted in 2010. The jaunty commercial, a quick-cut series of stills showing a model reading a Kindle and being launched into an imaginative flight of fancy, garnered Angela &amp; Ithyle a lot of attention. More stop-motion assignments followed. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“Stop motion is a lot of fun, but it’s kind of a one-trick pony. We wanted to get more into live action,” says Kohler. For example, the duo, who are represented by the production company <a href="http://www.grandlarge.tv/">Grand Large, Inc.</a>, recently shot a commercial for Target that combined some live action and some stop motion to show how paint color can transform a room. The assignment for Benefit’s brow division fulfills their goal to direct motion pieces “that are magical, but not necessarily animation-based,” says Kohler. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There was a learning curve, however. Stop motion offers “the ultimate control,” says Griffiths, while the Benefit commercial, with its large cast, presented many variables. As experienced still photographers, they are used to creating several variations of every shot. In live action, however, “continuity is huge,” says Kohler. “People are moving all over the place, and you have to make sure a ponytail hasn’t shifted from this shoulder to that shoulder.” </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Jared Bailey, international spokesperson at <a href="http://www.benefitcosmetics.com/">Benefit Cosmetics</a>, gave the team the assignment and also wrote the lyrics for the song sung in the video. The budget for the shoot was tight, so Kohler and Griffiths decided to produce the shoot themselves and put money toward costumes and rehearsal time. “We had to be judicious about where we put the money to get the most impact visually,” says Kohler, who adds that everyone on the crew performed extra tasks. “Coming from still photography, we’re used to working with intimate crews where we know everyone’s name, but there were times when we’d say, ‘If only we had two more people.’” </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On the advice of a friend, they contacted choreographer Lawson, who has co-choreographed shows for Madonna, and played her the video’s song. In addition to choreographing the video, she recommended a dance studio to use for casting calls and rehearsals, which was far less expensive than a photo studio, and helped cast the video. The directors had planned to hire models who can also dance, “and Megan said, ‘Oh no you don’t,’” Griffiths says. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>By the end of the rehearsals, the scenes were blocked and the dancing was “pretty polished by the time we got to the set,” says Kohler. As they have done with stop-motion work, they made detailed storyboards for the Benefit video. These, as well as production designer Sara Kugelmass’s renderings of her set designs, were approved by the client before shooting began. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Kohler and Griffiths chose to shoot the video at <a href="http://sourcefilmstudio.com/">Source Film Studio</a> in Hollywood, a green-screen studio that had HMI lights mounted overhead. The overhead lights—roughly 40 1K HMIs in large softboxes that could be controlled and positioned using an iPad—made changing lights easy and avoided the need for light stands that could have interfered with the movement of their cameras. Kugelmass painted the walls pink and white and brought in cosmetics counters, mirrors, and other props to transform the studio. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>During filming, they shot with three Canon EOS 5D Mark IIIs: one set on a jib, one on a dolly, and one handheld. The jib allowed them to hoist the camera for high angles on the dancers, while the dolly provided lateral movement with slightly more control. “It’s easier to focus with the dolly, because the jib is going up and down and left to right, so the focus puller had his work cut out for him with the jib,” Griffiths says. “The dolly is a little more precise. The jib is a chainsaw; the dolly is a knife.” The dolly also helped them get low angles when, for example, “you want to make the dancers look tall,” Kohler says. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In filming the dance sequences, their impulse was to shoot wide to show all the movement. But to get close-ups of someone singing or zoom in on eyebrows, they relied primarily on the handheld camera. “It’s nice to have that cut-away” during the editing process, says Griffiths. “If you only have two cameras, it gets tiresome.” </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Client Bailey was on the set throughout the shoot and was able to check, but Griffiths notes that they kept shooting at a fast clip to get everything done within the 12-hour day. Once the shoot wrapped, the post-production was handled in New York, with Griffiths and Kohler checking revisions remotely as they were made. During post, foreign-language translations of all the signs on the set and held by models were swapped into the video, and color was corrected. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The video has been used online and in retail stores. A “directors’ cut” version as well as a behind-the-scenes video, both edited by Wade Davis, are on the Angela &amp; Ithyle website. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The photographer/directors are delighted both with the results and with what they learned from the experience. “We are in love with shooting dancers. They are so positive and really playful,” says Kohler. “Now we want to collaborate with dancers all the time.” </div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div><em>For some photographers, the only way to execute an idea without compromise is to publish it on their own. Whether creating print or digital publications, calling them quarterlies or magazines or even “manuals,” photographers-turned-publishers have pursued projects that they felt nobody else could make, building communities and brands around publications that have led to related work and no small amount of personal and creative satisfaction. As <a href="http://www.danielwakefieldpasley.net/">Daniel Wakefield Pasley</a>, one of the founders of cycling journal <a href="http://www.manualforspeed.com/">Manual For Speed</a>, points out, “No one is going to pay you or give you the space to do it right, so if you have this aim to do it right, then you basically have to be a publisher.” </em></div>
        <div><em><br />
        </em></div>
        <div>PDN<em> recently spoke with the founders of three publications with different goals, subjects, audiences and business models—to find out why and how they became publishers and what they’ve learned about developing engaging content, reaching readers and collaborating with sponsors and advertisers. Below is the second part of this three-part series, which originally appeared in the August issue of </em>PDN<em>. Read part one, about the cycling journal Manual For Speed, <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/features/Photographers-Become-11370.shtml">here</a>.</em></div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>
        <div>When commercial photographer <a href="http://www.emilynathan.com/">Emily Nathan</a> launched <a href="http://tinyatlasquarterly.com/"><em>Tiny Atlas Quarterly (TAQ)</em></a>, the travel and lifestyle journal, in 2012, she envisioned it as a vehicle for personal images—and not just her own. “I knew I couldn’t sustain the momentum of a travel magazine on my own,” she says. “A magazine is an interesting thing because it has a lot of people working on it.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>So she enlisted her friend and former client Liz Mullaly, a principal in the creative agency <a href="http://lionsandtigersco.com/">Lions and Tigers</a> who had previously worked as in-house art director for Apple. Like Nathan, Mullaly loved the idea of a creative outlet outside of client work. Nathan’s husband, Jacob Huffman, an interface designer, built the site’s architecture and web pages. Nathan also reached out to photographers she knew who were shooting for themselves, sometimes in connection with assignment work on location, and asked them for story ideas or images they wanted to share. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Among the first to contribute were <a href="http://magdalenawosinska.com/">Magdalena Wosinska</a>, <a href="http://www.jensiska.com/">Jen Siska</a>, <a href="http://jaimebeechum.com/">Jaime Beechum</a>, <a href="http://www.jameschiang.com/">James Chiang</a> and <a href="http://www.terriloewenthal.com/">Terri Loewenthal</a>. Like Nathan, they had a mix of editorial and commercial clients, but were regularly creating new personal work. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“Great photographers shoot a lot on their own,” Mullaly notes. “This is an opportunity for photographers to post work they love or a great trip they photographed.” On <em>TAQ</em>, their work is presented as a feature story or as a slide show in the Place or Portraits sections, often with text about the subjects or the photographers’ experiences. After the first issue, more photographers contacted Nathan, asking how they could get involved. “The magazine is a way to elevate personal work” with the help of editing and art direction, says Nathan. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Not every photographer who approaches <em>TAQ</em> fits its tone and point of view. Nathan often works with them to refine their story ideas, which might revolve around a past project or plans for an upcoming trip. She doesn’t make traditional assignments with shot lists of places or subjects to photograph, she says, but gives photographers a “project brief about what makes a successful <em>TAQ</em> story.” She wants <em>TAQ</em> stories to have a strong point of view and feel “immersive.” As Mullaly puts it, “We don’t run a lot of descriptive photos of a place, but you get the sense of what it’s like to stand in the light of a place in the evening.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The editorial mission of <em>TAQ</em>, Nathan says, is in part inspired by changes in the way photographers work and promote themselves. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“It’s not enough to just be a great photographer anymore. You need to have a greater creative mission,” she says. A photographer’s personal projects are no longer relegated to the portfolios they show at the end of a meeting, after their client has seen what they’ve done on assignment, she notes: “Personal work and projects are king.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Her decision to take on the role of magazine publisher and creative director, she says, may represent the natural evolution of the roles she plays as a photographer. “Part of the job of a photographer now is to be a creative director,” she says. In shooting for advertising clients, “You have to do a treatment every time. You have to be able to describe your process and production. The magazine is partly a response to that.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>To date, <em>TAQ</em> has been a labor of love for everyone involved. But that may change. Last year, <em>TAQ</em> launched a successful Kickstarter campaign to raise $20,000, and the money contributed to the production of a printed annual featuring all of the work posted on the site in 2013; backers who pledged to the campaign received a copy. “We didn’t want to introduce a paywall to the website,” Nathan explains. “People would prefer to support a magazine than a website.” In June, clothing and housewares retailer Anthropologie agreed to sell the annual in its stores. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Nathan and her team were able to sell a small number of print ads in the annual. And, attracted by <em>TAQ</em>’s small but engaged network of creative, well-traveled readers and contributors, several brands have talked to the <em>TAQ</em> team about collaborating on marketing plans. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>What form that marketing might take is still under discussion. “We’ve had some interest in placing ads on the website. We want to be careful how we do that. We don’t want to, quote unquote, sell out,” Mullaly says. Another possibility is that <em>TAQ</em> could act as a creative agency, gathering its collaborators to design and shoot sponsored content or printed advertorials for a client. Says Mullaly, “We are a team of people with a certain point of view on travel experience. We can whip up travel ideas on where to go, what to do, and then [produce] great creative to go with that.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“The team that works on this magazine is amazing, all people at the top of their game.” Nathan says <em>TAQ</em>’s contributors have proven their ability to serve a brand’s needs. “The photographers who shoot our features are all advertising shooters who are used to working on big productions and can manage big projects.” They also know how to conceive and produce appealing content: Their work for <em>TAQ</em> proves it.</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div><em>For some photographers, the only way to execute an idea without compromise is to publish it on their own. Whether creating print or digital publications, calling them quarterlies or magazines or even “manuals,” photographers-turned-publishers have pursued projects that they felt nobody else could make, building communities and brands around publications that have led to related work and no small amount of personal and creative satisfaction. As Daniel Wakefield Pasley, one of the founders of cycling journal Manual For Speed, points out, “No one is going to pay you or give you the space to do it right, so if you have this aim to do it right, then you basically have to be a publisher.” </em></div>
<div><em><br />
</em></div>
<div><em>PDN recently spoke with the founders of three publications with different goals, subjects, audiences and business models—to find out why and how they became publishers and what they’ve learned about developing engaging content, reaching readers and collaborating with sponsors and advertisers. Below is the first part of this three-part series, which originally appeared in the August issue of PDN.</em></div>
<div><em><br />
</em></div>
<div>
<div><a href="http://www.danielwakefieldpasley.net/">Daniel Wakefield Pasley</a> and <a href="http://emilianogranado.com/">Emiliano Granado</a> were in Italy, attempting to cover the month-long Giro D’Italia cycling race, when something clicked. The pair were more than two years into publishing <a href="http://www.manualforspeed.com/">Manual For Speed</a> (MFS), their web-based journal chronicling professional cycling from an insider’s perspective. They’d experienced modest success in traffic and had a sponsor in Castelli, a cycling apparel company, when the cycling team with which they’d been embedded disbanded for lack of funds. Wakefield Pasley and Granado were essentially on their own, trying to create a behind-the-scenes story without access to a cycling team. “We didn’t have a move,” Granado recalls. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Their “last-ditch effort,” Wakefield Pasley says, was to go to the biggest event they could, the Giro, and tell readers “exactly what it’s like to be at a race.” Wakefield Pasley, who writes their reports in addition to photographing races, rated the espressos they drank and the hotels they stayed in. He wrote about the music that played in their rental car and their run-ins with various race officials and law enforcement. He wrote about the crowds and the culture surrounding the race. The writing and photographs are compelling and odd and funny. Since the Giro, people have come to know MFS as “gonzo journalism for cycling.” “We weren’t consciously like, ‘We’re just going to go gonzo on this,’ but I guess that’s what we did,” Granado says. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>During the Giro, they also grabbed attention by publishing stories every single night. Previously when they’d covered a race, it would be weeks before they published their reports. Daily publishing added a timeliness to their coverage that allowed people to follow the race via MFS rather than, or in addition to, the mainstream press. Their site traffic spiked, and their sponsor, Castelli, took note. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><a href="http://castelli-cycling.com/en/home/">Castelli</a> is an Italian company. The sponsorship of MFS is an initiative of their U.S. distributor. But suddenly “the people at Castelli in Italy wanted to talk to us, and they wanted to figure out: Is MFS a global Castelli project or is it a U.S. Castelli project?” Wakefield Pasley says. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“There was a clear-cut before Christ/after death moment, and it was the Giro D’Italia,” Granado adds. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Since then, the attention has grown steadily. Granado and Wakefield Pasley had courted the Garmin cycling team, also sponsored by Castelli, for a couple of years, but were kept at arm’s length at least partly because of their irreverent style. This past spring, however, when MFS was covering the Pais Vasco race in the Basque region of Spain, one of Garmin’s top riders tweeted that MFS is some of the best cycling journalism he’s read in a long time. Now, their relationship with the Garmin team has solidified and they have insider access to a major team. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Granado and Wakefield Pasley began MFS because they saw a gap in how cycling is covered. The mainstream press celebrates the few guys who win races, but have no time for the hundreds of other cyclists who are “elite-level athletes and they’re just hanging on” to the sport, Wakefield Pasley says. “Cycling in Europe is glitzy and glammy, and big tour buses and podium girls and Lamborghinis and Italians.” Except for the elite ten athletes, cycling in the United States is a blue-collar sport. “These guys are kind of like rodeo athletes in Spandex, but the rest of the world views cycling as more like racecar driving,” Wakefield Pasley says. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Rather than pitching individual stories to the cycling press for one-off fees, Wakefield Pasley and Granado decided to pitch a digital cycling journal to Castelli US, giving the company exclusive sponsorship of the site. It was important to have “the ability to check in repeatedly with the same people and have some sort of narrative that plays out over years,” Granado says. “Also from a career point of view, it just makes so much more sense to own your content versus just selling it off to somebody for $200…. If Manual for Speed died today, we’d still be the Manual for Speed guys. We would still be the guys that can bring it in that way, whatever that way is.” </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It’s not lost on Wakefield Pasley and Granado that, at a time when brands are looking more and more to editorial-style content to promote their products, they’ve shown that they are a creative team capable of executing—and promoting—content for a brand. “We can tell those stories and create those stories and produce those stories,” Granado says in a mock-pitch. “Give us money.” </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To make the site sustainable, they say, they will have to continue to refine its business model. This year they launched a project to document a series of American races and were able to bring Clif Bar on as a sponsor for that work. The pair have also landed commercial work because of MFS. And they earn thousands of dollars selling MFS-branded shirts, jerseys and other cycling swag. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>They’ve taken some of what they have learned and applied it to another web-based publishing project, <a href="http://www.yonderjournal.com/">Yonder Journal</a>, which focuses on outdoor adventure and recreation. In July they embarked on a 25-day trip sponsored by Yakima, the car-rack manufacturer, documenting recreation in the American West. They’re hoping the trip will be their Giro moment for Yonder Journal.</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div>China's modernization is often celebrated by images of progress: gleaming new skyscrapers, bullet trains, and a rising middle class. But since 2006, photographer <a href="http://www.ianteh.com/">Ian Teh</a> has been exploring what he calls the undercurrents of China’s economic and industrial progress, especially the country’s rapid environmental degradation.  </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>On the eve of Earth Day this spring, MSNBC.com published “Yellow River: China’s environmental sorrow,” a version of Teh’s project about the ecological and esthetic demise of the Yellow River. The work is a beautiful lament. Presented as a video slideshow with a voiceover narrative read by Teh, the (mostly) panoramic images evoke not only a sense of loss, but also a willfulness to forget.  </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“It was important to me, for most of the images, that the first impression of these landscapes was one of beauty. This aspect of the experience, I felt, connected the viewer to the reverence the Chinese had accorded to the great river throughout history,” Teh explains in an e-mail interview. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>He adds that he also wanted to create a sense of ambiguity within the images. “This was important because embedded within many of the images were subtle signs of the transactional costs incurred in the realization of China’s dream to modernize … What I hope the viewer will take away is a bittersweet experience, a sense of what could ultimately be an irretrievable loss.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Teh has worked on a number of stories about China with MSNBC.com Director of Photography <a href="http://amypereira.people.msnbc.com/">Amy Pereira</a> over the last decade. She has kept tabs on the development of Teh’s Yellow River project since he started it in 2011, and has been waiting for the right time to publish it. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“It’s a good fit for MSNBC.com because it covers many of the issues we focus on, including socioeconomic disparity and the environment,” Pereira says via e-mail. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“So much great work has come out of China in recent years, but Ian has a unique eye and keen understanding of these issues from years of concentrated focus,” she says, adding, “His photos possess a great deal of humanity, depth and beauty.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Teh began exploring the environmental costs of China’s modernization after moving to Beijing in 2006. With so many journalists doing stories about the manifestations of China’s economic growth, he decided to explore its less visible roots. Energy production struck him as an obvious place to start. China was building an average of two coal power stations per week when he arrived; the rate has since doubled. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“I decided to explore the coal industry,” he explains. The result was <a href="http://www.panos.co.uk/stories/2-13-1147-1653/Ian-Teh/Traces/">“Dark Clouds,”</a> a series of bleak, artful, documentary images of coalburning operations and the people who work in them. As an extension of that project, he did a series called <a href="http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/moving-walls/20/traces-landscapes-transition-yellow-river-basin">“Traces,”</a> featuring panoramics of landscapes altered by coal and other types of industrial production. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Teh explained that the “Traces” project led him to consider how societies tend to take stock of their environments only periodically. They notice incremental change only when “something significant has happened to mark that change—for example a demolition, the beginning of an enormous construction, or the completion of a new building or engineering project,” he says. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>But China has been altering its natural environment at what he terms “a rapacious pace” for three decades. Teh wanted to document those changes with the intent “to engage contemplation” about them. His ongoing Yellow River project is part of that effort. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>He started the project in Lanzhou in 2011, after receiving a <a href="http://emergencyfund.magnumfoundation.org/impact/">Magnum Foundation Emergency Fund</a> grant. He chose Lanzhou because it was the first city built on the river and remains the largest. The area around Lanzhou is “known as China’s cradle of civilization, one that dates back some 5,000 years,” Teh says. “Today, it’s a fast-growing city, a petrochemical hub and one of the most polluted cities in China.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>At the outset he consulted maps and researched both print and online resources to gain an understanding of the river from historical, environmental, economic and political perspectives. “What was important for me was to get an overview on the river and the places I was planning to visit. Once I had decided where I was going, the rest of it was about exploring on the ground and seeing what I discovered.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Teh does a lot of driving and walking in search of images. “The area that I am exploring is vast, while my budget is limited,” he says. “Patience and persistence are friends.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>As part of his “Traces” project, the Yellow River project emphasizes panoramic landscapes. The scale of a panoramic image “is an important part of the viewer experience,” particularly in exhibition settings, he explains. But he also shoots with a 35mm camera for images that provide context and show the region on “a more human scale.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The portraits and images of everyday realities of peoples’ lives “serve as reminders that these sometimes beautiful landscapes are places where people have to live and work, and that there is another narrative that isn’t fully revealed,” he explains, adding, “The people are there [in several images] to humanize the landscape.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>On the surface, the images are spare, simple, and beautiful. But Teh is most interested in finding images that have other layers of significance, even though that significance may not be immediately apparent. One of Teh’s favorite images is a bird’s-eye view of the Yellow River. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“Nothing is in the image other than the sunlit ripples of the river’s water. It suggests something otherworldly and sublime, peaceful,” he says. “I’m afforded that view because of the dam I’m standing on, China’s first dam and an engineering feat of the ‘60s, but its construction was fraught with problems and controversy.” (Teh notes that his extended captions, which offer information outside the context of the frame, are an integral part of each image.) </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Pereira suggested to Teh the idea of publishing the images on MSNBC.com as <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/watch/yellow-river-chinas-environmental-sorrow-233261123594">a narrated video</a>.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“We’ve been experimenting with different approaches to storytelling since we launched in the fall,” she says. “There is such grace to Ian’s photographs and they lend themselves beautifully to the fluidity of film.” </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Although Teh narrates the video, he was reluctant to write the voiceover script. “I wanted the narration to have a more lyrical presence that matched the mood of the images, and so I suggested E. J. Swift,” the science fiction and fantasy writer, he says. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>In addition to publication by MSNBC.com, Teh’s Yellow River project was exhibited at <a href="http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/moving-walls/20/traces-landscapes-transition-yellow-river-basin">Open Society Foundations’ Moving Walls 2013</a>. As he continues to work on the project, he’s looking for other exhibition venues, including in China.</div>

        We asked photographers who have published books within the last three years to share some details of the deals they made with book publishers. Arrangements vary not only from publisher to publisher, but also within book publishing houses, depending upon variables such as the photographer’s reputation, the book design and specifications, the target market, and other factors.
        <p>What follows is a list of book deals, with the book titles, author names and other details removed, both out of respect for requests for anonymity and to reduce each deal to a list of terms that any photographer should consider when negotiating a contract with a publishing house.</p>
        <p>Many of the photographers chose to manage tasks traditionally handled by book publishing houses, including design and publicity. Publishers are also shifting the risk of publishing a book to photographers, asking them to help raise funds to cover production and other costs.</p>
        <p>A photographer who has published 12 books said he felt “lucky” that he had never had to pay his publishers’ production costs. (His publisher has issued many of his books in separate high-priced, limited editions, and revenue from those sales has defrayed the cost of less expensive trade editions.)</p>
        <p>Noting that photographers now see publishing a book as a necessary step before landing a gallery show, he says, “It used to be the opposite.” He fears that publishers extend offers to unknown artists while also telling them, “But you have to front all the expenses… removing the risk for us.”</p>
        <p>We asked photographers who contributed money to cover their publishers’ cost why they chose not to self-publish their books. One said self-publishing demanded too much in time and resources.</p>
        <p>Another photographer told us he felt it was “important to have a well-known publisher put out my first monograph” because he didn’t have a high profile. “I could never reach the same [production] quality if I self-published,” he added. “The savings would not even be that great once you pay for a designer, writers, etc. I prefer to do what I do best—photograph—and let others do what they do best—design and make beautiful books. I also wanted my book available for distribution in several countries, on Amazon and at other retail outlets that a large publisher has better access to.”</p>
        <p>For comments from publishers, see our article “<a href="/The-Costly-Business--11311.shtml">The Costly Business of Photo Book Publishing</a>.” In the cases of those publishers not mentioned in the piece, their responses are listed below.</p>

        <strong>Photographer’s notes:</strong> “Lots of [factors influence whether] a publisher is going to publish the book and if they are going to fund it themselves. I had a second book, a small but consistent following, and a bunch of shows in the pipeline, so there was no need for the publisher to raise money. The book did very well and they got their investment back. The book could easily have failed and they would be out money. It was a risk they took based on where I am in my career.”</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div><strong>Client:</strong> Crate and Barrel</div>
        <div><strong>Art Director:</strong> Debi Kogan</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Commercial assignments for furniture and bedding have to strike a balance between the believable and the aspirational, says New York photographer <a href="http://alechemer.com/">Alec Hemer</a>. “It’s always my goal to make it look real and inviting,” says Hemer, who shoots interiors for magazines such as <em>House Beautiful and Country Living</em> and advertising for West Elm, Macy’s, Home Depot, Armstrong and others.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>On a recent shoot for Crate and Barrel, he had to create a warm, sunlit scene of two young girls in their nightgowns running through a bedroom as if they had just gotten up and were ready to play. Though the set was built in a daylight studio in Chicago, the day of the shoot was dark and gloomy, so he had to recreate the look of morning light using a mix of HMI and strobe lighting.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>Logistics</strong></div>
        <div>The bed and the thrown-back duvet were the stars of the shot. Says Hemer, “We wanted the eye to move from the girl running to the bed and then to the back of the set,” where one little girl was kneeling. Art director Debi Kogan also wanted to be sure there was room in the image to run copy on top of it.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Hemer, Kogan and stylist and set builder Bobbi Lin discussed some ideas for what the girls could be doing in the shot, and decided to have one running toward the back of the set where the other girl would be playing. Hemer, who likes photographing people in his interiors, notes, “This shot was cleanly styled and the models added a lot of life and vitality.” He wanted to capture some of the motion of the little girl running through the room, “but I didn’t want her to be totally blurry.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Working with kids meant he had to shoot quickly, before their attention wandered. “Kids take direction really well, in my experience, but you have to keep it fun.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>When he’s collaborating with a set builder, he says, “I feel it’s important to make a workable set that not only looks great, but also accommodates a good lighting strategy.” However, he always comes to the shoot prepared to improvise.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>Lighting</strong></div>
        <div>In the room set, Hemer needed to light two different areas, he says: the bed, which was closer to the camera, and the area in the back where the little girl was kneeling.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>To light the area where the girl was running, he set up a Profoto ProDaylight 1.2K HMI light on a C-stand, and bounced it into the wall and ceiling to the back and left of the set. He had to flag the light off using two pieces of foam core taped together, so it didn’t illuminate too much of the area at the back of the set, which he had lit separately. Without the flags, he says, the bounced light would have complicated the strobe lights he had planned for that area of the set.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>To add drama and interest in the area where the girl was kneeling and the dresser across from her, Hemer set up two Profoto heads with standard reflectors. These heads, which he attached to the back side of the set, ran off a Profoto Acute 2400 watts/seconds pack. “One of the heads shot away from the set window and bounced into the actual window and wall of the studio,” Hemer says. “The other head was boomed out about a foot from the set and shot straight down through the set windows to emulate daylight and create some bright patches of light on the floor.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Hemer says he often mixes continuous lights and strobes. “For a constant daylight-balanced source, there’s nothing stronger than HMIs.” At the same time, strobes can be easily dialed up or down to change output. In this shot, he chose to use strobes “because I wanted the bits of light on the ground to be brighter and hotter than the light the 1.2K HMI was providing at 1/50th of a second,” he explains. “To do that with an HMI light, I would have had to have a huge HMI that required an electrician and it would have been more difficult to rig.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>Camera</strong></div>
        <div>Hemer shot with a Canon EOS 5D Mark II with a Canon TS-E 45mm f/2.8 tilt-shift lens at f/4.5. “I wanted to feel like I was in the room,” he says, and the 35mm and the focal length he chose for the lens worked well. In addition, the tilt-shift lens, which can be swung or tilted so it’s not parallel to the camera sensor, offers some of the controls that a view camera does. “The other nice thing about a tilt-shift lens is that I could swing the lens a little bit so I could keep the left side of the model a little softer and the side with the bed a little sharper,” Hemer adds. “It’s a great tool if you want to keep certain parts of a shot in focus but other parts slightly out of focus.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>To capture some motion blur around the girl scampering across the floor, he shot at 1/50th of a second with the camera on a tripod. He could have tried to add some softness to selected areas in post, he notes, “but it always looks fake on this scale.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><strong>Post Production</strong></div>
        <div>The digital tech on the shoot adjusted the color balance and levels, and that took care of most of the retouching needs. “There was very little post on this shot,” Hemer recalls. Though he prefers to capture everything in camera, on commercial assignments, he is often required to shoot plates and composite them to overcome a problem. For example, he says, “I might have to shoot a dining room table that’s set for six, but the company only has three chairs.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>On this Crate and Barrel shoot, he says he was happy with the image he got in camera. “The stylist was able to create a bed that looked natural but also inviting. That’s not easy to achieve.” He notes, “For what I do, stylists are indispensable, and set builders are unsung heroes.”</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[The challenges of photography book publishing are well known. Print runs are low, production costs are high, and bookstores and online retailers are pressing for discounts. The rule of thumb in the book industry is that the cost of producing the book equals 20 percent of the retail price. Depending on the number of images to be reproduced, paper stock and size, type of binding, and other factors that raise the cost of production, the publisher can either charge a prohibitively high price for the book, or find another way to defray its costs.
<p>“With the disappearance of so many independent local booksellers and the downward pressure exerted by large chains and Amazon.com, publishers can no longer afford to take chances on a new artist,” wrote photographer <a href="http://www.dlkphotography.com/">David Lykes Keenan</a> on his Kickstarter page. “In response, a new model has been born: the artist-funded book.”</p>
<p>“That’s where Kickstarter and you come in.”</p>
<p>One of thousands of photographers taking to the crowdfunding site, Keenan launched a campaign this spring to raise $24,000 to bring his book of street photographs, to be titled Fair Witness, to market. “If it is successful,” he wrote, “the Italian publisher <a href="http://www.damianieditore.com/">Damiani Editore</a> will make the book part of their Spring 2015 catalogue.”</p>
<p>Photographers using crowdfunding to raise money for creative projects isn’t new. What’s notable is that Keenan is using the site to fund a commercial endeavor: The money would pay all of Damiani Editore’s printing and production costs.</p>
<p>“I am excited to have this opportunity to see the book—with the imprint of a major publisher on the spine—come to life,” wrote Keenan, who has promoted the campaign via his Twitter account and generated press on photo blogs. “If the campaign is successful, the print run will be 1,000 books.”</p>
<p>About crowdfunding to pay for producing books, Damiani president Andrea Albertini says via Skype from Bologna, “This is very common in the U.S.—and it works.” Four or five books published by Damiani in the past two years were funded by money the photographers raised through Kickstarter.</p>
<p>Albertini says, “Sometimes we’re a service for the gallery, the artist, the museum.” Damiani has published monographs by many well-known photographers but, as Albertini tells it, there are artists who need a little extra funding and “those who, like David, if they don’t make the goal, it’s not possible to produce their work.”</p>
<p>Albertini explains, “He’s unknown. This is someone who retired and became a photographer. Now he has a dream to have a book. I’m helping him—because the book is nice! But of course I can’t pay for it.”</p>
<p>“It’s a hard business to get a book off the ground,” says Lesley Martin, publisher of the book program run by the <a href="http://www.aperture.org/">Aperture Foundation</a> and of The PhotoBook Review. “Not every book needs funding, but for those that do, photographers should think creatively and be willing to partner with organizations or publishers to think of the best way to do it.”</p>
<p>At Aperture, a nonprofit, that support may come in the form of government or foundation grants, donations from the board, their limited-edition print program, or partnering with galleries or others. “What we don’t do,” Martin says, “is [let] a photographer … come to us and say, ‘I’m going to write you a check, publish my book.’”</p>
<p>Rather, the photographers they publish engage in what Martin calls collaborative fundraising. “It’s a shared investment and something a photographer should really be able to put their shoulder into, whether it’s just opening up their Rolodex or helping us strategize about limited-edition prints. There are lots of ways to slice and dice a project.”</p>
<p>One of those ways has been crowdfunding. Aperture launched its first Kickstarter campaign in 2013 with a project particularly suited to the platform, the viral success <em>Touching Strangers</em>, for which photographer <a href="http://www.renaldi.com/">Richard Renaldi</a> asked strangers to pose making physical contact with one another. In a video on the project’s page, Chris Boot, executive director of Aperture, earnestly tells the viewer, “Aperture publishes about 20 books every year. We rely on the support of friends and patrons to make this possible. In Richard’s case, with this work, given it’s about the possibility of human connection, we thought, why not use Kickstarter to reach out to you, strangers, to make this book happen? Please help make this book happen.” Aperture then promoted the project through its network of members and via social media.</p>
<p>The project quickly soared past its $10,000 goal to earn a total of $80,943 from 885 backers. Backers received thank-you gifts ranging from acknowledgment in the book and a launch party invitation to a limited-edition print and signed copy of the book. As a result of the exposure the campaign generated, Aperture doubled their original estimated print run.</p>
<p>“Kickstarter started a viral campaign for Richard’s book and it showed us the possibilities for a larger audience above and beyond what we might have anticipated,” says Martin. “We’ve come to look at Kickstarter not just as a fundraising tool to fill gaps where funds are needed, but also as an important way to pre-sell the book and to expand the market outside our traditional photographic audience.”</p>
<p>Aperture has since launched one additional campaign, for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aperturefoundation/amelia-and-the-animals-photographs-by-robin-schwar">Robin Schwartz</a>’s <em>Amelia and the Animals</em>, a charming project showing Schwartz’s daughter interacting with exotic wildlife, due this fall. Going forward, Martin expects that of Aperture’s 30 annual releases, two or three will be supported by Aperture-run Kickstarter campaigns.</p>
<p>She also acknowledges that the move had its detractors. “I’m aware there’s a hesitancy or a bias that institutions should not use Kickstarter as a vehicle to fund projects, that it’s really intended for individuals,” she says. “We got some flak about that. But when you look at it, Kickstarter is a larger funder of cultural projects than the NEA [National Endowment for the Arts].”</p>
<p>Some publishers choose to pre-sell copies of books, lowering their costs and risks. Damiani’s Albertini, for example, says his house may require a photographer or his or her gallery or museum to pre-purchase a quantity of books: “The artist or the gallery … might pay us [for] a thousand copies.” At a 50 percent discount, a hundred copies of a $50 book brings the publisher $2,500. A thousand clears $25,000, enough to cover a small print run and sell half of it. “We do a quantity for them,” says Albertini, “and a quantity for us, for the market.”</p>
<p>Brooklyn-based <a href="http://www.powerhousebooks.com/">powerHouse Books</a>, whose output ranges from fine-art photography to peppy impulse buys like <em>Metal Cats</em>—a current smash featuring heavy-metal aficionados and their fluffy friends—also runs a trade with artists in books, in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>Founder and publisher Daniel Power says that as long as they believe they can sell a minimum quantity—a good portion of a 1,000- or 1,500-print run—they don’t ask the photographer to subsidize production costs.</p>
<p>Yet if the house sees potential in a project, “but not enough to pay for everything the artist wants—to make it really big or deluxe,” they will ask the artist to contribute to cover those costs. Power says less than 5 percent of powerHouse’s books are “photographer-subvented” (that is, subsidized by the photographer), and these are in cases where the photographer asked for a large trim size, a slipcase, more images, or other costly “bells and whistles.” The publishing house uses a formula to produce and price a book to fit within their model; if production costs would make the retail price more than the market can bear, the artist chips in to fund production. “Because sales alone are not going to cover all of it,” Power says, “and we weren’t put on this planet to promote you or bring your stuff to market. We need to share the responsibility.”</p>
<p>Power declines to reveal how much a photographer might contribute, but notes that in one instance, a photographer helped support a book by arranging for a large organization to buy copies of the book in advance—enough to lower the per-unit cost on each book. In return, the photographer received a royalty that was higher than the usual 10 to 15 percent of books sold.</p>
<p>Other publishers take different approaches. “I wouldn’t ask a photographer to fund a publication of their own work,” says Chris Pichler, owner of <a href="http://www.nazraeli.com/">Nazraeli Press</a>, which has published books in print runs ranging from 250—“which may be sold at very high prices”—to 3,000 copies. Pichler says, “If I can’t see selling a book in a standard print run to a combination of bookstores, galleries, libraries and individuals, and if it’s not the right kind of work for a small-run, more ‘collectible’ edition, then I would be ignoring common sense if I were to publish it.”</p>
<p>John Jenkins, publisher of <a href="http://www.decodebooks.com/">DECODE Books</a>, notes, “If you’re not making money back by traditional means, then you have to find other ways of doing it.” But in the model that requires the photographer to pay, he says, “you’re basically hiring the publisher to publish the book. You’re buying their distribution channels to get it out there.”</p>
<p>When DECODE launched in 2007, Jenkins, a longtime photo collector, committed to a different solution. For each of the two or three monographs the imprint publishes annually, the press’s authors make available one or two prints for sale as limited editions. These sell for up to $1,000 each and defray the cost of the book.</p>
<p>Without them, “I would not make my money back,” Jenkins says. “With the economics of a 1,000- or 1,500-book print run, you can’t make the money back just through sales, especially when they’re being distributed and sold through bookstores,” which take a cut of each sale.</p>
<p>Will he ever try Kickstarter? “I’m still struggling with it,” he says. “But when established publishers like Aperture are doing it, it makes me wonder, ‘Why am I not doing it too?’”</p>]]></article_text>

            <article_text><![CDATA[“Umma”—which means “mother” in Korean—is a photo series by South Korean-born, Brooklyn-based photographer <a href="http://goseongchoi.com/">Goseong Choi</a>. Ostensibly a meditation on his grandmother’s sudden illness and lingering death, “Umma” is at once austere and intimate, brimming with undercurrents of loss, family and filial duty. Eschewing easy sentiment, Choi’s images lay bare the wrenching power of a matriarch grieving for her own mother.
<p>In December 2010, Choi began photographing his family in their daily domestic routines. His previous work was conceptual and carefully composed, but Choi was eager to step outside of his own box. “I challenged myself to take more personal … raw images because the work I used to do in the past was very quiet,” he explains. “So I started to make snapshots of my family.” As fate would cruelly have it, a month after he turned his lens onto his family, Choi’s grandmother was struck down by a stroke and slipped into a coma from which she would not recover.</p>
<p>All of the images in “Umma” were taken in the three weeks between his grandmother’s hospitalization in Yongin, South Korea, and her burial at the family cemetery in Paju: The sterile purgatory of the hospital waiting room, anxiety thick in the recycled air; his mother, captured in a bedroom mirror, numbly smoothes makeup around her heavy eyes, her gaze far away; as mourners greet kin in the funeral home’s soft light, a coffin sits at the edge of the camera’s focus, heaped with wreaths and flowers; stubborn patches of snow cling to frostbitten grass as men shovel turned red earth into a grave.</p>
<p>During that time, although Choi kept his camera with him, respect for his family and an intrusively loud shutter on his DSLR led him to shoot sparingly. He admits that the camera also served as an emotional shield—even the simple act of observing and waiting for the right moment to shoot was an escape. Unsurprisingly, his own process in creating “Umma” was fraught with internal conflict.</p>
<p>“Perhaps I hid myself behind the camera. It was an escape to have some distance from this intense situation,” Choi explains, “but at the same time, guilt came over me. As an artist, I was happy to be making artwork out of this powerful occurrence, [but] there was a conflict between [the] roles of an artist and a grandson.”</p>
<p>For a photographer whose previous work included muted still-life photographs, finding a way to capture the raw emotion of a family tragedy was difficult. Simply taking portraits where he was physically very close to his subjects made Choi feel uncomfortable. Despite all this, Choi says his family was very supportive. His father especially encouraged the project, lamenting the fact that he never had any photographs of his own mother’s funeral.</p>
<p>After those three weeks, Choi did not immediately examine the images. “I think the fascinating part of photography is in the gap between projection and realization. I work intuitively and I don’t look at images for a few days, and sometimes a few weeks,” he explains. “Especially for this work, it took even longer. I needed time to digest overflowing emotion and have an objective point of view.”</p>
<p>After a month or two, Choi returned to the work and determined that, given the small number of images, careful editing would be key. He wanted to focus on his mother’s grief. He also knew that he didn’t want “Umma” to become a presentation of a traditional Korean funeral. As such, Choi explains that he excised images that were “too descriptive,” instead seeking to highlight the “universal language” of loss.</p>
<p>Choi took the work to the <a href="http://www.photolucida.org/">Photolucida</a> portfolio reviews in 2013, held in Portland, Oregon. He was able to get the series in front of several curators, editors and publishers for valuable feedback, something that often doesn’t happen in small group shows. Choi was also was elated at the opportunity to interact and compare<br />
work with his photography peers in the U.S.</p>
<p>Portland’s <a href="http://www.blueskygallery.org/">Blue Sky Gallery</a>, which hosted Photolucida’s closing reception, caught Choi’s eye. Impressed by the esthetics of the space and the quality of the art they were showing, he made a formal submission. Blue Sky’s exhibition committee had already noted his work during the event’s Portfolio Walk and eagerly accepted his application. “We have a rolling online submission process for exhibitions,” explains Blue Sky’s executive director Todd Tubutis, “so it is helpful to the committee when someone has seen an artist’s prints in person and can attest to their quality.” “Umma” and another of Choi’s series, “Meji” (photographs of burned and cropped fields in a rural village), are showing this month at the gallery.</p>
<p>Given that “Umma” was shot and edited in 2011 but is only now finding a wider audience, Choi has had plenty of time to move past his initial inner conflicts with the work and see it in a new light. He credits this project with having pointed him in a new direction as an artist. “I learned that I should face things uncomfortable and unbearable,” he says. “This attitude and sincerity amplified my voice in the work.”</p>
<p>The pain that surrounded the creation of the images has been replaced with a certainty that his grandmother’s spirit was working through him. Eventually he worked up the courage to invite his family to see an exhibition of “Umma.” “I was afraid that it could hurt my mother’s heart,” Choi says. “She slowly walked around the gallery and looked into each piece, and said only one thing: ‘Look at the wrinkles on my face!’”</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[The protesters stand in motley, improvised armor, homemade tactical vests and mismatched headgear. Their irregular camouflage and black uniforms are enlivened by splashes of yellow and blue, the colors of the Ukrainian national flag. Mourners are shrouded in black, with pale, stricken faces and flowers clutched in heavy hands. These are the faces of Euromaidan, the ongoing protests in Kiev’s Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) that turned violent earlier this year and are captured in documentary photographer <a href="http://www.anastasiataylorlind.com/">Anastasia Taylor-Lind</a>’s new book, <em><a href="http://www.gostbooks.com/books/44/maidan-portraits-from-the-black-square">Maidan: Portraits from the Black Square</a></em> (GOST Books, 2014).
<p>There is a touch of genius in Taylor-Lind’s decision to erect a black curtain and start shooting portraits in the middle of a battlefield. The result is transformative: Men and women are suspended in the eye of a storm, removed from the burning barricades and smoke-filled streets that appear in countless images of conflicts.<br />
These photographs quiet the din of war and the background noise of politics, however briefly, and allow the viewer to appreciate the individuals who created a popular movement. Taylor-Lind arrived in Kiev on February 4 to work on an unrelated project but was quickly caught up in documenting the civil unrest as the Euromaidan movement grew to a fever pitch. “I started to realize that what was happening in [Independence Square] was so visual and so dramatic that the way people had begun to prepare themselves for battle was being lost in the setting,” she explains. “That’s when I thought of removing the background altogether by using a black curtain.”</p>
<p>Lacking an appropriate backdrop for her medium-format photographs, Taylor-Lind tried everything, from hanging a piece of cloth in a burned-out bus shelter to attempting to use the reverse side of a large reflector. But her jerry-rigging was for naught. When she returned to London after weeks in Kiev, she found that both her Hasselblad and Bronica cameras had broken imperceptibly just as she began taking portraits of people from the square. Out of more than a hundred exposures she made, only five were usable. Taylor-Lind credits this crushing setback with making her even more determined to see her new project through. Cameras fixed, she left England with a stockpile of film and a professional studio backdrop and arrived back in Kiev on February 19, in the midst of the bloodiest clashes of the nation’s post-Soviet era. The very next day, protesters drove riot police from the city center and snipers left bodies strewn across Independence Square.</p>
<p>“Everything was on fire and there was very heavy fighting,” Taylor-Lind recalls. “I was [also] on assignment for a German newspaper, so the first two days I spent shooting reportage. Then on Saturday, when the president stepped down and things seemed quieter, I set up my studio and began in earnest.”</p>
<p>The most indispensable element of the pop-up studio was Taylor- Lind’s Ukrainian assistant and fixer Emine Ziyatdinova, a talented photojournalist in her own right. Every morning, they carried their equipment to a location that had little foot traffic but was close enough to the main thoroughfare to easily approach prospective subjects. Initially nearly all of them were male protesters in their salvaged armor. But after Kiev fell into a spasm of violence, many more Ukrainians came to the barricades—not to fight, but to mourn the lives lost. It was the women with their flowers who Taylor-Lind focused on then. She admits that she cried alongside every grieving woman she photographed.</p>
<p>Wanting also to “share the experience of being a photographer” as it happened, Taylor-Lind photographed her notebooks and made videos that she posted on Instagram. She also used her iPhone to shoot through the viewfinder of her Bronica, eventually using a makeshift mount that Ziyatdinova created with repurposed tripod parts to attach the phone to her film camera. “There were all these things happening in Maidan square and I wasn’t going to be able to show anyone any of them until several weeks later,” she explains. “So the photographs I made with my iPhone meant that I could show pictures as events were unfolding. The technology allowed me to add that extra dimension that I wouldn’t have if I was just shooting film.”</p>
<p>In the past, images for upcoming assignments were carefully guarded secrets. Today, however, magazines often request that photographers contribute to the publication’s Instagram account—a cultural shift in the world of photojournalism, according to Taylor-Lind. And though she admits that she is “a bit of a traditionalist” and shoots rolls of 120-format film with a medium-format camera, her social media engagement has been both enjoyable and prudent. In Kiev, she found fixers through Instagram and subjects were able to follow her. Perhaps most importantly, she built an audience for her book from the ground up by publishing her <a href="http://instagram.com/anastasiatl">iPhone images</a> on TIME Lightbox, Instagram’s blog and other digital outlets.</p>
<p>Fellow photographer Larry Towell, with whom she shared an apartment in Kiev, sparked the idea for the book by commenting on her iPhone images. The offhanded remark planted a seed that grew as Taylor-Lind began to realize that by the time she got back to England and processed the film, the images would likely be too dated for submission in today’s fast-paced news cycle.</p>
<p>“When I returned [to London] I realized these pictures were the most precious pictures, to me, that I had ever made,” Taylor-Lind says. “Of all the work I ever made, I just felt so differently about them, I wanted to make sure they were seen the right way.” Emboldened by her faith in her work, Taylor-Lind approached Stuart Smith, codirector of the London photography and visual arts publishing house GOST Books. Smith and his partner Gordon MacDonald told her that they wanted to strike while the iron was hot.</p>
<p>With the situation in Ukraine far from resolved, Taylor-Lind’s first instinct was to return and continue to document the unrest. But she and the publisher soon agreed that the book was about “one very particular segment of time, in a very limited geographical range, and that [story] was finished now,” she says.</p>
<p>Only a few months have passed since Taylor- Lind shot these photographs, but already the events of Euromaidan have been eclipsed by the widening crisis in Ukraine. Even in Kiev, many have tired of the protesters who remain in Independence Square, and ugly infighting has replaced the clarity of those early, heady days. But Taylor-Lind’s indelible portraits keep alive the energy in the air, hearts and mouths of the Ukrainians who manned the barricades and mourned their dead during those days of fire.</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <em>The following article first appeared in a slightly different form on the blog of cinematographer Ryan E. Walters, <a href="http://www.ryanewalters.com/Blog/blog.php">http://www.ryanewalters.com/Blog/blog.php</a></em>
        <p>Thanks to many innovations in technology, digital cinema cameras are continuing to improve in quality by leaps and bounds. However, the pristine images that these cameras deliver have introduced a new problem that we haven’t had to think about until now: The images are getting too good. They are too clean. Read on for why I think this is a problem, and what to do about it.</p>
        <p>One of the reasons why people, myself included, enjoy the esthetic of film is due to its “organic” nature. While people might use this term to describe different qualities of film, I think a lot of the time it is a highbrow way of saying “technical imperfection.” Film by its very nature is an imprecise medium. It does not have a hard cutoff point in the highlights; it gracefully rolls off. Digital, on the other hand, is very precise.</p>
        <p>When it hits that clipping point in the highlights, all of the information is gone. Film is developed through the exposing and developing of silver crystals on a thin membrane. The formation of these crystals is never exactly the same. So even in a completely static shot, every individual frame is unique as the film grain does not align itself in exactly the same pattern. With digital, however, it is either a 1 or a 0; it is exact. This level of precision takes away a lot of the “organic-ness” that film brings with it. When you add amazingly clean and perfect modern glass to this digital “problem,” it ends up creating a technically pristine, clinical image that is free of character and free of life.</p>
        <p>One of the ways that camera manufacturers have addressed, or contributed to, this “problem” is through their use of optical low-pass filters (OLPF). Having worked with the ARRI Alexa and Red Epic cameras quite a bit, I can say that the Alexa has a stronger OLPF than the Epic. While I haven’t done side-by-side testing to prove this yet, the highlights from the Alexa roll off and bloom in a much more pleasant way than the Epic’s less strong, and thus more precise, OLPF. From my research and conversations with people in the know at Red and elsewhere, it is the Alexa’s stronger OLPF that contributes to part of this camera’s look. This brings up an interesting issue with the Blackmagic Cinema Camera. From the reports I’ve heard, Blackmagic is either using a very weak, or no, OLPF on the camera. This means a tack-sharp pristine image.</p>
        <p>So how do I add life and a more organic nature to the digital imagery that I produce? My recipe calls for a four-part mixture of lighting, lensing, filtration and grading that are all mixed together in combinations that support the story.</p>
        <p><strong>Lighting</strong><br />
        About 70 to 80 percent of the final look that I get in my work comes from my lighting. When I first began, I was much more concerned about technical precision in my lighting and making sure that perfect exposure was maintained through the frame. But as I’ve grown in my profession, I’ve realized that great lighting is as much about the places in between the light as it is about where the light exists. So I’ve moved away from worrying about always being technically precise at every point in the frame. What this has done for me is that it has allowed me to move toward a more natural and organic lighting style. (This should not be confused with sloppiness in lighting. I still meter my setups and make sure that I hit specific values within my frame.)</p>
        <p><strong>Lensing</strong><br />
        Another 10 to 20 percent of the look that I get comes from my lens choices. I spend a lot of time researching, testing and evaluating the characteristics that lenses bring to the final image. If it is appropriate for the project, one of my favorite combinations these days is to use old lenses on digital cinema cameras. The imprecision that these lenses have in their optics and the degradation in the lens coatings can add life and personality back into an otherwise sterile image. There is a time and place for modern glass, but nothing can replace or replicate the look that an older lens will bring to the footage. Oftentimes, the softness that older lenses add to the look of digital cameras is just what is needed to help replicate that organic nature of the “film look.” And other times, the unique flares produced can add a new dimension to the image. EBay can be a great place to score deals on older lenses, but as more and more people catch on to this idea, these affordable lenses have increased in price. If eBay is not your thing, then one of my favorite dealers in old cinema glass is Kevin Cameras. (I know, I probably should have kept that secret to myself, instead of increasing the competition.)</p>
        <p><strong>Filtration</strong><br />
        The next 10 to 20 percent of my personal esthetic comes from the use of filtration. As with my testing of lenses, I’m always testing filtration to see what kinds of looks I can create in camera. With every piece of glass that is added in front of the lens comes an additional element that changes and mars the image in a unique way. I have also used filtration to match modern lenses with the look of older lenses. When I shot the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7_KpPRyBs">Blackstar Warrior</a>” trailer, I only had one adapter and one set of Cooke S2/S3 lenses available to me, but we were shooting on two Red Ones. (The second camera had a set of Red Pro Primes.) During the preproduction testing, I found that a Schneider 1/8 Classic Soft and a 1/4 Coral matched the Cooke S2/ S3s well. (The second BTS video from that production can be viewed on my blog.) Watch the video and see if you can tell which shot was with the Cookes and which was with the Red Pro Primes using filtration.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Grading</strong><br />
        The last 5 to 10 percent of my style comes from the final grade. (Yes, I know my percentages can add up to more than 100 percent. The point is to indicate where I derive most of my style from.) The look I get in my footage is mostly generated in camera. The final grade is then used to enhance what is already there. While a lot can be done in the grade to create various looks and styles, to date, none of the results that I have seen come close to replicating the organic nature (technical imprecision) that I can achieve by creating most of the look in camera first. So for me, the grade is about finessing and unifying the look, rather than creating it from scratch. One little trick I’ve had done on some of my projects lately has been to overlay actual film grain as the last step before outputting the final deliverable. This adds back in some additional texture to the video, enhancing that technical imprecision—aka its “organicness.” This should be done with a light touch, and it is best to use real film grain, from people like Grain35, Gorilla Grain or R-Grain. (The digital film grain plugin generators look fake and just don’t work, in my opinion.)</p>
        <p><strong>Wrap Up</strong><br />
        I realize that esthetic taste is a highly subjective thing, and my approach may not be right for you. You may prefer the ultra pristine look that you can get from digital cameras, which is great! But if you are looking for a way to add some character and personality back into your footage, then add in some lighting, lensing, filtration, grading and season to taste. Then you will be well on your way to creating nuanced imagery that will have life pulsating through every frame.</p>

        <strong>Client:</strong> <em>Cosmopolitan Fashion UK</em><br />
        <strong>Fashion Director:</strong> Shelly Vella
        <p><a href="http://www.tomcorbettphoto.com/">Tom Corbett</a> loves to infuse his fashion images with energy, fun and a touch of irreverence. He achieves his characteristic look by creating a relaxed atmosphere on set and using light in unexpected ways. “If I had to choose my favorite way to shoot in the studio, I’d say I like to keep it spontaneous,” says the Australian-born, New York City-based photographer.</p>
        <p>His look can be seen in recent work for <em>Cosmopolitan UK Fashion</em>, an assignment on which he collaborated with long-time client Shelly Vella, the magazine’s fashion director. Vella showed him the clothes and suggested model Kyla Moran, and Corbett proposed using graphic, black-and-white backdrops. Though the bold stripes and polka dots suggested the Mod fashions of the Sixties, Corbett and Vella did not want the lighting to look retro. “We felt that was too expected,” Corbett says. To give the shots “a slightly more modern twist,” he chose to use a ring flash as his primary light source.</p>
        <p>“Not only does it make the clothes look really good—it flattens creases and it brings a kind of sparkle—but it adds energy,” he explains. “That’s why it can be a really useful light.”</p>
        <p>As he’s refined his ring flash technique, he often likes to move it off the camera lens, where it’s typically used, or mix it with other sources. “It is nice to take something and change it slightly with a twist,” he says. “That’s the idea behind all the lighting I do.”</p>
        <p>Corbett notes that while he has his favorite light sources, “One tool is never going to be right for everything.” For a recent <em>Essence</em> magazine story celebrating the beauty of curvaceous women, for example, he worked very differently than on the <em>Cosmopolitan Fashion UK</em> shoot: His set was quieter, he used simple gray backdrops, and he chose a moodier, softer light that he modified to increase shadows and outline the curves on his subjects’ bodies.</p>
        <p><strong>Logistics</strong><br />
        Corbett worked closely with prop stylist Erin Swift, who painted the black-and-white patterns on 8x8 flats—except for the polka dots, which she painted directly onto the cyc wall in Corbett’s studio. Corbett photographed Moran close to the backdrops. “When the background is too far from the ring flash, it starts to get muddy, and then you have to throw a lot of light on the background,” he explains.<br />
        “It suddenly feels staged and lit.”</p>
        <p>When it comes to directing his models, Corbett says he looks for “the half-moment, something that’s real and not posed.” On the <em>Cosmopolitan Fashion UK</em> shoot, he kept up a lively banter with the model and crew, and also used a technique that he’s used before to draw out models’ personalities: He told Moran to imagine she is in a photo booth, getting casual snapshots taken. “The idea is to tell the model she’s with a couple of mates. ‘Don’t worry too much about the clothes, have some fun with it and see what we get,’” he explains. “By doing that you get truly spontaneous moments.”</p>
        <p><strong>Lighting</strong><br />
        The light from the ring flash can look “raw,” so Corbett often mixes it with another light source. “There’s a ratio of soft light that goes in there,” he says. He has a wall made of multiple softboxes that was designed and built for him by lighting assistants he’s worked with on many jobs over the years.</p>
        <p>This is positioned behind his camera to cast a soft light. On the <em>Cosmopolitan Fashion UK</em> shoot, it softened the ring flash and gave it more polish. For his softboxes, he says he prefers to work with Broncolor. “With the amount of movement I get, I can change [the flash duration] easily.”</p>
        <p>While the lighting for <em>Cosmopolitan Fashion UK</em> was poppy, he needed more contrast and shadow on the <em>Essence</em> assignment. “We wanted to really define the women’s curves, not to shy away from them,” he recalls.</p>
        <p>Shooting the models against simple gray backgrounds, he used a Broncolor Para 220. “It’s basically a hard light in a big, soft umbrella. You get beautiful skin tone, but you don’t get multiple fall off [shadows].” To create the vignetting behind each model, he used 2x4 black cards to block some of the light from hitting the background. “If you put the shadow in the right place, it outlines the shape in a positive way,” he explains.</p>
        <p><strong>Camera</strong><br />
        Corbett uses a Canon 1Dx, f/11 at 100. He always shoots handheld and works quickly. “When I’m on a tripod, I feel lazy. There may be an angle I haven’t explored, and then in a moment it’s gone,” he says. “I find that the longer you take getting a picture, the less natural it becomes.”</p>
        <p>In photographing plus-size models for <em>Essence</em>, the typical method would be to use a long lens and stand further away, “but that was a bit too expected,” Corbett says. Instead he used a Canon 24-700 mm at around 35mm “to really accentuate her hips. It gave it a little twist.”</p>
        <p><strong>Retouching</strong><br />
        Corbett typically shoots tethered, and his long-time digital tech and retoucher Edward Caruso previews the images. On the <em>Cosmopolitan Fashion UK</em> shoot, he and Vella selected their favorites on the spot. “We have such a productive relationship and we’ve worked together for so many years, nine times out of ten, we’ll choose the images on the set.” When Caruso showed him the retouched images of Moran, Corbett asked him to lighten up on the retouching, “but they still looked retouched. She’s got perfect skin and perfect makeup,” he says, referring to Moran and the effect the ring flash created in making her glow.</p>

        <p class="p1">In the crowded market of women’s interest magazines, women’s health stands out for its focus on health and fitness and for its clean, stylish photography. since 2005, photo director Sarah Rozen<strong> </strong>has led the magazine’s photo team. before joining women’s health, Rozen was photo director at Fast Company and entertainment weekly. she was also the founding photo director of who weekly in Australia and has worked at People. she talks to PDN about the wide variety of photography she assigns.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>What’s the editorial mission of <em>Women’s Health</em>, and who are its readers?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>Sarah Rozen: </strong></span><em>Women’s Health </em>covers all aspects of a woman’s life: health, fitness, nutrition, relationships, beauty, fashion.</p>
        <p class="p2">Our readers are active, healthy women. Our stories cover all those aspects of life, and what’s great about the photography is that it relates to all those stories. What’s interesting for me is that the photography is not just one thing. It’s not just cooking and still life; it’s fashion, it’s a little bit of celebrity. It’s a nice variety and I think it makes the magazine interesting. <em>Women’s Health </em>takes risks with new photographers and assigning photographers to stories that aren’t the typical work they are known for.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>The fitness stories in <em>Women’s Health </em>look fashion forward. Is that fair to say?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>SR: </strong></span>Generally for our fitness section, we’re picking people who aren’t typically known for shooting fitness. They may be more known for shooting, say, fashion and will approach fitness in a new way, people like Tom Schirmacher or Juan Algarin. We’ve worked with Richard Phibbs. I think we’ve gotten incredible results from it.</p>
        <p class="p2">We assigned Williams <span class="s3">+ </span>Hirakawa to do a kind of “Mad Max” story. We were looking for a location, and our fashion director, Jacqueline Azria, suggested those windmills you see when driving to Palm Springs [California]. They shot half of it out there and half of it in a parking lot where they set up a studio. The story is very futuristic and has a cool feel. Williams <span class="s3">+ </span>Hirakawa had done a straight fashion story for me the year before, but I wanted them to do something completely different for me here.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>What are some of the sections of the magazine you’re assigning photography for? <br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>SR: </strong></span>As I said, the magazine covers relationships, nutrition, beauty, fitness, and each section of the magazine is divided into those topics. So in our front-of-the-book section called Scoops, there will be news and bulletins on beauty, relationships and so on. Then before you go to our feature well, you go to our style section. It’s a mix of still lifes and images shot on models. There might be a think piece there as well. Claire Benoist shot a story for us on how to be careful when working out after an injury. She got creative with it, shooting fitness equipment and Band-Aids.</p>
        <p class="p2">Our Healthy Dose, Know it All, Nutrition and food sections are big areas we assign.</p>
        <p class="p2">We do some lifestyle photography in the front of the book, but a lot is conceptual still life, because it’s both economical to produce and a great way to get a concept across.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>How much of the book is assigned, and how much is pick up?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>SR: </strong></span>I’d say we assign 60 to 70 percent of the magazine, and pick up is maybe 30 to 40 percent.Some of the lifestyle in the front of the book is pick up from a bigger shoot, such as a fashion shoot, or we might do a big shoot for front-of-the-book stories.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>How does that work?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>SR: </strong></span>If a photographer is going to do a shoot, we might say we’ll need two shots for one story, and two shots for another. If the shoot is taking place in a studio, we’ll shoot both in the studio. If it’s on location, we wouldn’t do them in multiple locations. We have to be realistic about what we can accomplish and what the photographers can accomplish.</p>
        <p class="p2">We usually work on two issues at a time, and shoot for specific stories. If we just shoot for non-specific future stories, it’s not as successful or useful.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>What determines when you choose to use existing imagery, and when you’re assigning?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>SR: </strong></span>We figure out what imagery exists and whether it can work with the story. We tend to assign features. For food, obviously, we are shooting specific recipes, so we assign those. Fashion stories are always assigned because we are showing specific clothes.</p>
        <p class="p2">When we do pick up, we have to consider where the images fall within the issue and how they work with the rest of the book.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>How do you define the magazine’s look?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>SR: </strong></span>It’s strong, bright and poppy—obviously, depending on the topic. We pay careful attention so that our models look real, not overly made up. They have nice muscle tone and they’re not too skinny. They look like women you’d want to be. When women work out, they don’t typically wear makeup, so when we shoot for ourselves we make sure the models look natural, but a little aspirational, too. We try the [stock] agencies sometimes, but we also love to go directly to photographers and see what they have for pick up. If we only went to the agencies, all magazines would be using all the same images. We try not to go to the regular five agencies. We want our photography to look individual.</p>
        <p class="p2">We have done some amazing conceptual still life to illustrate difficult topics, like domestic violence and a woman’s right to abortion. Some of the talent who have made these visuals so successful are Jamie Chung, Christopher Griffith, Stephen Lewis, Dan Forbes and Craig Cutler.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>Besides the magazine, are you getting photos for other uses?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>SR: </strong></span>We have an iPad edition, and <em>Women’s Health </em>has 23 international editions. There’s a contract person who negotiates photographers’ contracts.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>What’s the division of labor on your team?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>SR: </strong></span>The deputy photo director, Freyda Tavin, and I worked together at <em>Entertainment Weekly </em>and at <em>People</em>. She has worked on a lot of the big stories. Then we have Irene La Grasta and Brona Hatchette, who do a lot of the front of the book, and Elizabeth Semmens, who does a lot of the casting and production. We also work closely with the art department and the fashion director.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>are you assigning a regular stable of contributing photographers, or looking for new contributors?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>SR: </strong></span>Both. We have some photographers we go to regularly. Jeff Lipsky has done covers. Tom Schirmacher is someone we began working with often about a year ago. Ture Lillegraven we’ve been working with for seven or eight years. He’s someone I started to work with on women’s fashion stories when no one else used him for that, and he’s done an incredible job for us. There are many photographers who I have had a long relationship with, or the magazine has had a long relationship with, but we also like to bring in new people all the time.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>Where do you look for new photographers?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>SR: </strong></span>Probably the same places everyone does: magazines, galleries, blogs like A Photo Editor, TIME Lightbox and <em>The New York Times</em>’s Lens blog. Instagram is helpful—not for finding specific photos, but I’ll get interested in photographers and follow them, and it helps me find out what a photographer is interested in. I look at Le Book because I want to know who’s shooting or the fitness brands like Nike and Adidas. I think portfolio reviews are definitely useful. Recommendations from other photographers; a photographer will say, “I have a great assistant and you should see her work.” Recommendations from other photo editors. Promos I receive.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>You mean printed promotions?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>SR: </strong></span>Yes. I’m old school. I’ll also tear out something in a magazine that I like and put it on my board to remind me.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>You’ve talked a lot about cross assigning, but is there a type of photographer you’re always looking for?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>SR: </strong></span>We do so much beauty that we are always looking for new talent for beauty photography. Donna Trope has shot some amazing beauty for us. I’m always looking for great fashion photographers and for people who will shoot fitness and bring something new to the table. We want to keep it fresh. We have to stay ahead of the competition, and I feel like every time we do something new, the competition will follow us.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>What do you wish photographers better understood about shooting for magazines?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>SR: </strong></span>The big photo shoots are a big machine, in a way, and involve a lot of people. It’s not just about one person’s point of view, and sometimes my hands are tied. That doesn’t mean [photographers] can’t realize their artistic vision, but we have to work together, too. It can be amazing, but you might have to adapt a bit.</p>

        To help fund her new book, Jen Davis made 5x7-inch prints of “Untitled No. 41,” 2011, in an edition of 200 and sold them for $100 apiece. The image had not previously sold, and Davis's dealer, Lee Marks, pulled the image from her inventory.

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <p class="p1">When book publishers ask photographers to pay the cost of producing and printing a photography book, the artists often raise the money by selling prints or offering them as incentives in crowdfunding campaigns. Some book publishers pay for a trade edition by selling a more expensive “collector’s edition,” packaged with a signed and numbered print. There are several strategies to ensure these print offers don’t  affect the perceived value of the prints that galleries are selling. </p>
        <p class="p1">For <a href="http://www.lorinix.net/">Lori Nix</a>’s book <em>The City</em>, publishing house Decode Books sold 20 signed and numbered prints in a size smaller than Nix’s smallest gallery edition. The image, “Library,” had sold out in 2008. All of Nix’s galleries approved the selection, she says. “One, though, did voice some concern that those who had  bought the image when it was available may be upset to see such a discounted, though smaller, version. The thought was that since it was out of edition, this smaller-size image would not actively compete with larger versions.”</p>
        <p class="p1">To accompany the collector’s edition of his new book, <em>Horizons </em>(Hatje Cantz), photographer Sze Tsung Leong chose two images that he had not released before. These images, he says, “are not included in the book itself, and are a special size.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Before publishing her book, <em>Eleven Years</em>, <a href="http://www.jendavisphoto.com/">Jen Davis</a> raised some of the funding by selling a 5x7-inch print in an edition of 200 for $100. Davis and her dealer, Lee Marks, chose an image that was representative of the project but had not yet sold. Then, Marks says, “I pulled it from my inventory.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Robert Klein of Robert Klein Gallery, however, says it makes sense to choose a popular image for a collector’s edition: “You want the book to do well.” In addition to printing the image in a smaller size, he recommends using a different medium or paper for the print—an artist who makes silver gelatin prints, for example, could make an inkjet print. The goal is to make a print that represents you well, but won’t leave buyers confused by the discounted print you’re selling.</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <p class="p1">The fine-art market is based on scarcity. Although a photograph can be reproduced endlessly, artists limit their editions, giving buyers a guarantee that they will release a finite number of prints at a given size. “The collectors have to believe there’s integrity to what you’re selling, and the edition numbers have to mean something,” says Robert Klein, owner of Robert Klein Gallery. “That confidence is vital to sustaining a career in the fine-art photography world.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Limiting editions, however, means photographers have less inventory to sell. How should photographers balance the short-term goal of selling as many prints as possible against the long-term goals of preserving the value of their archives and creating a legacy for the future? Once an edition of prints sells out, “You can’t just print one for posterity,” says private dealer Lee Marks of Lee Marks Fine Art.</p>
        <p class="p1">Many photographers are reluctant to forego sales now when the vagaries of the market, and their own future prospects, are so unpredictable. “Am I keeping one or two prints for my retirement? I wish, but I’m usually so in need of money in the present, that I sell every print I can,” says Lori Nix, who has had several editions sell out. “I’m also hopeful, perhaps naively, that I will continue to make strong work when I’m in my 50s and 60s and so on.”</p>
        <p class="p1">The decision to sell or save is highly personal. “You have to take into account who the artist is, what their level of productivity is, what their financial needs are,” says Klein.</p>
        <p class="p1">We asked gallerists and photographers about their long-term strategy for print sales and learned the steps photographers can take to make informed decisions.</p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>The Importance of Record Keeping</strong></span></p>
        <p class="p1">It’s essential for artists to track how many prints they’ve sold or given away. That way, “If someone calls and says, ‘I like this image. Where is it in the edition?’ we know,” says Michael Foley of Foley Gallery. Whenever he signs new artists, Foley asks about the numbers and sizes of prints of each work that they’ve already sold or given to friends or family. “If we edition the work at the same size as the prints that are out there, we have to consider those part of the editions.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Photographer Jessica Todd Harper recorded her first sales in a notebook, then switched to an Excel spreadsheet. Although she is now represented by two galleries, she still keeps records herself. “The buck stops with the photographer—the gallery could go out of business, you could leave the gallery, but it’s your brand. It’s up to you.”</p>
        <p class="p1">When Nix updates her records, she shares them with her seven galleries. She believes that Excel is most efficient for “keeping track of prices, especially price increments.”</p>
        <p class="p1">All of the photographers and dealers interviewed for this story use stepped pricing: In an edition of ten, for example, prints 1 through 3 sell for the lowest price and numbers 4 through 6 cost more, up through the last print, which is “priced on request,” says Marks. Keeping accurate records about the status of a print—if it’s reserved for a prospective buyer, for example, or on loan for an exhibition—prevents mistakes, such as selling the third print in an edition for the price of the fourth.</p>
        <p class="p1">Foley says record keeping is simple. “Just make an Excel spreadsheet for the body of work, then next to each image, list the sizes and number.” The list could also be organized by year: “These are all the prints I made in 2014.” He recommends adding thumbnail images because “titles are hard to keep track of.” When he sells a print, he checks off the number or writes in the buyer’s name and shares the revised chart with other galleries representing the artist. If artists keep records “from the get-go,” he says, “it becomes habit.”</p>
        <p class="p2"><strong>What’s Yours to Give</strong></p>
        <p class="p1">In addition to the numbered prints in an edition, photographers make one or two “artist’s proofs.” The term comes from lithography, and in photography it originally referred to the final tests made after a photographer refined a print of a negative, Marks explains. Although artists have to disclose to buyers how many artist’s proofs (APs) exist, they are for the artist’s personal use and are traditionally not sold at the same time as the edition prints. Marks notes, “The French expression is <em>hors de commerce</em>, meaning ‘outside of business,’” (often abbreviated “HC”).</p>
        <p class="p1">“I think the artist’s proof should be hands off,” says Foley. “It goes in the safety deposit box to be used by the artist at a future date.” If a museum comes looking someday for an artist’s early work, Foley says, “I don’t want to say the editions are all sold out—and that the artist’s proofs are sold, too.”</p>
        <p class="p1">He offers a caveat, however. Once an edition sells out, the APs can sell for whatever the market will bear. “If an artist has a book project coming up or really needs funding and can sell this print for $8,000, maybe that’s a good investment.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Artists sometimes donate APs to charity auctions, too. “In a perfect world, you’d give your best work,” says photographer Julie Blackmon, but artists should consider how many prints of the image they have left.</p>
        <p class="p1">Photographer Jen Davis says that early in her career she often donated APs, some for images “that were already highly sold.” In hindsight, she says, “Perhaps I should have chosen a lesser-known photograph to give, or a smaller print.” Now, she checks first with Marks, her dealer, and chooses the causes and events she wants to support with care. (For information on how Davis and other photographers arranged for the sale of a particular print to help fund the publication of photo books, see "<a href="/Selling-Prints-to-Fu-11248.shtml">Selling Prints to Fund Books: It's Complicated</a>.")</p>
        <p class="p1">Marks says that charity auctions are “tricky”: “I don’t like to have things go for a third of what I’m selling them for.” Klein recommends making a separate “donation print” at a different size, so as not to “pollute the price structure of the market,” he says.</p>
        <p class="p2"><strong>Before the Last Print Sells</strong></p>
        <p class="p1">For the last print in an edition, a photographer can negotiate the current market value. But there are other considerations besides price. How photographers think about their equity or legacy is often a reflection of their career goals or their age.</p>
        <p class="p1">For new photographers, selling out an edition can build buyers’ confidence in their work, Klein says. For some more established artists in his gallery stable, however, the last print in an edition is reserved for “museums and prestigious collections,” he says.</p>
        <p class="p1">Photographer Sze Tsung Leong says he decides on an image-by-image basis what prints to keep for himself. “It’s extremely important to me that my work be part of public collections and that it be accessible to the public.” He adds, “Museums are also interested in a wider and more challenging range of images than collectors generally are.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Harper’s 2001 image “Self Portrait with Christopher and my Future In-Laws” is nearly sold out of its 16x20-inch edition of ten prints. Her APs are gone, too: “I traded one with an artist and gave the other to my gracious in-laws.” She has no regrets about letting it go. “I’m so over it. I don’t see it as my most interesting picture.” Her more recent work will be in an exhibition at Rick Wester Fine Art in New York City to coincide with the publication of her second book, <em>The Home Stage </em>(Damiani). “My main concern is always to make good work, and I assumed I’d continue making new work, and even better work.”</p>
        <p class="p1">“Photographers who have depth to their work will continue to make good work,” says Marks, but adds, “You’re going to make good work in the future, but it’ll be different.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Marks says that when photographer Davis first began her self-portrait series over a decade ago, “The last thing she was thinking about was her legacy.” She has now published the work in her first book, <em>Eleven Years </em>(Kehrer Verlag), has photos from the series in 20 museums and is making new work. Marks recently counseled Davis to consider saving some prints from the series: “The material is so brave and gutsy, I think it’s important to hang onto those.” Marks explains, “She might not come across an idea that resonates with as many people as that. The work may be just as good, but it might not sell as well. It may sell better, but who knows?”</p>
        <p class="p1">The market can be fickle. Nix says she has seen photography careers wax and wane. “Only time will tell if my work will rise in equity. Fingers crossed,” she says. “I think if I can continue to make work that is thought- provoking, relevant and desirable, then I am master of my equity.”</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        There are many artist residency programs around the U.S. for photographers, and among the most coveted are those offered by the <a href="http://www.cpw.org/">Center for Photography at Woodstock</a> (CPW) in upstate New York. Past residents include several photographers who have built successful careers, including LaToya ruby Frazier, Gerard H. Gaskin and Danny Tisdale.
        <p>“It has a history of being the top of the top,” says <a href="http://www.almaleiva.org/">Alma Leiva</a>, who won a four-week residency in the fall of 2012. She credits her CPW residency with helping her get a gallery show in europe, attract the notice of curators at Houston FotoFest and win another artist residency at The MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire last year. “The connections you make, that’s priceless,” Leiva says.</p>
        <p>CPW’s residencies are limited to “artists of color” from the U.S.—meaning artists who identify with a racial or ethnic minority. The reason, explains CPW executive Director Ariel Shanberg, is that the center “is committed to leveling the playing field in the arts and ensuring that our region [Hudson valley/Catskills] is accessible to the widest demographic of artists.”</p>
        <p>Space is limited. For photographers, there are just seven residencies per year, ranging from three to six weeks in duration. There’s also one residency available for curators or critics.</p>
        <p>Photographers are asked to submit a portfolio of ten to 15 digital images. Video artists must submit up to three videos of no more than five minutes’ duration. All applicants must submit an artist’s statement up to 500 words long, a CV and a residency proposal that addresses three specific questions: Why is it important for you to participate? (150 words); How do you plan to use the time? (300 words); What aspects of the residency will be most important to your goals? (150 words).</p>
        <p>Shanberg says applicants are judged “first and foremost” on the quality and cohesiveness of their work. After that, jurors review the proposals, and the successful ones demonstrate “a clear sense of purpose, a strong sense of time management, a realistic set of goals and interest in the communal aspect of CPW—being part of an artist-centered space,” Shanberg says.</p>
        <p>The most common reasons for rejection, he adds, include incomplete or vague proposals, and proposals lacking in substance. Applicants are sometimes rejected because CPW lacks the facilities they need. “Do your homework and understand what resources are available. That’s key,” Shanberg says.</p>
        <p>Leiva’s first piece of advice to photographers applying for any grant or fellowship is to follow the application instructions to the letter. “Make sure you’re sending what they’re asking for. If they see you’re missing a paper, or didn’t follow the form, they’re going to toss it aside and say, ‘This person isn’t serious.’”</p>
        <p>She also advises applicants to present their proposals in a neat, professional way. “It tells about your personality and work ethic.” Shanberg confirms the point. “Show that you’re organized and professional in your practice. When it comes to applying, it’s the most important thing,” he says.</p>
        <p>With regard to the substance of the application, Leiva and others who have won CPW residencies emphasize the importance of explaining in specific, concrete terms how they expected to benefit from the residency, and how they planned to use their time while there.</p>
        <p>Leiva applied with a plan to complete work on her ongoing project called “Celdas,” translated as “Prison Cells.” Using constructed living spaces and symbolism, the project explores the state of self-confinement that many illegal immigrants in the U.S. are driven to by the fear of deportation.</p>
        <p>She said in her application that she wanted to complete two more images in the series while at CPW. She described in detail the images that she envisioned, and the sets she proposed to build. She also included a week-by- week schedule—including time for set building, shooting and scanning.</p>
        <p>Her proposal “sounded realistic,” she says. “Some people get carried away: ‘I want to do this, I want to do that.’ And you don’t have enough time, so [jurors] think, ‘Oh, she’s just trying to get in, she’s desperate so she will say anything.’”</p>
        <p>Photographer <a href="http://mariabuyondo.com/">Maria Buyondo</a> won a four-week residency in 2013 to make an artist’s book of images about her grandmother that explores “loss of memory and escape from reality,” according to her artist’s statement. She hadn’t yet shot the project when she applied, so she submitted some of her video works with her application.</p>
        <p>She explained in her application that she wanted the residency because, “I don’t have a printer. Without CPW’s printing facility, I wouldn’t have been able to make an artist’s book.” She also said she lacked the know-how to make a book, so she was seeking expert help from CPW. And she said she needed the time at CPW to focus on the project, free of the daily distractions of living and working at home in New York City. Buyondo says she had a non-artist friend read her application before she sent it in. “Have someone who doesn’t speak the language [of art] read the artist statement and project description,” she advises. “They’ll tell you if it makes sense or if it doesn’t make sense,” and help you edit the application for clarity.</p>
        <p>Photographer <a href="http://www.calebferguson.com/">Caleb Ferguson</a> won a CPW residency in 2012 to start a new project, not long after finishing a project about the Occupy movement. “My proposal was to look at why the mainstream media pits Wall Street against Main Street,” he says. “I specifically wanted the time and space away from the urban [environment]”—he lives in New York City—”to look at the rural.”</p>
        <p>He proposed shooting stills and video and conducting interviews with the people he met for a multimedia production at the end of the project. He specified five towns he wanted to explore, and submitted a schedule for both shooting and editing. “I made the proposal as specific as possible so there weren’t organizational or logistical challenges for CPW,” he says, adding, “I asked for one of their interns to help with the gear.”</p>
        <p>Ferguson says the artist residencies are a luxury, so his advice to anyone applying is to “think of something really important and worthwhile, and propose it specifically, so you can accomplish it in [the given] amount of time.” Shanberg says that while proposals shouldn’t be unrealistic, “I like ambition. Sometimes jurors have selected people, and we’ve asked them to temper their ambition.”</p>
        <p>His parting advice to applicants is not to be discouraged by rejection. “You should apply again” because the selection committee is constantly changing, he says. Photographer Gerard H. Gaskin, winner of the CDS/Honickman First Book Prize in Photography, applied for a CPW residency eight times before he won one in 2011. He is sure his having won a prestigious Light Work artist residency in 2010 helped to finally sway CPW jurors, but persistence does matter, he says.</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        An important part of working as an artist is establishing relationships with people who will give honest advice and critiques, make introductions, advocate for and support one’s work, and offer friendship and a sense of community. These people may be elder artists, peers, curators, gallerists, patrons or others who have an interest in art and its promotion. “The art world is more social than anything else,” says <a href="http://www.danielpshea.com/">Daniel Shea</a>, an artist based in New York. “It’s a world that politically exists around interpersonal relationships, for better or worse.”
        <p class="p1"><em>PDN</em> recently asked a dozen artists at varying stages of their careers about how they establish and maintain their relationships with peers and mentors. Here’s what they had to say. </p>
        <p class="p2"><strong>Work For Established Artists</strong> <br />
        Working for an established artist is a great way to form a connection, to create a natural mentor/mentee relationship and to learn first-hand how artists work. <a href="http://www.andersonstaley.com/">Keliy Anderson-Staley</a> says that early in her career, through an internship with Tanja Hollander and through working with Lori Nix, she was “able to see how they get their work out, how they promote it, what institutions they connect with, and how, and in what sequence (which can sometimes really matter).”</p>
        <p class="p3"><a href="http://eirikjohnson.com/">Eirik Johnson</a> says his experiences working for Michael Light and Richard Barnes, “helped deeply shape and inform my growth as a photographic artist.”</p>
        <p class="p3">Shea, who worked with Brian Ulrich as a young photographer, agrees. “It’s crazy how much you learn from just spending a full day with someone, just their little hacks and how they work on the road,” he says. Shea also believes that established artists enjoy working with younger artists. “I’m almost 30. There are really young people coming out of school that I like being around,” he says. “I like talking to them and I like helping them as much as I can.”</p>
        <p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Form and Participate Form and/or Participate in Peer Critiques Groups <br />
        </strong></span>After artists graduate from school, it can be difficult to replicate the interaction and feedback of group critiques. Many artists find like-minded peers and form crit groups outside of academic institutions. <a href="http://amystein.com/">Amy Stein</a>, for instance, is part of a group called Piece of Cake (POC), which meets twice a year. “Some of my closest, most nurturing relationships have resulted from being part of this group,” she says.</p>
        <p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Form Relationships With Curators and Gallery Staff at Your Level <br />
        </strong></span>It’s not realistic for most artists to expect to work with major curators, galleries or institutions early in their careers. That doesn’t mean artists should be discouraged. Working with peers, who are at the same level in their careers, establishes long-term relationships. Ariel Shanberg, the director of the <a href="http://www.cpw.org/">Center for Photography at Woodstock</a>, says he’s seen photographers contact gallerists and get handed off to a staff person—and just walk away feeling rejected. That’s a mistake, Shanberg says, because staff people move up the ladder. For instance, when Jonah Frank approached Yancey Richardson Gallery, he was handed off to an underling named Michael Foley, Shanberg recalls. Frank didn’t get a show there, but he made an impression on Michael Foley, and became the first artist whom Foley exhibited when he opened his own gallery in New York City.</p>
        <p class="p3">A curator told <a href="http://www.christopherchurchill.com/">Christopher Churchill</a> a similar story about Lee Friedlander and Elisabeth Sussman, who met when they were younger. Decades later, Friedlander had a show at the Whitney Museum of American Art, where Sussman was a curator. “You need to go meet with the curators who are your age, who are committed to it and are going to be moving through their careers as you’re moving through your career,” the curator advised Churchill. “If you can establish those relationships on a professional level that sort of peer interaction is crucial.”</p>
        <p class="p2"><strong>Establish Relationships With Patrons <br />
        </strong>Churchill says that a curator introduced him to a patron, a wealthy individual with an interest in photography who Churchill says has been supporting photographers and donating work to museums “forever.” He and Churchill established a friendship, and Churchill says that, “He’s really been a huge part of whatever success I’ve had in the art world.” Patrons often fly below the radar, but when a museum wants to acquire work, they rely on patron donors, not their operating budget, to fund those acquisitions. Churchill notes, “As an artist you have to develop that patron relationship, and that’s one of the most important things, because they will take you places that you can’t [otherwise] go.”</p>
        <p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Reach Out to Artists Because of Their Work, Not Their Connections <br />
        </strong></span>Understanding an artist’s work and why he or she might be interested in your work is important to establishing connections. “When you are genuinely interested in other people’s work and lives, and not just thinking about what you can gain from the other person, it shines through and people appreciate that and are willing to share their experiences with you,” advises <a href="http://www.justinereyes.com/">Justine Reyes</a>. Shea agrees: “Reaching out to those people in a sincere way and being specific about why you’re interested in their work and what the work means to you” makes an impression. When he established a friendship with Ulrich, Shea says, “I think he could tell that I was really hungry and eager to learn, and that I took what I did extremely seriously and I really respected what he did.”</p>
        <p class="p3">Stein suggests that artists looking for mentors should identify “individuals who you think might appreciate your work and learn more about them. Attend their openings and talks. Sign up to meet them at a portfolio review. Take the time to really understand their work or gallery program or projects. Then contact them.”</p>
        <p class="p2"><strong>Apply For Residencies<br />
        </strong>The focused, intense environment of artist residencies offer artists a chance to talk, work and form relationships with other artists that they can’t form in other settings. “That kind of environment fosters discussion and engagement that you can’t get in other situations,” says <a href="http://www.richardbarnes.net/">Richard Barnes</a>. “For me they have been really important in creating networks and establishing friendships that have far exceeded the time of the residency.”</p>
        <p class="p3">“A residency leads to an exhibition, which leads to a publication, and it is really the social network between these institutions that makes this progression possible,” says Anderson-Staley, whose Light Work residency in 2010 was “crucial to my career,” she says. “So many of my successes since can be connected back to that residency, and I still think of Hannah Frieser and Mary Goodwin, who I worked with there as mentors, and they are still helping me shape my career.”</p>
        <p class="p3">Shea met artist Kelly Kaczynski, with whom he’s become friends, during a residency. “If I had reached out to her [outside the residency] she would have been too busy to even meet up and get a coffee,” he argues. “But the residency environment, it’s small, it’s intense.” Shea formed a connection with Kaczynski and the two have been friends since. She recently recommended Shea to a museum curator and they are in early talks about an exhibition.</p>
        <p class="p2"><strong>Show Your Work to Everyone<br />
        </strong>As a young photographer, <a href="http://notifbutwhen.com/">Ulrich</a> worked for Sarah Hasted when she was director at the Howard Greenberg Gallery. He kept in touch and reached out to her as he was finishing his MFA. She told him it was “important to show [his work] to everyone”: curators, gallerists, photo editors and so on. The advice “alleviated a lot of pressure of those meetings,” Ulrich says, because “I didn’t have to approach meeting professionals with the expectation that there was a specific outcome.” This also empowered him to reach out to people he wouldn’t normally “just to meet, say hello and hear their thoughts about the work.” These early meetings formed professional relationships and led to a lot of opportunities, Ulrich says.</p>
        <p class="p3">Don’t be afraid to ask for meetings with curators, gallerists and peers, agrees <a href="http://sabinemirlesse.com/">Sabine Mirlesse</a>, a young photographer living and working in Paris. “The worst that could happen would be someone says no or doesn’t get back to you.”</p>
        <p class="p2"><strong>Share Work in Progress<br />
        </strong>Part of the reason that <a href="http://www.renaldi.com/">Richard Renaldi</a> was able to create a successful Kickstarter campaign to launch his book <em>Touching Strangers </em>(Aperture) last year was that he’d shared the photographs in the series while he was working on it. He began the work in 2007 and showed the images both physically and via social media networks as the series developed. “When it really came time to try and bring the work to life, there had already been a lot of people that were aware of the project, and I really think that that was one factor in its success.”</p>
        <p class="p2"><strong>Meet Face-to-Face<br />
        </strong>There is no doubt that social media and digital connections are an important part of building networks. But face-to-face meetings at openings, lectures, reviews and other events allow for connections that social media can’t replicate. “I am a photo professor, and I find that events like the annual meeting of the Society for Photographic Education are great places to meet people and catch up with past mentors,” says Anderson-Staley. “But face-to-face relationships need to be developed over time, and if years pass before you see them again, it will help to have been in touch via social media. It’s important to remember that networks are organic; they can’t be forced.”</p>
        <p class="p3"><a href="http://www.huffphoto.com/">Ben Huff</a>, a photographer who lives in Alaska and doesn’t have many opportunities to meet with other photographers in person, says that when he attended the Photolucida portfolio reviews in 2013, “I spoke to more people about photography that week than in the last eight years. It was incredible. It drove home again that need to get out and meet people face-to-face.” Huff also says that when he was invited by curator Larissa Leclair to show his work in China, he met and connected with curator Karen Irvine of the Museum of Contemporary Photography in Chicago. Irvine is writing the essay for Huff’s forthcoming book, and he says that wouldn’t have happened if they had not met and connected in person.</p>
        <p class="p2"><strong>But Don't Dismiss Social Media's Power<br />
        </strong>While in-person relationships offer connections and opportunities for conversation that online connections do not, the latter are undeniably important, and one often leads to the other. “I can think of a few occasions in which I have met someone in real life after a mutual affinity for each other’s work was developed on Instagram,” <a href="http://hollyandres.com/">Holly Andres</a> says. “In each one of these instances, our immediate reaction was to greet each other with a strong embrace. There is a powerful thing happening here and I hope it continues.”</p>
        <p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Connect With Artists Working </strong><strong>in Other Media<br />
        </strong></span>Forming connections with artists working in other media helps to expand one’s network and also provides opportunities to grow creatively. “The photo world is a small part of the art world,” Shea says. “To think about making art in different media or having friends and mentors that do, it challenges your own ideas about the work you’re making. ... I think it’s incredibly important.”</p>
        <p class="p3">Residencies that include artists working in different disciplines are good places to make these connections, Barnes says. “You meet people that you had no idea that you had anything in common with, and you realize, ‘Wow, I could collaborate with this person.’ And I have.”</p>
        <p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Stay in Touch With Teachers and Classmates <br />
        </strong></span>Mirlesse recalls that on her first day of graduate school, the director of her photography program sat the students down and told them to “take a good hard look around the room at each other, because these classmates would surely become our most important allies in future years.” Andres says that she’s kept in touch with “several professors” from undergraduate and graduate programs and now considers them “dear friends.” Andres isn’t sure how, but says she understood while she was a student “that my professors and peers would be part of my life-long artistic community, and I understood the importance of fostering these relationships.” For instance, one of her professors wrote a review of an exhibition of her series “Sparrow Lane” for <em>Art In America</em>, which “substantially changed the course of my career.”</p>
        <p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Form Authentic Relationships And Treat Them ‘Like Gold’<br />
        </strong></span>If you’re only interested in what someone can do for you, you’ve already missed the point. Authentic relationships are valuable relationships, says Stein.</p>
        <p class="p3">“The people who will truly appreciate your work and advocate for it may not be the movers and shakers you read about in [magazines] but may come from unexpected places. When you find these people, treat the relationships like gold and support their work and projects. If you are generous and supportive you will draw that energy toward you,” she says.</p>
        <p class="p3">“The people who I most think of as mentors, I also think of as friends,” says Anderson-Staley. “What I’ve done to make the relationships work is simply to be a good friend in return.”</p>
        <p class="p3">“Get invested in other people’s lives/art that you admire and become a cheerleader for it,” Reyes says. “Don’t go into a relationship thinking only of what you can take from it but also what you bring to the table.”</p>
        <p class="p3">Barnes says his relationships with Eirik Johnson and two other photographers he’s worked with, Will Mebane and Nigel Poor, progressed from assistantships into friendships as they established their careers because they were serious about their work and engaged. “It’s a reciprocal relationship,” Barnes says. “I get a lot out of them, and I still do as friends.”</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <p class="p1">For 20 years, photojournalist <a href="http://www.menzelphoto.com/">Peter Menzel</a> and his wife, former TV news producer Faith D’Aluisio, have built a brand around their interest in personal consumption and the environment. For their 1994 book, <em>Material World: A Global Family Portrait </em>(Sierra Club Books), they traveled the world to photograph families who posed with all their possessions spread out before them. It was a bestseller that led to subsequent self-published projects, including <em>Hungry Planet: What the World Eats </em>(2005) and <em>What I Eat: Around the World in 80 Diets </em>(2010).</p>
        <p class="p1">Last fall, while in Oslo to open a “Hungry Planet” exhibition, they received a proposal by e-mail for a project about residential waste. They’ve heard that idea before, and their response is always the same: Bring us a sponsor. Menzel and D’Aluisio spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce and publish their projects, so they have to sell books. Waste is not a bestseller. “People like to have books on their coffee tables about things that are fairly pleasant to think about,” Menzel says.</p>
        <p class="p1">But the pitch was from a PR firm interested in hiring Menzel and D’Aluisio to shoot a public service project about residential waste for Glad Products Company, the maker of food storage containers and trash bags. “They asked us to come up with an idea to show physically what [households in America] waste and throw away,” Menzel says.</p>
        <p class="p1">Glad undertook the project “in support of the Environmental Protection Agency’s goal to divert 80 percent of waste from landfills by 2020,” May Lam, associate marketing manager for Glad, said in an e-mail. The company wanted to hire Menzel and D’Aluisio for their signature style. “We were captivated and inspired by their <em>Hungry Planet </em>work,” Lam said.</p>
        <p class="p1">Menzel and D’Aluisio were wary at first. “We have done practically zero advertising in my 44 years as a photographer,” Menzel says. They want to protect the editorial integrity of their brand, and they don’t want to help corporations engage in greenwashing.</p>
        <p class="p1">But they are also worried about the future of the planet, and believe that everyone— consumers and manufacturers—have to waste less and recycle more. They figured the Glad project could allow them “to start a dialogue and raise awareness,” Menzel says.</p>
        <p class="p1">First, however, they had to figure out if the project was even feasible. The idea was simple: Photograph families with all the recyclables and household waste they generate in a week. “But what do you do with that stuff? Put a tarp on their living room floor and dump it out in two piles?” Menzel asks rhetorically. “You couldn’t tell what was in the piles.”</p>
        <p class="p1">He and D’Aluisio experimented, first with their own trash and then by recruiting another family in their neighborhood in Napa, Calif., to test their ideas. They separated the recyclables into categories and first tried hanging each item by plastic threads “like a huge mobile.” But “that would have been hugely expensive and time consuming,” Menzel says.</p>
        <p class="p1">They then tried building a frame with wood, covering it with canvas and using hot glue or wire to attach each item. That didn’t work, either.</p>
        <p class="p1">Finally they hit upon the idea of mounting everything on wheeled clothing racks. They searched the internet and found just the right style of rack. “Faith figured out a way to sew bird netting on the rack, and we put a piece of industrial Velcro on the back of every item.” The Velcro enabled them to attach the recyclables to the bird netting on the racks “and move them around like refrigerator magnets to make them esthetic.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Convinced that they could pull the project off, they agreed to do it—but only on their terms.</p>
        <p class="p1">“We told [Glad and its PR firm], ‘You have to treat this as an editorial project, treat it like a grant, and let us design it. You can’t tell us what to do or how to do it,’” Menzel says. Negotiations took several months, but Glad executives finally agreed to those terms.</p>
        <p class="p1">“We fully believed in the caliber of their work and trusted that we would best enable this project by giving them full artistic freedom,” Lam says.</p>
        <p class="p1">With an undisclosed budget that was commensurate with “a public service project, rather than a commercial or advertising shoot,” Menzel and D’Aluisio began looking for eight ethnically and geographically diverse families. Menzel contacted friends, photographer colleagues and journalists. He explained the project and said they were looking for “typical families with two kids between the ages of 7 and 18, that were not poor and not rich.”</p>
        <p class="p1">To his surprise, he didn’t get a single response. So he turned to location scouts in San Francisco, Phoenix, Atlanta and New York for help. Menzel said he wanted “real people. No models, no actors,” which is his rule for all of his projects.</p>
        <p class="p1">The location scouts also had trouble finding families. Menzel says, “It’s one thing to show what you eat in a week. But getting people to show what they throw away? It’s a little bit personal. It’s tremendously revealing.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Compensation, which included a modest fee and Glad products, was not an enticement, but the location scouts had copies of <em>Hungry Planet </em>to show. They posted flyers in schools and libraries and hit the streets, and finally found willing families. Menzel and D’Aluisio screened them with phone interviews. “I talked to them in a down-to-earth way about their [recycling] habits,” Menzel says. “You don’t want people that are super conscientious, you want people who handle it in an everyday kind of way.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Menzel provided the selected families with collection bins and instructions about separating their waste. He collected the bins after a week, and took them to a hotel suite where D’Aluisio and an assistant washed the recyclables by hand in the bathtub. Then they attached the items to the clothes racks for the portraits back at the families’ homes.</p>
        <p class="p1">“When we tallied up the hours we spent building and then executing the project, we earned just slightly above San Francisco minimum wage [$10.74 per hour], but we do tend to overextend ourselves in the interest of doing a good job,” Menzel says.</p>
        <p class="p1">The resulting images present a snapshot of the waste that the different families generate in a week, and of how household waste management practices vary from family to family and city to city. To supplement the images with information, and to encourage viewers to think about how to reduce their own waste, D’Aluisio researched the economics of recycling and environmental impacts of landfill waste.</p>
        <p class="p1">Glad unveiled the photos at a press conference, held by New York City officials on April 10, to announce the expansion of compost collection in some neighborhoods of Brooklyn and Queens. That composting initiative is part of the city’s effort to reduce landfill waste. Glad donated “a bunch of new trash bags that are supposed to be tougher” to the project, Menzel says.</p>
        <p class="p1">The pictures were also displayed in New York’s Union Square on Earth Day, April 22. Various media outlets have also posted the pictures online, including Smithsonian.com, Parade.com and HuffingtonPost.com.</p>
        <p class="p1">“It would be interesting to look at household waste in South America, Africa and Asia, and compare it to affluent Western countries,” Menzel says in retrospect. But it would be complicated. “We’re not going to take clothes racks around the world, hanging up people’s stuff in a village in Africa. It’s just not going to look the same.”</p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="p1">And, Menzel says, it won’t happen without a sponsor.</p>

        What if we said you could take a workshop with <a href="http://www.toddhido.com/">Todd Hido</a>, <a href="http://www.maryellenmark.com/exhibitions/exhibitions.html">Mary Ellen Mark</a>, <a href="http://www.dawoudbey.net/">Dawoud Bey</a> or <a href="http://www.rinkokawauchi.com/main/index.html">Rinko Kawauchi</a> for just $30? Sounds pretty good, right? This summer Aperture is launching <em>The Photography Workshop Series</em>, which aims to present a close approximation of the workshop experience in a handy, portable, nicely designed and inexpensive softcover book.
        <p class="p1">The first two books in the series are <em>Larry Fink on Composition and Improvisation</em>, and <em>Alex Webb and rebecca norris Webb on Street Photography and the Poetic Image</em>. (Books from the photographers mentioned above will follow in the future.) Fink’s book includes chapters such as “Breaking the Frame,” “Looking for Yourself Within the Subject” and “Emotional Composition,” which rely on his images to illustrate concepts. In their book, Alex Webb and Rebecca Norris Webb present stories behind their images to illustrate ideas about street photography, which Alex Webb defines as not literally photographing in the streets, but as “a photographer’s particular stance or attitude towards the world: a kind of open- ended exploration with an emphasis on discovery.” Their book also discusses a wide range of images from other photographers and artists, from Eugene Meatyard to Eugene Richards and Goya.</p>
        <p class="p1">The books investigate topics succinctly; the authors often take less than a few paragraphs to explain a point or concept, and rarely does a particular lesson run longer than<span class="s1"> </span>a page or two. These highly readable and digestible books will get any photographer thinking and seeing in new ways.</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <p class="p1">After the release of her most recent book, Spanish photographer <a href="http://www.lademiddel.com/">Cristina De Middel</a> thinks it’s highly unlikely that she’ll be allowed back into China. The last time she was there, in 2013, her visa was restricted, and immigration officials made her pay double for it. And when her publishers, RM Verlag and The Archive of Modern Conflict, tried to print her book in China, it didn’t make it past the censors. They ended up printing it in Spain instead.</p>
        <p class="p1">The reason is that De Middel’s new book, <em>Party </em>(2014), is based on <em>Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung</em>, the famed “Little Red Book” of the Chinese cultural revolution, which is thought to be one of the most-printed books in history. To create <em>Party</em>, De Middel went through the book and whited out large portions of Mao’s texts to create a new series of sentences and fragments. She then matched her photographs from China with the texts she created, forming a playful narrative that questions the connections (or lack thereof ) between China’s modern culture and the communist identity it projects globally.</p>
        <p class="p1">The idea for the book, which sold out quickly this spring, grew partly out of De Middel’s need to find a structure to present the images she made during her travels in China. She first journeyed there in 2011 during a time of personal upheaval. She had spent several years as a staff photographer at regional Spanish newspapers but became disillusioned with the media. “I found that my life lost its meaning, because I stopped believing you could change the world with your photographs,” she recalls. This was before her first, self-published book, <em>The Afronauts </em>(2012), a reimagining of the history of the Zambian space program, became a sensation that catapulted her to international renown in photography circles.</p>
        <p class="p1">Her trip to China was an escape: No one knew her and she didn’t speak the language. And, perhaps most importantly, she was able to take pictures not because she had to, but because she wanted to and enjoyed doing it. She was able to “start from zero,” she says, adding that photographing was “actually the best therapy I could have. I was okay again in two weeks.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Before she traveled to China, De Middel had perceived a disconnection between China’s communist identity and the reality of the society, and that idea was confirmed by her trip. “Once you are there it’s quite evident that people are very different from what they say they are, in a way,” she says. De Middel looked for pictures that explored this idea and came back with 3,000 images. Some of them were staged, but most were observed moments.</p>
        <p class="p1">Her idea to use the “Little Red Book” with a rearranged text arose partly because English is her second language, and she often has to reread texts several times because she will “get a weird meaning” from a first read. This happened with Mao’s text, which she read in English. On the first page, when she read “The Communist Party,” she keyed in on the double meaning of the word “party.” The thought of a communist celebration jibed with her impression of China. “The idea of ‘Communist Party’ describes what China is, if you just change the meaning of the word ‘Party’ to a proper party,” she explains.</p>
        <p class="p1">She began carrying a copy of the book around with her, experimenting with the text. One of the earliest lines in De Middel’s book reads, “If there is to be revolution, there must be a party.” Facing the text is a picture of a young woman in a floral-print blouse dancing in a bar. While there is a playful tone to the opening pages, there are combinations of text and photographs that are serious or abstract throughout the book. An image of a group of people in a smoke-filled landscape sits opposite a text that reads, “We ought to face the world and brave the storm.”</p>
        <p class="p1">De Middel wanted the tone of the book to fluctuate and to challenge and surprise the viewer. She points out that in movies, music and lighting might signal to viewers that they are watching a drama or comedy, and similar “codes” can be employed in books and photography series. “I like when there’s surprise and I like when people don’t know how to react,” she says. “You are forced to reposition yourself, because normally the messages that you have are very straightforward.”</p>
        <p class="p1">The possibility for multiple interpretations reflects her personal experiences, in which “sometimes I like things and, two minutes later, they’re terrible and then I laugh about them.” Reality is complex, in other words. “I try to convey that in the works I do,” she says. “I want to present reality as rich as it is, and I’m sort of helping you to approach reality from different angles. And you have to decide in the end what you think and what your opinion is, because it’s all about you deciding.”</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        Securing representation by a gallery is often seen as the brass ring of a fine-art photography career, a validation of an artist’s value. But photographers often don’t know what to expect from a gallery, or what galleries expect in return. Who pays for what? Who manages the inventory? Can the photographer expect an exhibition soon? <em>PDN</em> surveyed photographers and galleries about the ins and outs of gallery representations, asking what points of confusion should be discussed, and how photographers can make the most of their relationship with a gallery. Here’s what we learned.
        <p class="p2"><strong>Contracts &amp; Handshakes</strong></p>
        <p class="p1">The first bone of contention is contracts. Some people think they are a good idea, but we couldn’t find any photographers or gallerists who had signed one.</p>
        <p class="p1">“A written document is essential,” insists noted photography consultant Mary Virginia Swanson, author of <em>The Business of Photography</em>. “Many galleries don’t use one, so artists need to sit down with a dealer if they don’t provide a contract to discuss what the expectations are.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Swanson suggests artists then write a memorandum of understanding, stating what they understand about the arrangement in terms of commissions, insurance, production costs and exclusivity (that is, if the gallery will be the photographer’s sole representative).</p>
        <p class="p2"><strong>Commissions &amp; Costs</strong></p>
        <p class="p1">In general, artists and galleries work on a 50-50 split for print sales.</p>
        <p class="p1">“Some photographers seem to think that 50 percent [commission] is too high,” says Cig Harvey, a photographer in Rockport, Maine, who is represented by galleries in Maine, Boston, New York, Colorado and San Francisco. “But with the cost of overhead and art fairs, a gallery would have to sell a lot of photographs to make that. Artists don’t always see what galleries have to pay.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Artists generally pay production costs, while galleries pay promotional costs. Whoever is doing the shipping pays the shipping costs.</p>
        <p class="p1">Charles Guice, a gallerist who works in Katonah, N.Y. and San Francisco, says he was willing to help artist Erika Diettes to pay the production costs of her “Sudarios” series because printing her images on large sheets of silk was a major expense.</p>
        <p class="p1">“With any sales, the cost of producing a panel is returned to [Diettes] before the 50-50 split,” explains Guice. “With other artists, I have paid the production costs or split it with the artist.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Artists sometimes fear that galleries will assert ownership over photographs they paid to produce. Galleries say that artists should be willing to reimburse a gallery for the cost of mounting and framing a photograph, should the photographer and gallery part ways.</p>
        <p class="p1">“It does get confusing,” says Maja Orsic, director of the Robert Klein Gallery in Boston. “We may own the mount, and the artist owns the print, but they can’t be separated.” Orsic says Robert Klein has occasionally chosen to purchase a photograph in such circumstances.</p>
        <p class="p1">One of the most common complaints about art galleries is about slow payment—or no payment.</p>
        <p class="p1">“There are an awful lot of galleries that don’t pay their artists,” says Alex Novak, a private dealer in Chalfont, Pa., and publisher of the E-Photo Newsletter. “It’s not unusual for galleries to delay payment or not pay at all. On the other hand, many, many galleries make a practice of paying on time.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Novak advises artists to do due diligence before they enter into a gallery relationship.</p>
        <p class="p1">“The first thing an artist or photographer should do is check out how a gallery works and pays. You go to their website and you contact their artists. Ask them, ‘Do they really represent you? Do they pay photographers on time? What kind of people are they?’”</p>
        <p class="p2"><strong>Types of Representation</strong></p>
        <p class="p1">Emerging photographers are sometimes unaware of the different kinds of gallery representation. These can include the gallery taking a few prints to sell on consignment, including a few of the artist’s prints in a group show, or an invitation to join the gallery’s stable of artists. Galleries make a distinction between “artists in inventory” and “artists represented.”</p>
        <p class="p1">“I always have work in my flat files by artists I don’t represent,” says New York art dealer Daniel Cooney of Daniel Cooney Fine Art. “Someone might consign ten prints. There is definitely work in my inventory that is not on the wall.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Orsic says Robert Klein uses consignment agreements when it takes prints from an artist. The gallery will take work for one year, and then check on how well the relationship has worked and whether “there are no sales, or if there are a certain number of sales,” she explains.</p>
        <p class="p1">Not all artists in any given gallery are represented in the same way. For example, an artist with international stature, such as Brazilian photographer Sebasti&atilde;o Salgado, does not provide prints for inventory. Representing Salgado simply means the artist will ship a print to a gallery if it has a buyer. “Some artists are directly represented,” adds Orsic. “Some we work with through other galleries.”</p>
        <p class="p1">
        She cites photographers Paulette Tavormina and Gregory Vershbow as artists included in Robert Klein’s primary gallery. “With Paulette and Gregory, we were the first gallery to take them on, so we helped establish their price structure,” Orsic says. “For Paulette, we consign her work out to galleries around the world.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Art dealer Daniel Miller of Duncan Miller Gallery in Santa Monica, Calif., has created a category he calls “representation lite.” The gallery “sponsors” members of the Verge Photographers group, which includes seven emerging photographers: Claire Mallett, Jamie Johnson, Marjorie “Verge is on our website, but we don’t represent them,” says Miller. “We also sponsored a booth at Photo LA. It’s a way of supporting photographers before they are really selling stuff.” Duncan Miller Gallery only takes a 30 percent commission on the sale of work by Verge Photographers.</p>
        <p class="p2"><strong>What “Exclusivity” &amp; Commitment Mean</strong></p>
        <p class="p1">Most photographers with gallery representation have their work sold by several geographically dispersed galleries, but even dealers disagree over the issue of exclusivity.</p>
        <p class="p1">“We all want artists to make a good living and it’s virtually impossible to do that with one gallery,” says gallerist Miller.</p>
        <p class="p1">But Novak says, “If an artist is in a lot of galleries, I don’t want to represent them. Over time, a photographer will sell less with a dozen galleries competing. They bid down the price.” He cites the example of one well-known photographer who made millions of dollars in the 1990s, but “over-exposure killed him.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Photographer Dave Anderson of Little Rock, Ark., is represented by galleries in Atlanta, New York, San Francisco and Newport Beach, Calif., but he cautions that even some well-established galleries might not be worth an artist’s time.</p>
        <p class="p1">“There was one gallery where I was very impressed by the dealer’s curatorial eye,” Anderson recalls. “He had a lot of interesting photographs and some major exhibitions. But then I came to the realization that I didn’t see a second show for any of the artists.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Harvey agrees that photographers should “want someone you can grow with, make a life with. It would be awful to be dumped after one show. When you’re just starting out, you’re so desperate to have representation, but you have to hold out for the right one. You don’t want a one-night stand.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Cooney, the New York dealer, works with a lot of emerging artists and says that one of the greatest misconceptions young artists have about galleries is that “their life is going to be happier, all their problems are solved because they have a show.</p>
        <p class="p1">“Lack of a long-term vision with some artists can cause problems,” he adds. “I’ve had a couple of instances when a first show didn’t sell and the artist said, ‘I don’t want to show with you anymore.’ It can definitely happen on both ends. But I feel more determined if nothing sells.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Photographer Keith Carter of Beaumont, Texas, is represented by nine galleries around the country. He says that keeping track of so many relationships can be challenging without help.</p>
        <p class="p1">“Many photographers would benefit from having a business manager,” advises Carter. “Mine has been my wife, Pat. She’s careful, thoughtful, patient and firm. I, as the artist, am a wuss. I want everybody to like me. Many artists are just not beautifully organized.”</p>
        <p class="p2"><strong>Managing Inventory</strong></p>
        <p class="p1">Keeping track of inventory can be a headache for both artists and galleries.</p>
        <p class="p1">“One difficulty we come up against is artists relying on the gallery to organize their prints,” says Orsic, including keeping count of how many prints are in an edition, how many artist’s proofs they have and how many images they’ve sold. “But [artists] don’t keep records of what we have. We keep records of what we have, what leaves the gallery for sale or for approval or to museums. We try to keep a paper trail of everything.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Cooney, the art dealer, cautions that, “It’s a mom-and-pop business. Not a lot is really written down. A lot of people leave things. Most of what I have in the flat files are not signed.” He adds, “I have stuff from artists I have parted ways with. In one situation, an artist left unsigned prints for five years. I threw them away. Then they sued me for the retail value and I had to pay them something.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Artist Anderson, too, had an incident when he left a gallery and<br />
        the gallery could not find a print he had consigned for sale. “They were honorable and paid me for what was missing,” he says. “The only answer to [the problem] is to have an industry-wide, accepted system of print tracking, and that seems highly unlikely.”</p>
        <p class="p1">The Association of International Photography Art Dealers has a code of ethics that simply states: “Members agree to honor all contracts, invoices and consignment agreements.” There are, however, no established standards or guidelines for artist-gallery relations.</p>
        <p class="p1">“Early in my career,” Carter says, “a dealer told me, ‘Keith, the way these things work is however you can get them to work.’”</p>
        <p class="p1">Ultimately, the photography art scene is a small world where personal and professional relationships are often inseparable. That being the case, it behooves artists and gallerists alike to be sensitive to one another’s needs.</p>
        <p class="p1">“You’re only as good as your reputation,” says Carter. “Word gets around pretty quickly. You want to be honorable. If you want to traverse the gallery world, the first order of business is to do good, solid work and try to keep evolving. Look for a gallery you can have a relationship with and where someone cares about your work. A little of that goes a long way.”</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        More than two million people have fled the civil war in Syria, resulting in the biggest refugee crisis in recent memory. To help raise the morale of some of those refugees, <a href="http://www.ninaberman.com/">Nina Berman</a> and three other <a href="http://noorimages.com/">NOOR</a> photographers recently shot images of daily life in the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan and exhibited them on the camp’s concrete security walls.
        <p class="p1">“The idea was to show that people are surviving. Some are making families. They have shops. They have schools,” says Berman, explaining that it is easy for the refugees to despair, because their prospects of settlement in other countries are dim and the camp is turning into a permanent settlement.</p>
        <p class="p1">“They should never forget that they are survivors and their journey was a heroic one,” she says. She also wants newcomers who see the images on their way into the camp to realize: “We can make a new life here.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Berman conceived the project after an e-mail exchange with a former <em>Newsweek </em>writer, Greg Beals, who was working for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) at the Zaatari camp. She mentioned having seen an aerial photograph that showed the camp’s seemingly endless rows of tents and structures. Berman says that Beals replied, “You should see the security walls. They’re really grim.” He then sent pictures of the concrete walls topped with barbed wire. “I thought, man, that’s an exhibition space, really,” says Berman, who is always looking beyond media outlets for new ways to show and distribute documentary photography. She wondered if the UNHCR might want to “make [the camp] not appear so prison-like,” and began thinking about what kinds of images might appeal to the refugees. Images of daily life in the camp seemed obvious, though she realized those would have to walk a fine line between an unvarnished, grim reality and a sugar-coated view.</p>
        <p class="p1">Another idea she had was to set up a portable studio to make portraits that the refugees could keep or send back to relatives in Syria. Considering that they had left behind all their belongings, including family pictures, having a family portrait might be something they valued, Berman thought. </p>
        <p class="p1">She posted a message to other NOOR photographers outlining her idea and asking if anyone was interested in working with her on the project. <a href="http://www.andreabruce.com/">Andrea Bruce</a> and <a href="http://noorimages.com/photographer/greene/">Stanley Greene</a>, who have both worked in Syria since the start of the civil war, signed up. Berman also encouraged <a href="http://noorimages.com/photographer/fazzina/">Alixandra Fazzina</a>, who won the UNHCR’s top award in 2010 for work on behalf of refugees, to join.</p>
        <p class="p1">She then sent a proposal to UNHCR explaining that the team wanted to “make pictures of daily life that will allow people to reflect on the situation and hopefully bring attention to the Syrian refugee crisis.”</p>
        <p class="p1">The proposal included a budget to cover the costs of the photo booth portraits, exhibition prints, travel and a “minimal fee” for the photographers. (Berman did not want the budget disclosed.)</p>
        <p class="p1">The UNHCR asked whether she and the other photographers had experience working in refugee camps. “All of us have,” Berman replied. So the UNHCR approved the project and funded it in conjunction with the Japanese Emergency NGO (JEN), a consortium of Japanese NGOs working in the Zaatari camp.</p>
        <p class="p1">The photographers flew to Jordan for six days of shooting at the end of December last year. Bruce spent most of the time shooting portraits of refugees in the photo booth. At first they were hesitant, she says, but then hundreds of people started lining up and she could hardly keep up with the demand.</p>
        <p class="p1">“They need housing and food. They need so much. But the photo booth gave them something they wanted desperately: normalcy,” Bruce explained in an e-mail. “To offer each person a portrait of themselves, with a simple black backdrop, sometimes holding one of their favorite possessions, sometimes with a best friend or loved one, was a joy for all of us.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Berman, Greene and Fazzina spent most of their time photographing daily life around the camp. Greene focused on former Free Syria fighters who had been wounded. Fazzina was interested in the idea of starting anew and tried to photograph weddings and births, Berman says.</p>
        <p class="p1">The photographers were careful to explain how the pictures would be used and to ask all the subjects for permission to display them on the walls. The team had to be cautious about showing faces of any subjects, for fear of endangering family back in Syria.</p>
        <p class="p1">The photographers were also sensitive to how the refugees might react to the images posted on the walls. “Our helpers and Jordanian NGO staff members with friends in the camp [were] going to be asked to answer for our work” after the photographers left, Berman explains. “We didn’t want to damage them.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Once the photographers left Jordan, Berman asked the other three to provide her with 20 to 40 images for the wall exhibit. She ended up organizing the photos by theme and color palette.</p>
        <p class="p1">In March, she returned to Jordan to mount the images, accompanied by Photoville co-founder and creative director Sam Barzilay. “He has experience conceiving outdoor projects. He was a huge help,” Berman says.</p>
        <p class="p1">They worked with a printer in Amman to make 3-foot-wide prints. At first, Berman planned to have the images printed on vinyl and secure them on the walls with grommets. “But in the camp, anything that’s not fastened down is stolen. If a grommet comes loose, [the vinyl] becomes someone’s roof because it’s waterproof.”</p>
        <p class="p1">They ended up printing the images on paper instead and pasting them to the walls. Jordanian officials who stood by balked at several of the images. One of Fazzina’s images, for instance, showed a screaming newborn being measured in a camp hospital. “I’m sure Alixandra saw it as a new life, fighting to survive,” Berman says, but Jordanian officials “freaked out” and said it had to come down.</p>
        <p class="p1">Another image by Berman showed refugees in a bread line. “The Jordanians said it makes it look like the people are poor,” Berman says. “We said, ‘Well, they are poor.’”</p>
        <p class="p1">That image stayed, as did another showing two men building a washroom with bricks. Jordanian authorities objected because refugees aren’t allowed to build with bricks (the camp is officially temporary), so the picture appeared to show illegal activity. Berman saved it by suggesting they write a caption in Arabic that appeared under the photo, explaining what the men were building.</p>
        <p class="p1"></p>
        <p class="p1">Berman says she’d like to bring the project to one of the Photoville public exhibitions in the United States this fall. And with the NOOR team, she’s looking for other venues. “Anything that puts Syria on people’s minds is a good thing,” especially as the media loses interest in the war and refugees slip into a permanent limbo.</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        Life experiences, and our memory of them, help form the foundation of our identity. Our recollections influence how we think, who we are and who we will become. When people suffering from Alzheimer’s, a progressive degenerative brain disease, gradually lose their memories, the foundation of their lives and identities begins to crumble.
        <p class="p1">Photographer <a href="http://www.christophernunn.co.uk/">Christopher Nunn</a> experienced this with his own grandmother, who died of Alzheimer’s. When he found out in 2009 that a friend of his, the painter David Blackburn, was suffering from the disease, he began to “record [Blackburn’s] day-to-day life” with his camera, unsure what, if anything, he would do with the images he created. The photographs became “Falling Into the Day,” Nunn’s ongoing project depicting Blackburn’s struggle with Alzheimer’s.</p>
        <p class="p1">What compelled Nunn to create a project about his friend’s experience was the fact that Blackburn lived alone, had no family present and was “dealing with this on his own,” Nunn says. Other projects he’d seen depicted Alzheimer’s through the toll it takes on the sufferer and his or her immediate family and close friends. When Nunn photographed Blackburn “it was always just me and him.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Nunn focused on “really subtle details, because you can’t see [Alzheimer’s], there’s nothing obvious. It’s very difficult to photograph.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Nunn’s color images include portraits of Blackburn in his home and studio, and in the care facility where he currently lives, along with interior images of Blackburn’s home that call attention to the intricacies of his life and character. One image depicts Blackburn’s bed and a photograph of him and his mother on the nightstand. Another photograph shows Blackburn posing for a portrait on a snowy road. Other images show objects like boxes of slides, diaries or stacks of books piled high in a hallway.</p>
        <p class="p1">The photographs are, for Nunn, “about my friendship with him as much as the dementia, because nobody else could have made this work about him.” Nunn and Blackburn met in 2003 when the latter came into a hardware store where Nunn worked after graduating from university. They struck up a conver- sation, and Blackburn returned later, gave Nunn some of his books and told him to keep in touch. The friendship grew from there, despite their age difference, and Nunn visited Blackburn regularly in the intervening years, photographing him occasionally, but “not very seriously,” he says.</p>
        <p class="p1">Nunn had never met anyone else Blackburn knew until, in 2009, a longtime friend of Black- burn’s reached out to tell Nunn something he’d already begun to suspect: that Blackburn was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s. “That’s when I thought, ‘I’m just going to start photographing him and see what happens,’” Nunn recalls.</p>
        <p class="p1">About a year later Nunn showed some of the images to friends and at portfolio reviews, and people responded positively. He’s con- tinued to work on the project since then, as Blackburn’s condition has worsened to the point where he can no longer live at home alone, and no longer recognizes Nunn.</p>
        <p class="p1">The ethics of photographing someone suffering from dementia weighed heavily on Nunn’s mind, he says, especially when “it came to a point when he probably didn’t know who I was.” Their long friendship and the fact that “he was always happy for me to photograph him” before his illness convinced Nunn that it was acceptable to continue. The photographer is part of a group of intimates who continue to look after Blackburn, he says.</p>
        <p class="p1">Nunn says there were “horrible things” associated with Alzheimer’s that he saw while photographing Blackburn, yet chose not to show. Instead he looked for signs of Blackburn’s “character that he always seemed to retain even though he was getting ill. He’s this very gentle guy, always dressed in a shirt and tie ... that was more interesting to me.” Nunn was also interested in Blackburn’s “creative, artistic mind, things that I saw that were related to the way he thought.” An image Nunn made of bits of soap arranged in color order on a bathroom sink alluded to the painter’s practice of arranging things by color around his house. “[It’s] something that he used to do when he was well, but it’s one of the things that he still did when he was getting worse with his Alzheimer’s,” Nunn explains.</p>
        <p class="p1">The series has appeared on the CNN Photos <a href="http://cnnphotos.blogs.cnn.com/">website</a> and on other photography and art blogs, and Nunn has showed a few of the prints in group shows. He’s nearing the end of the project, and wants to work with an Alzheimer’s charity to release a book. Nunn says he “never really knew what people would get” from the project, but after the work appeared on CNN Photos he heard from people around the world who had experience with Alzheimer’s. “They notice things in these photographs from their own experiences with Alzheimer’s, and that’s the most important thing for me: that people who know this disease, that they can see it in the work.”</p>

        <em>The assignments, exercises, and advice shared by photographers, educators, editors, curators and others in </em>The Photographer’s Playbook<em>, out this month from Aperture, are as fascinating, stimulating, fun and various as the medium of photography itself. Edited by photographers Jason Fulford and Gregory Halpern, the book includes entries written by 307 people from all walks of photography. “We were curious about other photographers’ experiences of learning, and so we started asking around, and that’s how this book was born,” write the editors in their introduction. Photographers at all stages of their careers will find challenges to enjoy and think about in the book. Below are some of our favorites.</em>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><a href="http://shelby-lee-adams.blogspot.com/">Shelby Lee Adams</a>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>Find Your Reflection<br />
        </strong></span>If you’re having difficulty finding a natural or intuitive expression in a portrait session or having trouble identifying with the person you’re photographing, look into their eyes carefully and see if you can find your own reflection there. Discover yourself looking at you. Then, ask your subject to look into your camera lens and find their own reflection, and be prepared to make the portrait. In that singular moment, people are less focused on projecting an image of themselves for the camera and are more looking to find themselves.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><a href="http://www.richardbarnes.net/">Richard Barnes</a>: C</strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>ollaborating Across Disciplines <br />
        </strong></span>In my class “Subverting the Document,” we examine the nineteenth century not only through technology, in which the invention of photography was a major development, but also through the social sciences (anthropology, psychology, evolution, criminology and eugenics). We discuss the interaction between photographers, criminologists, social scientists, etc.</p>
        <p class="p2">The nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries are full of these collaborations. Charles Darwin, for example, collaborated with the photographer Oscar Rejlander on his book <em>The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</em>, and Nadar’s brother, Adrien [Tournachon], also a photographer, worked with the noted neurologist Guillaume Duchenne de Boulogne on his book <em>The Mechanism of Human Physiognomy</em>. Photography played a crucial role, not only in documenting new ideas in the social sciences of the nineteenth century, but also in developing and furthering the disciplines mentioned above.</p>
        <p class="p2">Your assignment is to find a collaborator—for example, a forensic scientist, or someone else working in a field that is foreign to you—and offer your services as a photographer.</p>
        <p class="p2">Write about your interaction even if it leads to rejection. When you do find someone to work with, create a portfolio of images based on the experience.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><a href="http://www.ericwilliamcarroll.com/">Eric William Carroll</a>: C</strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>hicken<br />
        </strong></span>Choose a person, preferably a stranger, to make a portrait of. After securing their permission, begin photographing them. Ask them to try a few poses, move the camera around, suggest a different location. Never stop photographing. If/when the subject becomes visibly irritated, snap the shutter at an even faster pace. Fake technical problems to prolong the session for as long as possible. The only rule is that you cannot choose to stop photographing—the subject must [tell] you that they no longer wish to have any more pictures made. Bonus points for those who get a model release signed post-shoot. <em>(Inspired by Jim Goldberg)</em></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Reid Callanan: C</strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>ameras Don’t Take Pictures<br />
        </strong></span>Of all the workshops that I’ve taught, my favorite is called “Cameras Don’t Take Pictures.” In this class, we examine where our images come from, because they certainly don’t come from our cameras. What we find out very quickly is that our photographs come from our imaginations, our curiosity, our questions, our hearts, our memories, our dreams and from all of the different things that make us human.</p>
        <p class="p2">A few assignments I give to help speed this process along are:<br />
        1. The camera is blind and it doesn’t understand mood. Make an image with your camera of a mood.<br />
        2. Make a portrait of something you love. Now make a portrait of something you hate.<br />
        3. Recreate a dream in a sequence of ten images.<br />
        4. Create an image you don’t understand and create an image that asks a question.<br />
        5. Make images where the subject is on the edge of the frame and then make images where the subject is outside the frame.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><a href="http://www.toddhido.com/">Todd Hido</a>: Ex</strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>pose Yourself<br />
        </strong></span>Expose yourself to a different environment. Go on an overnight trip, preferably two nights, to somewhere that you don’t normally go. Obviously the whole goal is to photograph there, and you should take as many pictures as you can. Notice how much more you’re responding to, and the details you’re seeing that you walk by every day in your normal daily life. Notice that it’s like somebody opened your eyes. This is the most tried-and-true method of finding things that you like to photograph.</p>
        <p class="p2">It’s worked for photographers for years and years. My favorite and most effective thing to do in my work process is to get an airplane ticket to a city that I’ve not yet visited, rent a car and drive around for two days to shoot—with no hotel reservation, no plan to meet anybody, nothing set in stone. Everything is left to spontaneity, except for my return ticket home.</p>
        <p class="p3"><span class="s3"><strong><a href="http://www.lademiddel.com/">Cristina De Middel</a>: </strong></span><strong>The De Middel Three-Step Guide to Photographic Storytelling<br />
        </strong>1. Watch your favorite movie again. Without leaving your city, try to tell the same story in 20 images. Sci-fi and old classics are welcome, whereas romantic comedies are not really recommended (even if it is your secret favorite).</p>
        <p class="p2">2. Read your favorite book again. Without leaving your neighborhood, try to tell the same story in 20 images. You can try to work with what you remember of the book if you don’t want to read it again (but would it really be your favorite book then?).</p>
        <p class="p2">3. Listen to your favorite song again (if you’re not listening to it now). Without leaving your house, try to tell the same story in 20 images. I personally find it a bit difficult to work with hardcore metal songs in this exercise, but any music style is welcome. If you want to go pro, try “Bohemian Rhapsody” from Queen.</p>
        <p class="p2">In the first step, you will be making a translation from one language to another with the help of a visual reference, as well as an emotional link to a story you are familiar with. The second step eliminates the visual reference and forces you to create your own, still keeping the story structure and the description of places and characters which you might find helpful. The last step forces you to decode a story (if any) and interpret it with just acoustic information or stimulus ... don’t forget the chorus!</p>
        <p class="p2">Needless to say, you are free to use your own archive of images and the infinite resources on the Internet to tell your stories, but I strongly encourage you to go out and shoot. It is way more fun! You will have passed the test if you can show the series to your mother or friend and they can guess which movie, book, or song you are picturing.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><a href="http://www.saraterry.com/">Sara Terry</a>: C</strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>omposing in Color<br />
        </strong></span>For a color photographer, learning how to compose in color is as important as learning to compose with elements of ratio, framing,<br />
        lines, etc. I got a great tip from a fellow photographer when I was just beginning about sensitizing your eye to color composition. Here it is:</p>
        <p class="p2">Walk down the street (without a camera) and choose a color—a specific color—that you see in something around you: a street sign, someone’s shoes, a mailbox, whatever draws your eye. Then look for that exact color in other places as you continue to walk down the street. If you chose mint green, make sure you’re looking for mint green—not apple green, or forest green, or khaki green. Mint green. After you’ve searched for your chosen color for a few blocks, move on to another color. This is a great way to train your eye to see color and to recognize it within the context of a broader canvas of activity.</p>
        <p class="p2">I also came up with my own color exercise that I’ve found useful. You can do this while you’re walking, but I think it’s easier to do when sitting. Say, for example, you’re having coffee with a friend. While you’re talking, or listening, pick out the repetition of color in front of you, around you, behind your friend. If your friend’s coffee cup is red, for example, you might notice that the person at the next table has a red bag, or that the woman at the counter behind your friend has red nail polish, or that the sign pointing to the bathroom is in red, or that someone has thrown a red ball through the air. When I do this, I try to let my eyes become like the lens of a camera. I kind of flatten the scene out into a 180-degree plane, picking up everything in the frame, without concentrating on any one thing—and then I “look” at what I’m seeing, letting my mind’s eye bounce around the frame that my physical eye is recording.</p>
        <p class="p2">Neither of these exercises involves taking a photo as part of the assignment. These are mental exercises that you can do anytime, anywhere. I still play with them both frequently, almost as a matter of habit. Over time you’ll find that this color play takes hold subconsciously—you’ll see it emerging in your photographs, as specific spots of color begin to provide a subtle composition in your work, moving the viewer’s eye around the image that you’ve made.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><a href="http://donaldweber.com/">Donald Weber</a>: E</strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>mpathy and a Full Stomach <br />
        </strong></span>As a photographer, I am terribly nervous. I am especially nervous around people, and find it generally terrifying to go speak with somebody I do not know. However, my career really depends on making connections with people, so I have had to figure out ways to make myself, and my subjects, comfortable.</p>
        <p class="p2">Not such an easy task, but there are ways to cope with a debilitating fear. I’ve discovered that we’re both (photographer and subject) looking to make a connection, to find a commonality that we share, allowing a fleeting moment of understanding.</p>
        <p class="p2">Often, I have been invited back to somebody’s home, place of business, wherever they feel most safe and comfortable. Here, our friendship of a few hours begins. If you can listen, deepest revelations can be shared. Many moments with total strangers have revealed much more about both of us than I have had with friends and even family; for some reason, a camera allows me to fall into a world of vulnerability. The further I am away from my own sense of reality, the more I am willing to share and let go. Same with the subjects I have photographed. With our vulnerability, comes trust. And with trust, comes access.</p>
        <p class="p2">There are times when I spend just a few minutes with a subject, other times days, and even years. But generally, it is over a meal where we form our photographic bond. And over food is when conversation happens. It’s the usual things we all share in common—friends, family, our countries, bizarre political behavior of countries’ leaders, etc. Mutual recognition, a desire to check for similarities. Are they like me? Am I like them?</p>
        <p class="p2">Sometimes I take a photo, mostly I just eat. At the end of the day, I know my photographs will be good, not because of their technical or artistic brilliance, but because our mutual vulnerabilities have allowed us to make a genuine connection, however fleeting. I often wonder if a subjects thinks, “Will he remember my soup? Our coffee together or that cup of tea? Will he remember this?”</p>
        <p class="p2">And this is what I share with my students: If you have genuinely connected with a subject, they will want this to last. Frankly, it is not about the composition of the image, but the composition of empathy. If you have empathy, you have photographs.</p>

        <p class="p1"><span class="s1">
        </span></p>
        <p class="p1"><em>In October 2013, the TV network MSNBC launched <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/">MSNBC.com</a>, a website featuring topical news reporting, photojournalism and video. Director of Photography <strong>Amy Pereira </strong>talks to PDN about the photography published on the site. Pereira was a photo editor at Newsweek from 2000 to 2011, then worked as a freelance photo editor on publications and book projects before joining MSNBC.com last May.</em></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>The amount of photojournalism MSNBC.com assigns and publishes is unusual these days. How does photography fit the mission of the site?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>Amy Pereira: </strong></span>We treat the photography as an integral element of our reporting and news coverage and our audience has responded very positively to it. Our homepage was designed to be very visual, generously showcasing photos from the ten featured articles. It was designed with a magazine feel in mind, more so perhaps than many traditional current-events sites.</p>
        <p class="p1">The photo desk gets about 40 picture requests every day, with stories coming in throughout the day and evening as well as on weekends. We find photos for a variety of types of content.</p>
        <p class="p1">We are a progressive organization and as such we cover social issues surrounding equality, race, gender and sexuality, the environment, income inequality, healthcare and politics. Fortunately, these subjects lend themselves beautifully to visual storytelling.</p>
        <p class="p1">Our national reporters are all working on in-depth, long-form features. For many of those we commission original photography. Often with the features we will publish a companion photo essay. We also try to publish three to five photo essays each week (including the Week in Pictures every Friday) and those are a combination of commissioned stories and existing work that a photographer or an agency has pitched to us or we have found through research.</p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>What’s the relationship between the coverage on MSNBC.com and the TV shows?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>AP: </strong></span>We cover stories—with reporters and photojournalists—that often feed into TV shows, serving as a jumping off point for discussions of issues that matter to our audience online and on TV. We find that shows will frequently broadcast the images attached to one of these stories as the discussions unfold in the studio. They are a powerful addition to the mix of discussion on air, providing impact and variety for the TV audience.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s3"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><strong>Who are the readers of MSNBC.com? <br />
        </strong><span class="s1"><strong>AP: </strong></span>We have a large audience online that has grown four-fold since launch just six months ago. The readers are a mixture of general news consumers, progressive activists, TV fans and people who want to become experts on a given issue. They are generally younger than our TV audience, well educated and with a strong desire to be informed.</p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>What’s the division of labor in the photo department?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>AP: </strong></span>We have a pretty small photo department and everyone works really hard. Currently, we have three associate photo editors (Olivia Kestin, Maria Lokke and Johnny Simon), one senior photo editor, Elissa Curtis, and then myself. The three associate photo editors cover most of our daily stories as well as work on some of the photo essays and features. They are very busy! Much of what they do is research but they also do some assigning as well. The senior photo editor and I focus on most of the larger commissioned features and photo essays (and Elissa also does the Week in Pictures). Everyone jumps in and helps as needed.</p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>Who are some of the photographers you’ve worked with?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>AP: </strong></span>Peter van Agtmael photographed coal mining in Appalachia and more recently worked on a story on the Choctaw Nation. That came from one of our national reporters and I thought Peter would lend an interesting visual perspective to that. Brian <span class="s4">Finke photographed the Creation Museum </span>n Kentucky. Bill Nye was scheduled to have a debate on evolution with Ken Ham, the president of the museum, so I wanted to do something on it as an interesting piece of Americana and thought Brian would have fun with that. Carolyn Drake worked on a story about immigrant families in Alabama with national reporter Benjy Sarlin, and Elissa [Curtis] also assigned her to shoot a story on healthcare in Arkansas with Geoffrey Cowley, our health policy reporter. John Trotter photographed a food pantry in [the] Bedford-Stuyvesant [section of Brooklyn, New York]. That story originally came from a pitch by a reporter on Chris Hayes’s show, <em>All In</em>, but John really connected with a family involved with the pantry and ended up spending quite a lot of time with them so we were able to break off from what was originally more of a policy/ budget story and made this lovely photo essay out of it as well. Then <em>All In </em>ended up using [the images] in a long segment on air, expanding their coverage.</p>
        <p class="p1">We’re open to anything. We wanted to publish Matt Black’s work on migrant workers in California’s Central Valley so I commissioned him to create a film around it, adding new video and interviews to complete it. Something else he did, which was wonderful, is he asked some local musicians to write the score for the film. When [national reporter] Trymaine Lee went to Florida for the George Zimmerman verdict, I assigned Wayne Lawrence to photograph Goldsboro, [an historic African-American community, not far from where Trayvon Martin was killed], to examine the social and economic state of the area before and after his death.</p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>Are you working mainly with photographers you’ve worked with in the past or are you open to finding new photographers?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>AP: </strong></span>We’ve published some great bodies of photography blogs—any venue showing serious reportage really. The photo department meets every other week to go over pitches and to discuss future photo essays and assignments.</p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>What qualities, skills or expertise make a photographer right for one of your assignments?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>AP: </strong></span>We are looking not only for great photographers, those who can compose an engaging and interesting photograph, but they should also be solid journalists who can report a story with depth and intelligence. That includes complete, accurate captions, [and] multiple aspects and perspectives on a story.</p>
        <p class="p1">I have a particular love of photo essays, which are so much more than just a series of photos in a slide show.</p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>What do you think distinguishes a good photo essay from a good slide show?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>AP: </strong></span>I think there’s an art to editing both but the distinction for me is that a slide show is a collection of interesting photos, and a photo essay is an in-depth, reported story that goes beyond any one picture. It’s the storytelling aspect that is crucial and that takes reporting, research, and, over time, intimacy and depth. Apart from the photographs, which work with one another to inform and play off each other almost in conversation, there is also the importance of informative and meaningful captions. We also always have a written introduction work from photographers who were new to us, like Oksana Yushko [who photographed “Unwanted people: A portrait of Crimea”] and Greg Kahn [on the effect of rising sea levels on communities along the Maryland shore].</p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>Where are you looking for new work?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>AP: </strong></span>We spend a lot of time researching and watching what people are doing. We look at agencies, of course, photographer’s websites, Instagram and other social platforms, award and grant winners, or essay to go with photo essays. We rarely publish a picture story without adding to it.</p>
        <p class="p1">We publish three to five photo essays a week and choose them based on different factors. Sometimes it’s because of current events, as with Victor Blue on assignment in Afghanistan to cover the election. Other times it’s a good subject for our audience, like Charles Ommanney’s gun control story, which he had shot previously but never published.</p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>What’s the purpose of the MSNBC.com Instagram feed (@msnbcphoto)?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>AP: </strong></span>I see it as an extension of our site, another editorial tool to showcase the work we do. It’s the fastest growing major mobile platform with an audience whose sole purpose is to look at photography, so it seems like a natural fit. We kicked it off in March with Mark Peterson covering CPAC [Conservative Political Action Conference] for us, and Wayne Lawrence, Balazs Gardi and Jared Moossy at the South by Southwest Music Conference and Festival (SXSW). Everything that’s on our Instagram feed is either from an assignment, the Week in Pictures or from a photo essay that we have featured on the site. With the IG feed, the hope is that we are generating interest in the subjects we cover and maybe even furthering a public discourse around these issues and at the same time, building a new audience for MSNBC. There are a lot of very young people on IG but they seem to be into it. They’re commenting and engaging, even though some of the pictures we’re showing are of some pretty tough subjects. I think that’s encouraging.</p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>It seems like MSNBC.com runs more overseas stories than the network does. Why?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>AP: </strong></span>I personally want to show the international stories. I think it’s important to round out our coverage and show stories to our audience that they perhaps haven’t seen otherwise or from a different perspective. I feel we have a social responsibility to show a broad range of important work.</p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>How is your work at MSNBC.com different from your previous work on print publications?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>AP: </strong></span>Very different. It’s a very fluid process: There is very little that is fixed like a print publication; you don’t put it to bed at the end of a week like at a weekly magazine. We have room to run long essays with 30 pictures if we want, or to write a 1,000-word introduction if that’s what works best.</p>
        <p class="p1">Because we are building this from the ground up and working very hard at it, there is a really positive sense of possibility and community here. Each of us is very vested in it and we want to do good work. That’s inspiring and very exciting.</p>

        <p class="p1">When <a href="http://florahanitijo.com/">Flora Hanitijo</a> received the call from UK-based magazine Port to go and photograph legendary jazz pianist Ahmad Jamal, she didn’t know what to expect, and she certainly didn’t anticipate an experience that she says gave her “the jitters for days” after the shoot. “I just thought it was another portrait job, and I had to do a video,” she recalls.</p>
        <p class="p1">Hanitijo, who estimates that 60 percent of her work is editorial and the rest commercial, photographed and shot video of Jamal at his home outside of New York City. “I was in his living room with two baby grand Steinway [pianos], recording him playing for me all day long.” The next day, she says, he played Carnegie Hall. The shoot appeared in the Winter 2013 issue of Port, the quarterly men’s general interest magazine, and Port used Hanitijo’s 2-minute video to promote the issue.</p>
        <p class="p1">Port was “really cool about a lot of creative freedom,” she says, something that characterizes her favorite editorial jobs. But Jamal himself made this particular assignment memorable. Hanitijo says he was an “awesome” presence, who was humble and “respectful of my work,” spending most of a day with her and her audio tech, “which was so kind of him.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Hanitijo says she chooses which editorial work to take based on whether the job makes sense for her creatively, and then evaluates the budget. “If it doesn’t add to my portfolio and [take me] where I want to go, I step back and look at it and see if it’s worth it or not.” At times she’ll come away from an editorial shoot with good images for her portfolio, but the experience isn’t great due to factors like “weather, personalities, production, budget.”</p>
        <p class="p1">This was an instance where the experience made the shoot. “Meeting a really graceful, talented person—that was what was so great,” she says. “A lot of the time you meet such amazing people doing portrait work,” she adds.</p>

Yet the creative freedom, challenges, experiences and opportunities to make great pictures offer photographers something they can't get from any other type of work.

        <p class="p1">While he shoots occasional advertising jobs, <a href="http://brianfinke.com/">Brian Finke</a>’s work is primarily editorial and he likes it that way. “I love to be busy working, so I always try to fit jobs in,” he says. Finke doesn’t promote himself to editorial clients heavily. However, he has made personal projects that he has published in books, exhibited in galleries such as ClampArt in New York City and Galerie Wouter van Leeuwen in Amsterdam, and shared online.</p>
        <p class="p1">As a result, he says, he gets calls from editors when the subject matter suits his personal style. “I get called to go and make my pictures,” he explains.</p>
        <p class="p1">Finke evaluates which editorial assignments to take based on the subject matter and the editor who calls. When <em>National Geographic </em>asked him to spend six weeks in Texas creating a photo essay about “America’s love of meat,” it wasn’t a tough decision. The editors at <em>National Geographic </em>tapped Finke, who had never worked for the magazine, in part because he often posts images of his own barbecue and grilling exploits on <a href="http://instagram.com/brianfinke">his Instagram feed</a>.</p>
        <p class="p1">So far he’s photographed cowboys and slaughterhouses and butchers and family dinners and other subjects for the assignment, which is scheduled to appear in <em>National Geographic </em>this fall. A Texas native, Finke, who is based New York City, has wanted to do a project in his home state for years, he says. The <em>National Geographic </em>assignment “feels like one giant personal project.” Because of the amount of time <em>National Geographic </em>allows, “if something’s not working, you can go back the next day.”</p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="p1">“I come from working on assignments where you show up and work through it and produce, basically, regardless of the circumstances,” he adds. This job is “definitely spoiling me.”</p>

        <p class="p1">One of the most exciting things was just this idea of the unknown,” says <a href="http://www.ackermangruber.com/">Tim Gruber</a> of a recent assignment for <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. He and his wife and partner, Jenn Ackerman, were commissioned to capture photographs and video of Roman Tritz, a 90-year-old World War II veteran who is one of 2,000 soldiers given lobotomies by the U.S. government in an attempt to cure their post-war mental illnesses.</p>
        <p class="p1">Tritz lives alone in La Crosse, Wisconsin, and doesn’t have a telephone, so Ackerman, Gruber and writer Michael M. Phillips went to his house without knowing how he’d react to them being there. (Phillips had sent him an overnight letter in advance, but otherwise there was no communication, Gruber recalls.) “One of the more exciting things about editorial work is it allows you to be curious,” Gruber says. “There are all these possibilities before the shoot and you’re not quite sure what you’re walking into.”</p>
        <p class="p1">The photographs, which were featured in the print edition of <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>and in <a href="http://projects.wsj.com/lobotomyfiles/">a multimedia digital presentation</a>, depict Tritz in quiet moments at home; eating alone at a restaurant he’s gone to everyday for more than 30 years; and visiting a VA hospital. The video footage of Tritz became part of a short documentary film for the story’s digital package, in which he talks about his lobotomy and experiences since.</p>
        <p class="p1">Their editor for the assignment, Matthew Craig, told them he wanted photos and video that were “full of emotion and mood” that conveyed some sense of the life Tritz lives, alone and still very paranoid. Otherwise he gave them free rein.</p>
        <p class="p1">With “commercial or ad work it comes with a higher price tag, but most likely you’re giving up a great deal of creative freedom,” Gruber says. “We love editorial work because we get all of this creative freedom to go out and almost treat every assignment as if it was a shoot just for us.” Often editorial work will end up in their quarterly promo newsletters, or they will print a postcard about the assignment and send it out, Gruber says.</p>
        <p class="p1">
        </p>
        <p class="p1">He also notes that there is “a lot less hassle in editorial work,” including back and forth with clients. “We love just being out and creating. We spend too much time behind our computers as it is.”</p>

        </em><em><a href="/Why-Editorial-Works-11033.shtml">Why Editorial Works: Kareem Black for VIBE</a></em></p>
        <p>One of the main reasons still-life photographer <a href="http://www.jamiechung.com/#recent">Jamie Chung</a> shoots editorial work is because it allows him to make a lot of pictures and grow as a photographer. “Shooting and experimenting [are] the only ways I can really see getting better,” he says. And while he could try and improve on his own, working with magazine art directors and photo editors leads to “a collaborative growth where I’m pushed stylistically or conceptually,” he says, which has been “a big part of the improvement” in his work. “It makes my eye sharper and makes me faster and able to shoot different types of things.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Chung also publishes the editorial work he’s happiest with on his blog, and enters it in contests, which he says are “a really good platform to get your name out there.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Editorial work also offers a variety of different assignments that are “life-enriching,” Chung says. “I’ve been able to have all of these experiences where I’m traveling to shoot [in interesting places] ... I want to work with interesting people and shoot interesting things, that’s why I got into this, so I feel a lot of fulfillment there.”</p>
        <p class="p1">One of Chung’s favorite assignments from last year came from <em>Document Journal</em>, a print and digital publication devoted to esthetics. The Frick Collection, a New York City museum, was getting ready to open the first American exhibition of the work of nineteenth century French sculptor Pierre-Jean David d’Angers. Chung went to the museum and set up a makeshift studio in the vault, working with art handlers to photograph the sculptures included in the show.</p>
        <p class="p1">The brief from <em>Document Journal </em>specified that Chung do something different than one might see in a museum catalogue. “That was perfect for me,” Chung says. His images, which he shot on black seamless, are lit to bring out the beautiful texture of the works.</p>

        <em>It's no secret that budgets for editorial photography are often slim, deadlines are frequently tight and subjects can be less than accommodating. Yet the creative freedom, challenges, experiences and opportunities to make great pictures offer photographers something they can't get from any other type of work. In this first in a series of articles about editorial photography, which originally appeared in the June Photo Annual issue of </em>PDN<em>, Kareem Black talks about a great editorial jobs he recently shot for VIBE, and about what editorial work means to him.</em>
        <p>I want to do more editorial work,” exclaims <a href="http://www.kareemblack.com/">Kareem Black</a>. “I hate going to Barnes &amp; Noble and seeing all the magazines that I’m not in.” Black works mostly on advertising jobs, and is happy to do so, but he’s making a concerted effort, including creating new promos targeted at editors, to get more editorial assignments into the mix of his business.</p>
        <p>“I’m not as worried about numbers as my agent is,” Black says. “That’s what they’re paid for. I want to take some fucking pictures.” While commercial assignments are more lucrative, editorial work is about “the adventures and the pictures,” Black says. And it’s also valuable promotion, he believes. “Your successes in editorial are very public. Money is rarely the driving force in editorial photography. Editorial can be great promotion.”</p>
        <p><em>VIBE</em> magazine is among the editorial clients Black does have, and he’s admired the magazine since he was an undergraduate. “<em>VIBE</em> was on the level of <em>Rolling Stone</em> for me [as a young photographer],” he says. “I always have a special place in my heart for <em>VIBE</em>.”</p>
        <p>Black has photographed three covers for the magazine, including a recent shoot with the comedian Kevin Hart for <em>VIBE</em>’s Race Issue, which was released in December of last year. That shoot presented an interesting challenge, Black says. The topic of race is “by nature potentially incendiary,” so the question was, “How do we navigate the race issue ... in a smart way?” Black explains, “When the call came in I was definitely interested in that aspect of the challenge.”</p>
        <p>The cover depicts Hart sitting against white seamless beneath the legs of a white model, which form an inverted-V over his head. One of the interior photographs shows the woman stepping on Hart with her stiletto.</p>

        </span><a href="/2014-9759.shtml"><em>The Market for Better-Looking Stock</em></a></p>
        <p>It’s an<strong> </strong>interesting commentary on the state of the photo industry that one of today’s more revered picture editors doesn’t work at a traditional media company. Though <a href="http://www.michaelddavis.com/">Mike Davis</a> was twice named Newspaper Picture Editor of the Year (POYi and BOP), and spent time at <em>National Geographic </em>and <em>The Oregonian</em>, for the past four years he’s primarily been a consultant, working directly with photographers on everything from editing  finished bodies of work to advising them while a series is in progress in order to fill holes in their narratives. Last fall, he also became an adjunct professor and the Alexia Tsairis Chair for Documentary Photography at Syracuse University.</p>
        <p class="p1">Being in the unique position of collaborating with a variety of photographers, who have recently included Diana Markosian, Lynn Johnson, Zun Lee, Sol Neelman, Ivan Kashinsky and Karla Gachet, gives Davis a keen insight on the direction the industry is headed.</p>
        <p class="p1">Considering the current media landscape, in which viewers are inundated with imagery, Davis believes strongly that photography with a “voice” has a better chance of breaking through the clutter. “It’s always been true, I guess, that the uniqueness of a photogra- pher and the photographer’s voice ... is what got people hired, it’s just more true now,” he explains. Davis finds the old idea that a photographer should be an impartial observer of events no longer applies. Instead, he believes the photographers whose work is sought after today “are powerful in what they say [and] in how they take a photograph.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Finding your own photographic voice can be difficult, he notes, though he likens it to a light switch being turned on: “Whether a light comes on is dependent on the person. Some people don’t have a lot of ‘self’ to explore or to express, so even though they may try, it’s not going to happen. But obviously unless you never know that is a goal, then you’ll never go there.” For Davis, this is the difference between “molding” your work to a client’s needs versus having a client hire you for the “unique way in which you perceive the world through your photographs.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Davis advises both his students at Syracuse University as well as emerging and professional photographers to create powerful and varied bodies of work that are “like the work you want to do.” Now more than ever, he notes, you will be hired based on the work you are currently shooting. “It’s a somewhat simplistic notion, but that’s what distinguishes [a photographer] ... compared to the old days of producing a general portfolio of work.”</p>
        <p class="p1">He encourages the photographers he works with to explore their subject matter in a way that is “dynamic and dimensional.” Davis explains, “The assumption is [that] the more complex the ‘why’ is, the more interesting the ‘how’ can be and the more directed [the images] will be.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Additionally, a body of work should explore a subject from all angles. He cites the clich&eacute; of a photographer following around one homeless person and creating a single body of work from the images. Davis suggests instead focusing on poverty and the many ways it’s manifested in society. While homelessness can still be a part of the project, he explains, the project may cover other aspects, like the food eaten at a homeless shelter, the places where the homeless sleep, the cardboard signs panhandlers hold.</p>
        <p class="p1">Equally important is presenting the work in the most emotionally powerful way possible, and also taking into account the platform on which it will be displayed. “I think increasingly you have to think about how you edit a body of work [for] the different places where it will live, and photography can live in so many more different places.” Essentially, every platform requires a different edit: a website, a print portfolio, a photo book, a gallery exhibition, an app. “Each one of [these places] does require a different way of thinking—in that the space where photographs live does have a pretty significant context: how you treat them, how you sequence them, how it feels when one sits next to another.”</p>
        <p class="p1">For many photographers, Davis creates selections of 12, 20, 40 and 60 images, depending on where the series will be presented. He adds, “a lot of the core relationships between the photographs stay the same but with some variability.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Having twice edited portfolios that won POYi’s Magazine Photographer of the Year honors, and having three times edited portfolios that earned POYi’s Newspaper Photographer of the Year honors, Davis firmly believes that the sequencing of images can impact how viewers (and contest judges) see them. Many elements are taken into account when Davis sequences images, including color, light, composition and where the subject is in the frame, but he rarely goes into those details with a photographer until a goal of what the work should communicate is set.</p>
        <p class="p1">Davis strongly agrees with many in the industry who believe that, thanks to the increase in imagery that surrounds us now, the “visual literacy of the world is growing.” That change isn’t necessarily a bad thing, he notes. But it does mean that the quality of work and the way in which it is presented is even more important as a photographer builds his or her career. And it means that getting advice on honing and shaping a project is more valuable than ever.</p>
        <p class="p1">“I think now there is a greater need for picture editors and people who can craft visual narratives [to] help photographers develop [their work],” Davis says, “at a time when there are fewer of us than there have [historically] been.”</p>

        <p class="p1">For years,<strong> </strong>news about the stock industry concerned the downward pressure on prices and bargain discounts, or the ridicule of clich&eacute;d and corny stock imagery on the Internet. But in the past year, two agencies have made gambles on the market for existing images of better and higher production values. Though the two agencies take very different approaches to the business of licensing images, both are trying to appeal to busy art buyers and researchers who need images and don’t want to spend the time to wade through giant archives to find them.</p>
        <p class="p1">In February, <a href="http://www.trunkarchive.com/">Trunk Archive</a>, the rights-managed licensing agency that handles the archives of 350 fashion, advertising and celebrity photographers, acquired rep group Bernstein &amp; Andriulli (B&amp;A) and its subsidiary <a href="http://www.gallerystock.com/">Gallery Stock</a>, the stock agency known for its roster of fine-art photographers like Stephen Shore and Larry Fink, as well as many commercial shooters. Gallery Stock began in 2005 when its founder, Bill Charles of Bill Charles Represents, formed a joint venture with Howard Bernstein, co-founder of B&amp;A. While B&amp;A and Gallery Stock will retain their brand identities under Trunk Archive’s ownership and continue to operate under Bernstein’s direction, the acquisition brings under one company the right to license images by many well-known photographers.</p>
        <p class="p1">“They have made imagery available that typically wasn’t available because you had A-list photographers who didn’t want to go with one of the [traditional] stock agencies and now they’ve found a place that will be respectful of their work and much more in control and protective of it,” says Juliette Wolf-Robin, the national executive director of the trade association American Photographic Artists.</p>
        <p class="p1">Many of the images that Trunk Archive and Gallery Stock offer were shot on assignments for clients who have the budgets for great preproduction and styling. “They’re better crafted images,” notes Toby Kaufmann, photo director at <em>fitness</em>, which regularly sources beauty and lifestyle images, as well as whole stories, from Trunk Archive. She runs the images prominently, she says. “It’s not stock as we used to think of it. It’s not running a 1/16 of a page: It’s opening a story.” While the magazine’s photo researcher will regularly search through large image archives like Getty Images, Alamy and Corbis Images to find quality work, Kaufmann says, “It’s exhausting.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Yvonne Stender, photography director at <em>Sunset</em>, says Trunk Archive and Gallery Stock are her “go-to sources,” particularly when she wants an image that’s “evocative rather than literal.” She says, “I know I’ll never see the images I see on Gallery Stock or Trunk anywhere else.” Stender believes readers no longer respond to clich&eacute;d stock shots, and are “starting to have a better visual acumen.” When she can find it in her budget, she’s willing to pay more for what Trunk Archive and Gallery Stock offer. “They’re better esthetic quality, frankly, and their prices reflect that.” Kaufmann estimates that an image from Trunk Archive used as a full page typically costs around $1,000, which is more than she would pay at most large stock agencies.</p>
        <p class="p1">The royalty-free stock agency <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/">Shutterstock</a> is now bringing the idea of high-quality, well-curated imagery to the lower priced, royalty-free market. In September 2013, Shutterstock launched a new division called Offset, featuring assignment outtakes and personal images by successful commercial photographers including Gentl and Hyers, Maura McEvoy, David Prince and Stephen Frink as well as images submitted by other stock libraries and archives. “We realized there was a true need for higher end imagery, and we developed Offset to answer that need that our clients have,” says Keren Sachs, director of content development at Shutterstock.</p>
        <p class="p1">“People can often have a notion of what a stock image looks like and with Offset, we’re trying to change people’s minds and open them up to what other things can be considered stock,” Sachs says.</p>
        <p class="p1">Offset has its own logo, website and branding distinct from Shutterstock. Offset is significantly smaller than its parent company: It currently has 75,000 images by more than 150 artists, compared with the 35 million images by more than 55,000 artists Shutterstock offers. Its team of curators chooses images that have contemporary art direction and style, look authentic and tell a story.</p>
        <p class="p1">Prices for individual images on Offset are higher than for Shutterstock, but direct comparisons can be difficult to make since they have different pricing plans. With Offset, users pay $250 for a small image of about 3 MB and $500 for a large image of around 50 MB—though enterprise clients can receive custom pricing. Shutterstock sells various levels of subscriptions, but users can also choose multi-image packs. One enhanced license plan offers two images for $199, for example, and another 25 images for $1,699.</p>
        <p class="p1">This is still less than the high-end licensing agencies charge, and photography advocates like Wolf-Robin believe royalty-free agencies devalue imagery.</p>
        <p class="p1">One agency that contributes to the Offset image collection is trying both the rights-managed and royalty-free models. The Licensing Project (TLP), which offers rights-managed licensing of images by dozens of fashion, editorial and commercial photographers, has submitted roughly 2,000 images shot by some of its photographers to Offset, according to TLP Managing Director Josef Siegle. The images he sends to Offset are quick release—not requiring model or individual artist approval—but have the polished esthetic of other TLP images, Siegle says. (Some photographers on TLP’s roster have declined to participate—typically because they want approval for how their images are used.) He thinks royalty-free can be a good deal for photographers of still-life and other images not requiring releases, making up in volume what is lost in large fees. “It is also opening up completely different markets to our brand,” he says. As he recruits new photographers to TLP, he’s letting them know that marketing through Offset is an option. Siegle adds, “The Offset website traffic should also increase our online presence when clients see our credit line on Offset.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Busy photo editors and art buyers say they care more about the quality of the image—and how quickly they can find it—than how much they pay for it.</p>
        <p class="p1">Michael Wichita, director of photography at AARP Media, says he wouldn’t ignore a good stock photograph no matter what the pricing structure or how many other clients can license it. “We’re very lucky that it still comes down to finding the right image for the right story and being able to give it the play it deserves.” Joe Rodriguez, associate photo editor of <em>men’s Health </em>magazine, says he welcomes new entrants in the licensing market. “It gives buyers more places to look,” he says, “and everyone wants more options, don’t they?”</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        In his 25 years as an automotive photographer, <a href="http://timdamon.net/">Tim Damon</a> has made almost every kind of image that car clients demand: performance shots on race tracks, cars and trucks in dramatic landscapes, and lots of studio shots, sometimes done on his 18,000-square-foot stage in Los Angeles. But whatever the assignment, his goal is to bring out the unique contours of each car. “When designers sculpt a car, they want all those lines and shapes to be celebrated,” he explains. “What normally happens is that a client gives me a preferred angle: ‘This will be a three-quarter, passenger-side rear view.’ Once we set the angle, my job is to use lighting to make it look its best.”
        <p class="p1">Recently Damon got to employ all his skills for what he calls “a dream job” for Ferrari. The car manufacturer gave him a new car for two days, and asked him to take some “cool pictures” any way he liked. The four shots he came up with included outdoor shots and a shot he created in his studio, which he turned into a dark parking garage. Using multiple lights and a camera rig, he shot a long exposure, capturing the moving car in crisp detail, while the dark walls around the car blurred.</p>
        <p class="p1">The studio easily accommodated the rig, which lifted the camera about 20 feet above the car, and scaffolding on which Damon stood to look down on the scene. The studio also provides storage for all the lights, cameras, gear, and camera trucks that Damon and his production company, Square Planet Media, own and use.</p>
        <p class="p1">The studio also serves another purpose. Damon says he always prefers to get the shot he wants in camera. “It is sometimes easier just to fix it in the computer, but I would rather work harder and get it in camera.” However, if a location shoot isn’t working the way he wants, he may bring the car to his studio to get an additional shot for a composite. “That’s why it’s important for me to have my own stage: I don’t want my hands to be tied.” On a recent shoot for Lincoln, for example, he photographed the car in early morning light on a hill overlooking Los Angeles. The silver car’s reflective surface wasn’t showing all the colors of the city lights, however, and to Damon’s eye, looked detached. Back in his studio, he says, “I could use colored gels and different types of lighting sources to give the vehicle more shape and depth,” then he had his retoucher composite the two shots (see final image below).</p>
        <p class="p1">Damon believes that his clients come to him knowing that he prefers not to rely on compositing, and he finds the challenge more fun. “I’d rather do the extra work,” he says, than have a retoucher do a job Damon enjoys. “I believe that if I get a Christmas card from a retoucher, I’m not doing my job.”</p>
        <p class="p2"><strong>Logistics</strong></p>
        <p class="p1">For his studio shot of the Ferrari, Damon’s crew set up black cloths and flats to block off an area of the white studio and make it look like the inside of a parking structure. Damon mounted the camera to one of the rigs he designed himself for car photography. It was attached to the rear of the car, extended about 25 feet and lifted the camera about 20 feet high. Damon wanted the driver to maneuver the car out of the studio’s cyclorama. During a long exposure, the background would blur while the rig-mounted camera, moving along with the car, would keep the vehicle in focus.</p>
        <p class="p1">The lighting had to be adjusted to accommodate the movement of the car. “When you’re doing a rig shot you don’t put a light here and there. It’s not like playing sheet music, it’s like playing jazz,” says the photographer. “The only way you’re going to get it is to start doing your exposure and then moving your lights. It sounds tedious but it’s fun.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Damon oversaw the scene from scaffolding about 20 feet above the floor. To preview his work, he usually uses a second, smaller camera on the rig to deliver a live video feed, but on this shoot, it wouldn’t show him the blurred effect of the long exposure. To see that, he also tethered his main camera to a monitor so he and the digital tech could preview the actual shots and test the lights.</p>
        <p class="p2"><strong>Lighting</strong></p>
        <p class="p1">“I say this all the time: Black cars separate the men from the boys,” Damon notes, because bringing out the contours in the dark metal is challenging and unforgiving.</p>
        <p class="p1">He begins by lighting the car—“It’s the most important thing,” he says—but because the car is reflective, he has to consider how he’s lighting the background at the same time.</p>
        <p class="p1">One Kino Flo created a streak of light on the window on driver’s side. Another light made the streak along the roofline. A line of Kinos was also positioned on the floor, with another slightly higher to create the line of light along the back of the car.</p>
        <p class="p1">He placed one of the softboxes that he had made above the car; measuring 40 x 15 feet, the light is visible at the top of the frame as a streak of light. He says he positioned it to bring out the crease just above the driver’s door handle.</p>
        <p class="p1">He also used a 10K ARRI tungsten light with a Fresnel just outside the left side of the frame, down stage. This light illuminated the floor and, in the long exposure, made it glow.</p>
        <p class="p1">“Funny, I like big, big, big lights. I use old ones with big Fresnels on them,” he says. He prefers the quality of light from a tungsten rather than HMI, which Damon says feels “clinical.” When using a big light source like this, he positions it far from his subject. “If I flag off an area, it’s a softer transition than if you put a barn door on a 1K: That’s a harsh transition.” Using a large light source, he adds, “gives me the ability to come in with hot lights and kiss an area with hot lights. It won’t feel forced.” For example, he used an ARRI 1K tungsten light just to illuminate the area near the taillight on the driver’s side. Without illuminating that small area, he says, “There’s no shape there. I added the light so it’s more convex.”</p>
        <p class="p2"><strong>Camera</strong></p>
        <p class="p1">A Hasselblad H4D camera with a 50-110mm f/3.5-4.5 HC AF lens was used for the Ferrari shoot. Damon estimates it was an eight- to 12-second exposure.</p>
        <p class="p2"><strong>Post-Production</strong></p>
        <p class="p1">The studio shot of the Ferrari, one of four he delivered to the client, needed only slight retouching to remove the arm of the rig, a job Damon’s digital tech, Anthony Dias, performed. On jobs requiring compositing, Damon has the retoucher on set throughout the shoot, then produces a tight comp to show the client how the finished shot will look. “It is absolutely the best way to work,” he says. “Everyone is there: the retoucher, the client, the agency. We can make decisions and get everything expedited really fast.”</p>

He is the executive director of Global Voices, a nonprofit online global citizen media initiative. He is a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard university, where he studies digital storytelling and online communities.</em></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>In 2012, you taught a course, “New Directions in Visual Storytelling,” in the master’s photojournalism program at Corcoran College of Art &amp; Design. Who were your students, and what were you hoping to teach?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>Ivan Sigal: </strong></span>My students were aspiring professional photographers, videographers and content creators who hope to be working in journalism. My intent was to help them understand that the mass-media market is no longer a given and that to have careers they need to have critical thinking around the stories they make and how they were making them, and to ask certain questions:</p>
        <p class="p1">What’s the goal of my project? Which technology best serves my project? What is my audience and what is the best platform to reach them? For instance, if my audience is a poor community that primarily gets most of its news from the radio and they don’t have a lot of Internet access, does it make sense to do a rich HTML5 presentation?</p>
        <p class="p1">Given that we now create work in networked environments, in which subjects are often telling their own stories, to what extent do I engage them in the creation of the content? What are the intended effects of the work: informational, educational, transformative?</p>
        <p class="p1">Answering these questions may change the way you work.</p>
        <p class="p1">When we submitted work to mass-media publications, these questions were taken care of for us by the publication. If you’re building a story without the support of a media institution, it becomes more important to understand who might consume or participate in your project and what kind of relationship you want to build with them. These choices will affect the way you tell the story.</p>
        <p class="p1">Is the goal to make something that is beautiful? Is it informational or educational or dialogical? Is the goal to persuade? Perhaps a photo essay isn’t the most effective form; maybe there’s another way to make sure that the people affected [by the issue you’re covering] are heard.</p>
        <p class="p1">I think it’s helpful to make work with an understanding of where that work will live. Work made with this understanding has a force and value that could transcend a two-minute engagement.</p>
        <p class="p1">There have been a lot of projects involving creative use of technology that have failed. I think there’s nothing wrong with failure when you’re testing new technologies and tools. It can be challenging to create a workflow so the story is not overwhelmed by the technology. But I think you have to be comfortable with a certain amount of risk.</p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>Risk of what, failure? Or loss of control over the use<br />
        of your image?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>IS: </strong></span>That’s one kind of risk in this market. Some people are vigilant about policing the sharing of their work and I don’t criticize them. Others are more comfortable sharing.</p>
        <p class="p1">We know that in a networked media environment, what’s abundant is content. What’s scarce is attention. You’re competing against everything for attention: talk, stories, Hollywood, social media, games—all occurring on the same screens. That’s the radical shift we’ve experienced. We also have immediate feedback on what people will or won’t pay attention to. In that context, sharing material is one way to draw attention.</p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>Is interactivity important? It seems like it’s sometimes incorporated into online stories as a way for media producers to attract attention, but it doesn’t always inspire engagement.<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>IS: </strong></span>Personally, I think that bringing audience and producer closer together is a good thing for a couple of reasons. The first is transparency: It asks us when we make something to be aware that the person you’re representing will see your work. That makes our work better and more honest.</p>
        <p class="p1">It also changes the idea that we have a producer and we have audience, and they are separate. We have a lot of language we use, such as “immersive,” “interactive” or “participatory,” to describe this change.</p>
        <p class="p1">I think it’s important to ask ourselves why we’re trying to make the work. We tend to get fascinated with technology. Sometimes as a result the story serves the technology, rather than the other way around.</p>
        <p class="p1">There’s no sense in making an HTML5 presentation out of every 800-word news item, but there are stories where just a touch of interactivity can enhance it. The medium changes the story. If you’re making a photo book, it’s linear, but a Web platform doesn’t require you to be linear. Much of the media we see online are using older forms transplanted onto the screens in front of us. We want to be conscious of that.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s3"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><strong>It sounds like your course was somewhat vocational: To survive as a photojournalist you need to know how to produce more than seven- to 12-image photo essays.<br />
        </strong><span class="s3"><strong>IS: </strong></span><span class="s4">There are other ways of conceptualizing, preparing and sharing work now. What’s the value of restricting yourself to that form? At least ask the question.</span></p>
        <p class="p1">For instance, if your goal is to advocate for change on an issue or policy, showing an issue from a single author’s point of view might no longer be the most effective strategy. We now have the technology to have dialogue with people we’re documenting. Why isn’t that what we’re doing? It is at least worth exploring the affordances<br />
        of our technologies that allow us to communicate with the people we’re documenting.</p>
        <p class="p1">There are numerous recent examples of this. Sandy Storyline created a platform that combines the documentation of professionals and subjects affected by Hurricane Sandy, adding layers of advocacy and conversation to the journalism. Homicide Watch D.C. works closely with communities to document every killing in the city, shifting the structure of homicide stories away from the relative importance of the victim or the sensational nature of a given murder, and emphasizing that many homicides that hadn’t been reported in the news still deeply affect the communities in which they occur.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s3"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><strong>One school of thought says that to survive in photojournalism, you have to be entrepreneurial, and act as your own publisher, agent,</strong><span class="s4"> </span><strong>fundraiser. Another school says that to survive you need to be part of a team producing a larger, richer experience of storytelling. What do you think of those arguments?<br />
        </strong><span class="s3"><strong>IS: </strong></span><span class="s4">I think you have to be entrepreneurial within a team.</span></p>
        <p class="p1">Let’s take a step back. What’s really important is to find the collaborators you need to make your project successful. I’m not sure the [photo] agency model serves that need. Perhaps it’s more of a Hollywood model, whereby people with specialized skills gather to work on a project. Some magazines, newspapers and agencies will be large enough to have those teams in-house, but a lot of media outlets won’t. If you’re a freelancer, you may need to come together with other freelancers in a collaborative project outside of institutions.</p>
        <p class="p1">Some of these collaborations are occurring because people meet in story hackathons, or reviews. Others find collaborators through informal networks or university settings. There is no single way to find the collaborators you might need. An interactive Web documentary might need a photographer, a video editor, someone with database skills, someone who knows Java, someone else who is a front-end designer. Sandy Storyline is a good example of a project like this—collaborative, not based in an institution, with a lot of volunteer effort. And sometimes creative use of off-the-shelf plug-ins and applications can make great projects. Not everything needs to have a massive budget.</p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>What did your students think of the course, and the examples of different kinds of visual storytelling you shared?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>IS: </strong></span>For the most part, they were excited because one of the goals was to help them incorporate the ideas and the tools into their work. It was a chance to experiment. Some are now thinking about co-creating work with the communities they care about. Some interesting projects came from that.</p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>What about the students who didn’t like the course? Why didn’t they?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>IS: </strong></span>There weren’t many who disliked it. I think some were less interested in the social and economic questions; they just want to produce the work that makes sense to them. For some, that will be a great strategy. There’s definitely an argument that one should make work without too much regard for the context in which it will appear; a lot of brilliant and difficult material is produced with this attitude, and for many projects I also work this way. My primary point is: Ask yourself why you make the choice.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s3"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><strong>In your work on Global Voices, what have you learned from the citizen journalists you’ve worked with and what do you wish journalists in big media centers like New York City or London understood about them?<br />
        </strong><span class="s1"><strong>IS: </strong></span>I’ve learned a tremendous amount. Global Voices is a community of volunteer writers, editors and translators. We try to find stories that are interesting and important to local communities that are not well-represented in global media, and we explain and amplify their work. The inclinations and news frames of mass media become evident: We see who’s quoted, who’s not quoted, who’s given space. One reason that people participate in Global Voices is they want the chance to change the way people talk about the place they’re from.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s3"><strong><em>PDN</em>: </strong></span><strong>A lot of professional journalists see “citizen journalists” as competition, as lowballers undermining the value of their reporting or images.<br />
        </strong><span class="s1"><strong>IS: </strong></span>To my mind professional and citizen are not opposing concepts. The question that interests me is why people choose to make and share images or to report on stories when it’s not a job. Many of the Global Voices reporters are professionals but they’re not writing for Global Voices for professional reasons; they’re doing it for civic reasons. If you think that civic engagement is important, and you believe that sharing information and stories improves engagement, then to me it makes sense to support [civilian journalism]. It doesn’t make sense to me to disparage people’s ability to create and share their work. As a society, I think we are enriched by it. </p>
        <p class="p1">One of the characteristics of a networked media ecology is that the center doesn’t hold. Yes, there are concentrations of capital and talent, like New York City and London, but the idea of “foreign” is becoming obsolete to me. What is interesting about network structures is that work by talented people can be [found] anywhere. If there are whole worlds and stories that are outside your focus, it’s easier than ever [to find them]. Rather than send a photographer to Tunisia, it’s good to also contact someone in Tunisia to tell the stories of the people there. It’s not necessarily worse.</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<em>Photographer <a href="http://www.amandamarsalis.com/">Amanda Marsalis</a> makes her directorial debut this month with the premiere of the feature film </em>Echo Park<em> at the <a href="http://filmguide.lafilmfest.com/tixSYS/2014/filmguide/Title/EE">20th Los Angeles Film Festival</a>. The film stars Mamie Gummer as Sophie, a successful Beverly Hills handbag designer who, needing a change of scenery, trades one Los Angeles neighborhood for another, Echo Park. The film follows Sophie as she develops a friendship with a longtime resident, Alex, played by Anthony Okungbowa, and comes to know this previously unfamiliar neighborhood and its culture.</em>
<p><em>Marsalis, who has lived in Echo Park for a number of years, shot the film over the course of three weeks with a crew that included a number of “old-school Hollywood guys” who were happy to help out a young director, she tells </em>PDN<em>. Marsalis met the film’s producers through a writer she photographed a few years ago, with whom she remained friends.</em></p>
<p>PDN<em> spoke with Marsalis in April to find out what she learned about filmmaking while working on her first movie.</em></p>
<p><strong>PDN: How was it learning how to direct actors?</strong></p>
<p>Amanda Marsalis: It was a learning curve. Because at first—it wasn’t as if I was thinking about them as if they were models, but I was directing them more physically instead of emotionally. I was like, “I need you to do this and I need you to do that.” And I quickly learned that you do not get anything from telling actors that. You have to connect with them on an emotional level and talk about their character, and where they’re coming from and where they’re going, and where you need to get to and all of those kinds of things. I learned on set. I did not know that. There was no prep for that.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: What are the biggest things you learned?</strong></p>
<p>AM: Making a film is so much different than taking photos. And certainly they’re not related whatsoever. It takes so many people to make a film and there’s so much work that goes into it. And my photos are so reportage-y, I’m never one to set up a photograph or necessarily even think about it too much ahead of time, I just always show up and I can find the best photo in that given situation; making the film there’s months of pre-visualization, and talks about what rooms are going to look like and how things are going to change throughout the movie and what sort of visual language [we’re going to use].</p>
<p>I think it’s also changed me as a photographer because now I have a better ability to basically direct whomever I’m photographing and not just be like, “Hey, can you look to the left? Chin up!”</p>
<p><strong>PDN: How do you think making a film will influence you as a photographer?</strong></p>
<p>AM: It influenced me as a person, so that changes me as a photographer. But also I wrapped the movie and then went on a road trip with a camera and my boyfriend and just took tons of photos. I did the opposite of what I was just doing. My photo career is just like that, you know, giant production on a Norwegian cruise ship versus myself and one assistant in Merida, Mexico, for a week just discovering things. And then on the cruise ship it is all set up, we know exactly what time we’re going to be [shooting], we know exactly what our talent is going to be doing. We know what they’re going to be wearing, we know what we need, we’ve got the shot. I never like to do too much of one of them. I need the other one. Once I’ve done a few big jobs I’m like, “Please let me just go someplace by myself and take pictures for a while.”</p>
<p><strong>PDN: Who was the most important person on the crew?</strong></p>
<p>AM: I would say Maime [Gummer], our lead actress. And she’s amazing. She’s a really great actress and really good at what she does, and really beautiful and comes from an amazing family [Gummer is Meryl Streep’s daughter]. She fills those shoes.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: How was your director-actor relationship with her?</strong></p>
<p>AM: It was interesting. There is a learning curve and I was incredibly nervous and totally intimidated. As a director you have to be in charge. You have to be leading the ship and so you basically have to be like, “I totally know what I’m doing. Do this. This is what I think, this is what’s important.” And then I would go home every night and be like, “Oh my God. I hope I know what I’m doing.”</p>
<p><strong>PDN: So how did you get over the nervousness?</strong></p>
<p>AM: There was no option but to do it. There was no space for failure or for having a total breakdown or something. I was like, “I’ll just do it after the movie is over.” But then as soon as the movie is over you go into the editing room.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: How has that whole process been?</strong></p>
<p>AM: It’s been really good. We’ve been editing since August [2013] and we wrapped the picture [in March 2014]. I probably learned more about directing from editing than I did from being on set, because now I see like, “Ah, I could have used that [shot].”</p>
<p>You’re also like, “I should have shot a wide master for that scene that I could have cut out to”; all the ways you could save yourself in editing. It’s basically like shooting plates and being able to Photoshop things. And I think very experienced directors with very experienced talent don’t need to do that, as much as maybe younger, less experienced directors.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: Are you going to do a superhero movie next? Something with a lot of CGI?</strong></p>
<p>AM: I’d like to. I’d like to do Point Break. [Director] Katherine Bigelow is my favorite, I love her so much. Who knows? I’ve gotten a lot of support, which has been really wonderful and I’m very grateful for, and I’m just very hopeful that basically somebody will let me make another movie.</p>

        <p class="p1"><em>Hackathons, originally events for computer programmers to collaborate on software projects, now also serve as laboratories for journalists and photographers who want to experiment. Asim Rafiqui, a Pakistan-based photojournalist who has contributed to </em>TIME<em>, </em>Stern<em>, </em>The Wall Street Journal <em>and other publications, recounts his own hackathon experience, and explains how hackathons could help push photojournalism forward.</em></p>
        <p class="p3"><strong>Most photographers </strong>are trapped in outdated and outmoded forms of project production and conception. They are still mostly thinking of project structure in terms of linear stories, single or sequenced images, and a very basic story framework: The subject does this, then he does that, here you see her doing this and here she is doing that. Frankly, it’s all very boring and it largely comes from photographers and editors being trapped in the esthetics of the frame, and from rarely placing the image in a broader political and institutional context, from being afraid to try new stories and ideas, from a need to be published, etc. There are strong financial reasons for photojournalism conservatism— digital images and a simple online photo essay are the easiest, least expensive means to show work and require the least resources possible. Innovation and innovative storytelling approaches are inevitably more complex, and require more human labor and time.</p>
        <p class="p3">Hackathon collaborations are critical for shaking photographers out of these comfort zones, and for forcing them to see new horizons with regard to online digital presentation, navigation and sharing. Hackathons push the photographer to work outside her small camera viewfinder and allow others to understand and contribute to what she is doing. That was my own experience [working] with [game developer] Kati London at the Bit by Bit hackathon, produced collaboratively between the Columbia University Journalism School and The Brown Institute for Media Innovation in February 2014.</p>
        <p class="p3">Kati forced me to think about how digital audiences work online, share information, post thoughts and customize what they see. After all, the value of digital information comes from the fact that it can be shared easily and quickly. I had been experimenting with the idea of using images as core navigation tools for content but while working with Kati, we pushed this concept further and came up with the idea of images as containers that can be customized with information and shared over the Internet. Experimenting with an old project about American evangelicals that I shot for French <em>National Geographic</em>, we developed the idea of a “primary author” and a “secondary author.” The primary authorship is retained, but secondary authors (i.e., viewers) are able to “enhance” the image with their own thoughts, ideas, links and even images.</p>
        <p class="p3">I believe that a deeper engagement with the issues we are trying to document can reveal previously unconsidered situations, events, locations and subjects central to a story we are trying to produce. For example, in a story about Somali piracy, an awareness of the connections between international trading agreements, industrial fishing fleets and the devastation of existing economic arrangements would completely transform how such a story is produced by a photojournalist. A similar set of complex forces explains so much of what is taking place on the U.S.-Mexico border, where dozens of stories have been produced about immigrants trying to cross over, but few connect this to trade agreements like NAFTA and the creation of zones of sweatshops, and the disinvestment in agriculture from surrounding areas. There are already photographers out there working in these complex forms. Matt Black, to name one; his broad, intelligent, and humane engagement with the conditions and lived realities of people opens up all sorts of possibilities for how projects are presented and produced. Others like Rob Hornstra or Carl De Keyzer are producing complex and broad projects. Their works are intellectually complex, and that is what makes them exciting for me.</p>
        <p class="p3">Which brings me to a key point: There has been a singular focus on how technological innovations or tools will redefine photojournalism, and I think this singular hanging of hopes on technical solutions has distracted us from the storytelling possibilities the same technologies opened up. Despite all that, today we are still really only producing what are no more than traditional documentary films, though we call them “multimedia,” and assuming that this is enough. Or that various interesting website designs are all that is needed. What have not been explored are new story structures, narrative frameworks, image-to-text relationships, greater use of content and images working together, and so much else. That is, what has not really been looked at is how the entire modus operandi of a photojournalist can be redeveloped, and the ways in which entire issues can be covered.</p>
        <p class="p3">Using hackathons to reimagine photojournalism isn’t merely to boost traffic, shares and “likes.” The point is to engage audiences with important issues in deep ways, thereby moving them to action. Online readers engage the digital world in many different ways, and turn to different sources of information and entertainment at different moments. </p>
        <p class="p3">Conventionally, “action” presumes intervention based on a sense of superiority, a moral right, a social responsibility: A [Western photographer] travels out, reveals “injustice” and “saves” people. This model of “action” has been the source of much misunderstanding because it requires “victims” and “saviors,” and an erasure of complexity and our involvement. This has to change. We need a broader idea of what taking action can mean. For me, “action” as an outcome of a work can be to move people towards understanding, awareness, recognition, protest, disruption, curiosity, humility, questioning, doubt, trust, respect.</p>
        <p class="p3">In short, a move toward understanding and acknowledgement constitutes an important action; one need not do anything more. By creating works that reveal the forces—political, economic and social—that create the pathologies in the first place, we create space for a reader/viewer to choose her mode of action. Today, as a citizen of a nation responsible for violent interventions across the globe, I question whether we have a need “to act,” or whether it has become more important to question, criticize and dissent.</p>
        <p class="p3">Technological and intellectual experimentation is required, not only to engage and motivate our audiences, but to update the intellectual underpinnings of photojournalism. As I’ve argued previously on my blog:</p>
        <p class="p3"><em>... photojournalism (photographers and photo editors) has been oddly immune to transformations that have affected other fields. An entire literature has broken through from worlds previously silent. Counter narratives to debilitating colonial histories are being offered. In America alone the voices of women, African-Americans, South Asians, the indigenous, and so many others can no longer be ignored and have enhanced and illuminated our understanding of ourselves and the experiences of history ...</em></p>
        <p class="p3">Yet mainstream photojournalism still remains largely about silencing the other, and reconstructing their worlds and lives as defined by pathos, victimhood and hopelessness. Photographers still [produce] stories right out the works of Joseph Conrad, revealing the “darkest” Africa, the direst of Asiatic “despotisms” or Islamic “madness,” for example. And unlike [in] other fields, there seem to be few counter voices that make it onto the pages of our finest magazines or the podium of our finest awards.</p>
        <p class="p3">Hackathons have the potential to address [these] issues. Ideally, they would bring together not just photographer/storytellers and technologists, but also sociologists, anthropologists, ethnographers, geographers, historians, and so on to enhance the content and context of the stories we are trying to tell. There isn’t just one story, as [the writer] Chimamanda Adichie once argued, and we have to start to break the intellectual and informational structures we have become very comfortable with.</p>
        <p class="p3">For the same reason, I would love to see more editors invited to hackathons. They are the financial and editorial gatekeepers, and as employees of inherently conservative institutions, they curtail a lot of the creative energies of photographers. Few photo editors engage photographers as equals or invite them to help conceive, design, arrange or present projects. Perhaps there is no room for this in the hectic work cycle of a magazine, but certainly hackathons can begin to break this structure, by creating a space where photographers and photo editors can experiment together, and see what emerges.</p>
        <p class="p3">It’s very exciting that so many institutions are experimenting. What would be useful is if there is a way to catalogue and share all the experiments being done so others can build upon them. At the moment, I fear that many good ideas arising from hackathons simply disappear. I would love to know more about what arises from Photography, Expanded [an initiative of the Magnum Foundation and Open Society] brainstorming [sessions], or about how the NPR teams have thought about the issues, for instance. Some hackathons are better at disseminating ideas than others, but I would like to see a public website where anyone can explore the projects, ideas and outcomes, and use them as inspiration for their own work.</p>
        <p class="p3">These are the best of times and also the worst of times for photojournalism. Its relevance is in question, and the resources scarce as editorial publications have largely abandoned it and reduced it to simply illustrations and slide shows. It is in hackathons that photojournalists may yet again discover what had compelled them go out into the world in the first place—a need to tell an amazing story, to reveal hidden realities, to inform us of that which we had previously not known, and to do so in so compelling a fashion that we can’t help but look.</p>

        <p class="p1">The digital medium-format photography landscape changed dramatically this year and it was all because of a single chip. Manufactured by Sony, the 50-megapixel, 44 x 33mm CMOS image sensor quickly established itself as a “game changer” in the medium- format world when it first appeared in Phase One’s IQ250 digital back last January. We got our hands on an early IQ250 production unit and put the back and its much-touted chip, which is the world’s first medium-format-sized CMOS sensor, through its paces during a field test. In a nutshell, we were pleased with the photographic results. Extremely pleased, you could say.</p>
        <p class="p1">Medium-format cameras are great for capturing gorgeous, detail- rich images with massive amounts of resolution and exceptional dynamic range, but they’ve never fared particularly well when shooting at high ISOs in low light. (In fact, many digital camera backs can’t even shoot past ISO 800.) Older digital backs and their CCD sensors have traditionally produced extremely noisy images at higher ISOs that are damn near impossible to clean up in image-editing software. But just as digital SLRs successfully transitioned from CCD sensors to less noisy CMOS chips nearly a decade and a half ago, the new CMOS-powered IQ250 produced remarkably clean images for us all the way up to ISO 6400. Only a few months prior, this would have been unimaginable. But this new medium-format CMOS sensor was not limited to the Phase One back alone. In March, Hasselblad started shipping its new H5D-50c medium-format camera system, which uses the same Sony-made 50-megapixel, CMOS sensor as the IQ250. The chip will also be used in the new Pentax 645Z medium-format model.</p>
        <p class="p1">Another benefit of using a CMOS sensor instead of a CCD in a medium-format camera is that it allows these camera systems to shoot faster. In the case of the IQ250, it can shoot at 2 frames per second (fps), while the H5D-50c has a 1.5 fps capture speed. No, that’s not close to the speed of a pro DSLR, but with a medium- format sensor that has 68 percent more capture area than 35mm full-frame, that’s exceptional. And as these CMOS chips start turning up in more and more medium-format models, the best could still be yet to come. In the case of the Pentax 645Z, it may already be here. Thanks, in part, to its CMOS chip, the 645Z is the first medium-format camera that can shoot HD video.</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        The team behind<strong> </strong><em>Bounce: How the Ball Taught the World to Play </em>may not have taken the most conventional approach to making a documentary film but it seems to have paid off. <a href="http://www.davidmclain.com/">David McLain</a>, director of photography for <em>Bounce</em>, and <a href="http://cargocollective.com/mergegroup/filter/Jerome/Jerome-Thelia-Colorist">Jerome Thelia</a>, the film’s director, say that rather than sit around and wait for funding for the movie, they decided to shoot first and ask the bigger financial questions later. While that got the ball rolling on <em>Bounce</em>, it also meant a significant investment on their part.
        <p class="p1">“We put up $200,000 of our own money up front before we knew for sure we had a movie,” Thelia says. “While people advised us not to, it ended up being something we did absolutely right.”</p>
        <p class="p1">McLain and Thelia, who co-founded the production company Merge in 2003, may not have been sure they had a feature-length movie when they started, but they knew they had a good story. Based on a book by Harvard anthropologist John Fox titled <em>The Ball: Discovering the Object of the Game</em>, the movie traces the roots of play through ball- based sports. Like Fox’s book, <em>Bounce </em>hops around the world, from Brazilian <em>favelas </em>to Congolese villages, with McLain’s RED Epic camera quite literally following a bouncing ball from game to game.</p>
        <p class="p2"><strong>First Bounce</strong></p>
        <p class="p1">As in Fox’s book, the movie begins on the remote Orkney Islands off Scotland’s northern coast, where the ancient game of ba’ is still played. A sort of medieval precursor to modern-day soccer, ba’ is best described as (largely) non-violent “mob football,” where parts of a town fight to bring a ball to their respective sides. After shooting and editing footage of a ba’ game in the town of Kirkwall in Orkney, McLain and Thelia showed their dramatic video to a potential investor who not only loved the clip, but was impressed the pair had put up so much of their own money on the project.</p>
        <p class="p1">“We showed him that we were in it for the long haul,” Thelia says. “The fact that we were willing to put up our own collateral turned out to be a really good move.”</p>
        <p class="p1">With the long-term funding from the investor in place, the next step was picking locations, setting a shooting schedule and working on the extensive preproduction required. For McLain, who comes from a still-photography background but has worked in video for many years, the biggest challenge was to stop thinking like a one- man band and start envisioning the bigger picture. “What it’s taught me is that film is so insanely complicated and time consuming. When you watch a movie and there’s 500 people in the credits, it’s for a reason,” he says. “With still photography, it’s just you alone with a camera. With filmmaking, the authorship is shared in a way that’s difficult to get used to. It’s humbling.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Also joining the project was Thelia’s wife, Anne Carkeet, who is a producer on <em>Bounce </em>and oversees audio recording. One of the first decisions the three made was to hire a skilled video editor, because they knew that bringing the different segments from different locations together would be an important challenge. Also key was culling over 60 hours of footage (and counting) down to a 90-minute film. The man for the task, they decided, was Greg Wright, who had edited several documentaries previously. </p>
        <p class="p1">“The single biggest line item in our budget was for the editor because the film is only as good as the editor,” McLain says. “And Greg’s been amazing. He has the perfect disposition for an editor: non- emotional, in a good way. He’s like a judge.”</p>
        <p class="p2"><strong>Geared Up</strong></p>
        <p class="p1">Another big but unexpected investment was on storage space. With everything shot at 5K on the RED Epic, McLain has captured over 90 TB of data. They had budgeted $9,000 for hard drive space but spent over $20,000. Otherwise, however, gear costs have not been huge for the film. The Merge production company owns the RED Epic camera along with the Zeiss and Canon lenses McLain is using to shoot <em>Bounce</em>. His other main piece of gear is a Steadicam Zephyr camera stabilizer, which has replaced all the jibs and cranes he’s used in the past.</p>
        <p class="p1">“It’s a super stripped-down kit,” he says. “When cinematographers see it, they say: ‘I’ve never seen an Epic that looks that small.’ We’ve never had more than three checked bags [on the airplane] and that’s usually just personal stuff. We could lose all our luggage and still be able to shoot.”</p>
        <p class="p1">The relatively small gear load and barebones crew has allowed the <em>Bounce </em>team to cover a lot of ground while shooting. In addition to Orkney, Brazil and the Congo, they have traveled to Sinaloa, Mexico, where the 3,000-year-old sport of <em>ulama </em>helped first introduce the world to rubber via a nine-pound ball that’s hip-checked back and forth on a dusty court. They’ve shot video of dolphins playing with balls in Florida and captured footage of modern English soccer pitches. Oftentimes, a planned shoot will snowball into something else, such as when they filmed bonobo apes spinning soccer balls with their feet at a preserve in the Congo.</p>
        <p class="p1">“We didn’t know what to expect. We didn’t know if the bonobos had any interest in playing with a ball or playing with us,” Thelia says about the shoot, which had a challenging months-long permission process. Because of a badly translated request document, the French-speaking staff at the preserve mistakenly thought the <em>Bounce </em>crew wanted to throw balls at the apes. After everything was straightened out, the footage ended up being some of the most compelling in the film, helping to connect the roots of human play to a trait innate in animals.</p>
        <p class="p2"><strong>Following the Narrative  </strong></p>
        <p class="p1">Rather than shoot a voiceover, which Thelia viewed as too pedantic and too easy, they decided to make the narrative of the film be a variety of experts speaking. That proved challenging and time consuming but they’re happy with the results. McLain estimates he’ll shoot 65 interviews with experts on play, sports, psychology, animal behavior, art history and a variety of other fields. Those interviews will be edited and then interspersed throughout the video segments to create the narrative track.</p>
        <p class="p1">At the time of this story, <em>Bounce </em>was slated to have a completion date of summer 2014 and both McLain and Thelia seemed confident of meeting that goal. After the film is edited, their next step is to submit the documentary to top-tier film festivals, including Toronto, Berlin, Cannes, Sundance, Telluride and Tribeca. If it doesn’t get into those, there’s a second tier of festivals to apply to. “If you get into one of the top festivals, then a big part of your marketing is taken care of,” McLain notes.</p>
        <p class="p1">He adds that they will also create a 60-minute television version of <em>Bounce </em>with the hope that it might find a home on a TV cable network.</p>
        <p class="p1">“Creatively, this was a clear next place for me to go,” McLain says about making the transition from being a still photographer to shooting feature-length films. “At the same time, it’s been much more humbling than I expected. I’ve come out of it realizing not how much I know, but how much I don’t know. But that’s a good thing because, these days, you can’t just coast. You really need to be moving forward and evolving and this is such a cool way to do that.”</p>

        <p class="p1">Last year<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.jacobpritchard.com/">Jacob Pritchard</a> was one of three photographers hired by advertising agency mcgarrybowen to create social media content for Verizon Wireless. Pritchard was contracted to work for the brand for a year, shooting up to four times a week. His shoots ranged from piggybacking on a commercial production involving Verizon- sponsored IndyCar drivers, to photographing scenes that were conceived and produced much like print ads.</p>
        <p class="p4">Recently Pritchard interviewed one of the creative directors on the project, James Wood, who is now a group creative director at MRYin New York City. They spoke about the challenges brands face in creating social media content that engages consumers and the role of photography in branded social media communications.</p>
        <p class="p5"><span class="s2"><strong>Jacob Pritchard: </strong></span><strong>What do you see as the main challenge for brands that want to interact with consumers through social channels today?<br />
        </strong><span class="s3"><strong>James Wood: </strong></span>There are two key problems that brands face when they’re trying to create content in these channels. The first one is providing value. You’ve got to give somebody a reason to be a fan of your brand in the first place. I think all too often brands don’t really offer much other than throwing out some resized image assets from their other media channels.</p>
        <p class="p4">The other challenge is that when content starts showing up in your newsfeed, it has to be something that you even remotely pay attention to. The Facebook newsfeed is a very fluid, dynamic experience. You flip through your newsfeed the same way you flip through a magazine. So it’s sort of the age-old print medium problem of: How do you get somebody to stop flipping through the magazine long enough to take in your advertising message?</p>
        <p class="p4">Part of what we tried to do [on the Verizon project] was to create [content] that feels like it belongs in that newsfeed and can’t immediately be discounted as an ad. It feels like the piece of content that your brother or your co-worker just posted ... And on top of that, we wanted to create content that also had that kind of stopping power.</p>
        <p class="p4">Part of what brands struggle with is they take these things that are mocked-up comps that ... feel right as a banner ad or a TV spot or whatever. Then they stick it into a place where quite frankly it just doesn’t belong. It feels alien to the medium.</p>
        <p class="p4">So a brand has to say: OK, if we’re not just going to repurpose the advertising assets we already have, how do we cost effectively create something else? They turn to stock photography. Obviously there’s some stock that’s really great and there’s some stock that’s really awful. I do think you can approximate something that feels genuine and organic through stock, but you’re limited to what you can find that feels right.</p>
        <p class="p4">We experimented before [we hired you for the Verizon project] with just shooting stuff with phones. I felt that we were able to capture the moments that we were after, but certainly never were able to do it in a way that had the stopping power that we wanted to have. I certainly hope [social media content] continues to be a big part of what agencies can offer and what brands would be interested in buying. Relevant content is going to be more and more important in the years to come as people’s consumption habits get more and more fractured. Figuring out how to get the tenets of a brand into content is always going to be a valuable service.</p>
        <p class="p4"><span class="s3"><strong>JP: </strong></span><span class="s4"><strong>One thing that I’ve felt is a challenge for this kind of work, is that an audience is much quicker to cry foul or to call out a brand for a misstep. <br />
        </strong></span><span class="s3"><strong>JW: </strong></span>People are just waiting for brands to screw up social media. They’re just waiting for that errant Tweet to go out that says something insensitive, or for a brand to post something that maybe they didn’t realize was inappropriate for this reason or another reason.</p>
        <p class="p4">I think that’s created, unfortunately, a culture where [brands] are just terrified of putting anything out there that hasn’t been completely vetted and legally chopped up and down. It really cuts down on the amount of stuff you’re able to do that feels reactive ... There’s nothing you want to skip over in your timeline faster than something that feels like it’s from last week. You tend to stop on the things that feel like they’re happening now. Very rarely are you stopping on the photo from your friend who did something very cool last Tuesday. </p>
        <p class="p4">Going back to the audience being more critical about what brands post: I get it, because we’re crashing the party. It’s all the people who adopted Twitter or adopted Facebook, and they’re doing really great, amazing things ... then the advertisers and the agencies come in and try to figure out how to exploit it. I understand why there’s that desire to kick our ass when we mess it up and nothing makes people happier than to be able to say, “You don’t even really get this. Why are you bothering?”</p>
        <p class="p4">It’s always going to come down to who can leverage these things in a savvy-enough way that there’s appreciation for it. I do feel like appreciation is a big part of succeeding in this space, which is why effort is so important. The effort of sending you out to shoot something in a bespoke way, rather than just pulling a stock photo off Getty, hopefully signals to people that we take this channel seriously and we want to provide content with actual value that has been considered and thought through, and we’re not just doing the easiest thing we could possibly do which is: “Here’s our print ad resized on your newsfeed. Please buy our products.”</p>
        <p class="p4"><span class="s3"><strong>JP: </strong></span><span class="s4"><strong>Do you think that there’s a tendency for advertisers in the digital and social media space to be too focused on analytics and not enough on the actual content?<br />
        </strong></span><span class="s3"><strong>JW: </strong></span>There’s that brilliant video about [BUYRAL], the fake company that provides clicks. Basically they’re saying: What is the point in even measuring things by clicks or views or whatever when it’s always a fake number? What happened to judging something by whether it was truly entertaining and well-crafted and a great story and saying something poignant about the product or the brand or the consumer behavior?</p>
        <p>I feel like the work at the end of the day should always make people like the brand, make people want the products, make people want to have a relationship with that brand for the foreseeable future. Those things are all measurable, but very rarely are those things measured by views and click-throughs. I don’t know, in many ways it’s still a very infant space and it’s exciting, but you can also see the places that we’ve already run off the road a little bit. </p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[Hosting duties for major sporting events like the FIFA World Cup or the Olympic Games always come with a promise of economic stimulus and prestige. For the citizens of host nations, however, the honor of hosting a major international competition can be a poisoned chalice. Protests over lack of government services have erupted as Brazil spends heavily to prepare for the 2014 World Cup this summer. And Rio de Janeiro’s preparations for the 2016 Summer Olympic Games have fallen so far behind schedule that some are asking whether the event should be moved.
<p>Preparations for the World Cup and Olympic Games have also meant the forcible removal of thousands of people from their homes in Rio’s slums, also known as favelas. Often these removals come with little warning, and the homes are razed in an effort to alter the complexion of the city. Reading about the forcible removals struck a chord with <a href="http://marcleclef.net/">Marc Ohrem-Leclef</a>, a Brooklyn, New York-based commercial and fine-art photographer. Ohrem-Leclef had traveled to Rio several times to shoot commercial jobs and felt an affinity for the city. In 2012 he set out to create a body of work about the people whose lives have been upended by these mega-sports events.</p>
<p>Through street portraits made in 13 favelas across Rio, Ohrem-Leclef’s new book, <a href="http://marcleclef.net/index.php?/projects/olympic-rio---vai-com-deus/"><em>Olympic Favela</em></a>, released this month by Damiani, tells the “David and Goliath” story of the people whose homes have been destroyed or threatened by Rio’s housing authority.</p>
<p>“I wanted to create this portrait of the people who live there from a very human perspective,” Ohrem-Leclef says. From his previous experiences in Rio, he felt there was “a stigma attached to people living in the favelas,” which he was interested in breaking down. For access and introductions to the people affected, Ohrem-Leclef worked with a small, local NGO called <a href="http://catcomm.org/">Catalytic Communities</a>.</p>
<p>The help of a local assistant was important, he says. “I needed somebody who was sensitive and knew how to explain [the project] to people who are very insecure and unsettled,” Ohrem-Leclef explains. Seeing his medium-format film camera, some residents worried he was working for the city government. He would joke with them: “If I [was working for] the city I would come with a little digital camera, not this monster.”</p>
<p>Some people took a couple of hours of convincing. “These people are really worried about being too visible for fear of repercussions from the city government,” Ohrem- Leclef says. But most everyone chose to work with him.</p>
<p>Ohrem-Leclef’s color photographs show men, women and children in the narrow lanes of favelas. The images are full of character and atmosphere. Two boys pose on the limbs of a tree; a couple embrace outside their home, a dog standing on the roof behind them is caught mid-bark; three generations of one family sit together on a concrete bench, Rio’s lush green hills stretching out in the distance. Architectural details and street scenes add to the sense of place.</p>
<p>Interspersed throughout the book are images of favela residents holding red torches up in the air. Ohrem-Le- clef created these images as symbols of empowerment. He came up with the strategy after researching imagery related to certain keywords on <a href="http://www.imageatlas.org/">Image Atlas</a>, the art and programming project created by photographer Taryn Simon and the deceased Internet activist Aaron Swartz. Image Atlas, which allows users to sort image results by geographical location and gross domestic product, enabled Ohrem-Leclef to research local image results for keywords like eviction, liberty, strength, unification, displacement and other related terms. A common theme emerged of a “gesture of a raised hand, whether it’s carrying a flag or torch or weapon,” Ohrem-Leclef says.</p>
<p>While it was “nerve-wracking” to be in the streets of favelas lighting maritime emergency torches, which he purchased at a high price, Ohrem-Leclef says people understood and appreciated the symbolism. In fact, he says, they understood the idea better than anyone else he tried to explain it to. The resulting images draw on the symbolism of the Olympic torch, and on the common practice of lighting torches in the stands at soccer matches, something that happens throughout the world. They also signify the sense of emergency felt by favela residents.</p>
<p>On the title page of <em>Olympic Favela</em>, which includes essays by local leaders about the history and present challenges faced by favela residents, Ohrem-Leclef thanks “the many generous people I have met on the hills and in the flatlands of Rio de Janeiro, for showing me the heart and soul of their city.” Despite their reputation as dangerous places, Ohrem-Leclef says that he felt welcome and safe in the favelas. “My experience in general is, when you go to these quote-unquote dangerous places and you go with a very open and positive attitude, it usually flips the script.” He felt most uneasy, he says, when the military police were present.</p>
<p>Ohrem-Leclef hopes that the book, which is being distributed in Brazil, will “enhance the conversation” around the favelas in a last- ing way. In addition to the book, Ohrem-Leclef has made his images available to Catalytic Communities and other NGOs, and he is working on raising funds for an exhibition that will travel throughout the favelas and “further the conversation locally.”</p>]]></article_text>

        Fashion and celebrity photographer <a href="http://www.jamiemagnifico.com/">Jamie Magnifico</a> had a single-minded goal when he moved from Vermont to New York City in 2009. “I was interested in [becoming a photographer] as fast I could,” he says. “I definitely had no intention to assist [full- time]. I didn’t want to be anybody’s anything. You get stuck in a rut. You get comfortable.”
        <p>To learn as much about technique and lighting as he could, Magnifico worked as a freelance photographer’s assistant. But he also worked as a freelance production assistant to learn how to manage productions and run a business. Within three years, he started landing assignments to shoot celebrities for <em>Essence</em> magazine, and fashion campaigns for designer Brett Johnson.</p>
        <p>Magnifco says relationship building was essential to his transition. He also shoots personal work constantly, and has developed a thick-skinned self-confidence.<br />
        <br />
        “There’s a lot of attitude,” especially in fashion photography, he says. “You’re going to get so many negative things thrown at you. But I don’t care. I don’t care! Just be proud of what you do.”</p>
        <p>Growing up in southern Vermont, Magnifico learned small business basics, including the importance of customer relationships, by working at his father’s deli. His mother managed a hair salon next door. “That’s how I got into fashion, looking through all the magazines” in the hair salon, he says.</p>
        <p>While attending Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, he worked as an assistant at <a href="http://palmerkane.photoshelter.com/">Palmer Kane Studio</a> in Pownal, Vermont.</p>
        <p>“He could do everything. He was a terrific stylist. He could charm the pants off customers,” says Gabe Palmer. But Palmer and his wife, Pat Kane, eventually encouraged Magnifico to expand his horizons.</p>
        <p>Magnifico says it didn’t take much prodding for him to relocate to New York City, where he quickly landed an internship at <a href="http://www.milkstudios.com/">Milk Studios</a> “to figure out how everything worked” in the fashion business, he explains. From the start he tried to get noticed. He remembered details about people, like how much sugar they liked in their coffee. He jumped in whenever he noticed someone needed help.</p>
        <p>It made people willing to help him when he asked questions, he says. For instance, he’d show someone a photograph and ask how they would reproduce the lighting.</p>
        <p>“Then you ask someone else, and when you have the basic idea, you do it yourself.”<br />
        <br />
        The connections also led to paid assisting work. Magnifico says he tried to work with many different photographers, to avoid learning only one way of doing things. From Mark Abrahams, he says, “I learned how to do Rembrandt sort of lighting, basically starting from the basics” of studio lighting.</p>
        <p>Another photographer he worked for was Yu Tsai, both as a photographer’s assistant and a production assistant. Yu Tsai was shooting a job for <em>Essence</em> magazine at Milk Studios when Magnifico first met him. “We started chitchatting and kept in touch,” Magnifico says.</p>
        <p>Yu Tsai eventually introduced him to Tracy Gosein, co-owner of Brooklyn, New York-based Matador Productions, who also hired Magnifico as a production assistant.</p>
        <p>The production experience taught him how to pitch, estimate, and produce jobs, and how to talk to clients, he says. “Photographers talk [about] how to see, how to move. That’s what they do, but at end of day, you still need to make money.”</p>
        <p>Magnifico kept notes of every production and every shoot he worked on. “I would write down: this is how they lit this, this is how they did that.” He noted all the crew required for each shoot, and wrote down the production timeline. “I was learning: How [to] organize a particular shoot, [and] figuring out what you need and don’t need.”</p>
        <p>In his spare time, he was constantly shooting tests to build his portfolio. They were bootstrap productions that Magnifico funded with money he earned as an assistant, and from waiting tables.</p>
        <p>“You have to be smart. You beg and you borrow: equipment, cameras, lights,” he says. “You do a lot of natural-light stuff at first. Then I bought an AlienBees head—just one head—that’s all I could afford.”</p>
        <p>At first, Magnifico worked with models he met through Models.com. “They’d show up and you’d be, ‘Really? You’re the model?’ But you’ve got to work with what you’ve got.”</p>
        <p>He photographed mostly men, because they required smaller crews. Magnifico explains that he couldn’t afford hair and makeup stylists, and didn’t want to ask female models to do the styling themselves. Also, male models were more willing to provide their own transportation to out-of- the-way locations.</p>
        <p>As his photography skills improved, he asked Yu Tsai to introduce him to modeling agencies. Yu Tsai took him to meetings with booking agents at Ford Models, DNA Model Management and Wilhelmina. Magnifico got his first test shoot with DNA. “They hated [the work I sent] and didn’t use it. But it’s try, try, try again,” Magnifico says.</p>
        <p>To help improve his skills, he solicited critiques wherever he could, asking people to look at just one or two images, not his entire portfolio. His goal was to get people to point to just one or two things they would have done better.</p>
        <p>The criticism was often blunt and hard to take, he says, but it helped him far more than any praise. “I’d rather people tell me, ‘That looks like shit.’ Then I can say, ‘Tell me why. If this is shit, how do I make it better?’”</p>
        <p>Shooting for modeling agencies also helped him build the portfolio he needed to get paying jobs from editorial clients. “I could show my work and say, ‘This was for DNA, this was for Wilhelmina.’ That’s really important” in getting editors’ attention, he explains.</p>
        <p>Magnifico says he asked producers he was working with to introduce him to photo editors. Once again, it was personal relationships that opened doors. His first editorial job landed in his lap when he was working as a second shooter for Marc Baptiste on a fashion story for <em>Essence</em> magazine. Baptiste had been scheduled to shoot the magazine’s style page, too, but a logistical conflict arose, according to Magnifico. “And they were like, ‘OK, Jamie will shoot it.’”</p>
        <p>That led to steady work for <em>Essence</em>, including shoots for the magazine’s “Most Eligible Bachelors” feature in 2012. One of those subjects was fashion designer Brett Johnson. “We hit it off,” Magnifico says, and Johnson hired him to shoot an ad campaign.</p>
        <p>At press time Magnifico was preparing to shoot a second campaign for Johnson.<br />
        <br />
        Magnifico continues to assist, but only to help out photographers who have helped him get his career off the ground. “It’s a loyalty thing,” he says. “I assist here and there, but I’m going towards my own [assignment work] right now.”</p>
        <p>The challenge now is to get more photographs of female models in his portfolio, so he continues to do a lot of test shooting between assignments. “I’m shooting more women so I don’t get pigeonholed. I could do men’s fashion, but at the end of the day, I want to shoot the girls. That’s where the money is.”</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[If there’s a silver lining to all the turmoil in the publishing business, it is the freedom—even imperative—of photojournalists to experiment with the conventions of narrative, voice and audience engagement. The Instagram-based project called <a href="http://instagram.com/everydayafrica">Everyday Africa</a> is a notable example of creativity borne of business disruption.
<p>Launched in 2012 by photographer <a href="http://www.peterdicampo.com/">Peter DiCampo</a> and writer Austin Merrill, the project is a growing collection of images by about 20 contributing photographers that show the continent outside the usual media frame of exploitation, war, poverty and disease.</p>
<p>“The goal is very much to change the perceptions of Africa,” DiCampo says. “We want people to understand that [the Western media’s depictions] are only a small part of the truth.</p>
<p>“To me, it’s all about looking at the notion of [traditional] photojournalism and sort of trying to poke holes in it a little bit,” he adds.</p>
<p>He and Merrill seem to be on to something: Everyday Africa has spurred imitators in Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere. They’ve won grants to use Everyday Africa as a springboard for a pilot program to teach eighth graders in New York City about media stereotypes and visual literacy. Other initiatives stemming from the project are in the works.</p>
<p>It all began when DiCampo and Merrill were in West Africa on a grant from the <a href="http://pulitzercenter.org/">Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting</a> to do a story about the aftermath of the civil war in Ivory Coast, which ended in 2011. The two journalists had proposed telling a conventional story from the perspective of refugees.</p>
<p>“Then of course, you’re looking for all these different images and sources that tell that story, and you tend to pre-edit all this other stuff that you’re seeing,” DiCampo explains. “To us it became important to tell a more complete story [that] mirrored how we knew daily life functions on the continent.”</p>
<p>DiCampo found himself telling the story he’d pitched with “my quote-unquote professional camera” while shooting more personal and spontaneous pictures of everyday life on the streets with an iPhone.</p>
<p>He and Merrill finished the Ivory Coast story, but kept their daily-life project going while working on subsequent assignments, and they were looking for ways to share it. They knew mainstream media wouldn’t be interested because it didn’t fit the mold of stories about Africa.</p>
<p>“The news media is by its very nature so story-based,” and biased toward negative stories about Africa, DiCampo explains. “But our project is even more strange because it’s sort of a project about nothing. It’s just a collection of daily life images for the most part.”</p>
<p>They started <a href="http://everydayafrica.tumblr.com/">a Tumblr</a> to distribute the images themselves, and soon afterwards, launched the project on Instagram, too. “From there we launched into getting other photographers involved [as contributors] who are experiencing the same frustrations” over the stereotypical coverage of Africa.</p>
<p>DiCampo invited photographers whose work he respects and who “understand the project in a deep way, and are either African, or have lived there for significant amounts of time,” he says.</p>
<p>He gives them little direction. “Nothing’s off limits,” he says. “I love it when it’s this behind-the-scenes thing, where you’re kind of going about shooting this crisis story but showing everything else that happens along the way.”</p>
<p>Initially, he sent a monthly newsletter about Everyday Africa to magazine and newspaper editors. That led to stories about the project on Salon.com, The New York Times Lens blog, National Geographic and other online publications.</p>
<p>Everyday Africa was also featured twice on Instagram’s suggested user list, which dramatically boosted the number of followers. At press time, the total was approaching 90,000.</p>
<p>“We realized that our primary audience on Instagram is young people who are learning about the world,” DiCampo says. He and Merrill saw this as an opportunity to help shape perceptions of Africa in audiences still forming ideas about it, “so we kind of went into education from there.”</p>
<p>In partnership with The LAMP, a nonprofit media education organization in New York City, DiCampo and Merrill won an Open Society Foundations Audience Engagement Grant to develop and <a href="http://www.thelampnyc.org/2014/04/15/everyday-bronx-program-uses-photography-for-visual-literacy-empowerment/">launch an eight-week course</a> for eighth graders that meets once a week at the Bronx Documentary Center. (The program is also supported by a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.)</p>
<p>The students will “compare our photos to news photos and talk about where preconceived notions come from,” DiCampo explains. The students will also discuss news coverage in their own communities.</p>
<p>“Then they’re going to get some practical photography lessons and they’re going to go out and start telling stories in their communities. And all of that will go onto an Everyday Bronx feed,” he explains.</p>
<p>DiCampo hopes to replicate and expand the program in other cities. At the same time, he and Merrill are using some of the grant money to build a website that expands community participation in the Everyday Africa project. Camera phones are ubiquitous in Africa, and people are already creating their own visual narratives from multiple perspectives, DiCampo says. “There’s just no place to share it. So the website will display not only our photos, but everything that’s hashtagged with Everyday Africa.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he’s exploring other ways to leverage the popularity of the project. Now that other Instagram users are launching similar projects in other parts of the world, DiCampo envisions a traveling exhibition that “[takes] all these ‘Everydays’ of Instagram photos to create something global in scale.”</p>
<p>He’s also started work on an Everyday Africa book, culling the comments and conversations of the project’s Instagram followers for the text. “Any book would have to bring in the dialogue we create,” he says.</p>
<p>DiCampo realizes those projects require money, and perhaps a lot of it. As popular as the project is on social media, and as promising as it seems as a foundation for visual literacy education, Everyday Africa is still largely a bootstrap project running on volunteer labor.</p>
<p>“There are all these questions about how you monetize Instagram,” DiCampo says. “Do you put ads on your feed? Do corporate-sponsored jobs?”</p>
<p>A big challenge is finding ways to sustain the project and its various initiatives without compromising the project’s principles and credibility, DiCampo says. Not that he’s complaining. After all, a project he and Merrill began with a Tumblr feed to share a few personal pictures that challenge the conventional view of Africa has already succeeded beyond all their expectations.</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<a href="http://toshbrown.com/">Tosh Brown</a> of Austin, Texas, has specialized in fishing, hunting and wildlife photography since 1999. His clients include Bass Pro Shops, <em>Field &amp; Stream</em>, <em>The Flyfish Journal</em>, L.L.Bean, <em>Outdoor Life</em>, Patagonia, Sportsman Channel, and other advertisers and publishers.
<p><strong>PDN: How did you get into hunting and fishing photography?</strong><br />
Tosh Brown: I owned a sporting travel agency back in the<br />
1990s that booked hunting and fishing trips around the world. I could never afford to hire a photographer in those days so I always had a camera around my neck to capture images for brochures and promotion. When the Internet came along and killed the travel industry, I closed my agency and began submitting the slides I had accumulated to various hunting and fishing magazines and companies.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: What’s most appealing about the work?</strong><br />
TB: It’s never boring. I’ve been able to visit some amazing destinations around the world—the Amazon, Africa, South America—and the settings, species and action that I shoot are always changing.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: What makes a good hunting image? Or a good fishing image? What’s your goal, creatively speaking, when you shoot?</strong><br />
TB: I work hard to get the shots that capture the peak of the action: a flushing pheasant with a dog on point and a hunter mounting his gun. A fly fisherman attached to a jumping tarpon … Those are the images that make people stop and look.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: What percentage of your total business does this niche account for?</strong><br />
TB: Ninety percent. [The rest is] travel, landscape and the occasional food shot.</p>
<p><strong>PDN:  What’s the market? And how do clients use your images?</strong><br />
TB: About 70 percent of my work is stock image sales to outdoor magazines, books, ad agencies and companies that manufacture outdoor products. The remainder is a mix of editorial, commercial and private assignment work.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: How has the market changed since you started?</strong><br />
TB: Like most photography markets, digital has opened the floodgates and added a lot of imagery into the hunting and fishing markets. Pricing for our work is at historic lows, but uniquely crafted images can still be sold for a decent rate.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: How do you promote yourself?</strong><br />
TB: I’m constantly researching outdoor companies and publishers and reaching out to their editors and art directors, usually by e-mail with links to my online portfolios. For social media, I post links to my latest blog posts on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: Describe a typical assignment.</strong><br />
TB: On the editorial side, it’s typically a quick one- or two-day shoot where I’m sent to cover a specific locale, personality or hunting/fishing activity. I’m typically working alone on those shoots. Commercial shoots are typically the same duration but much more frenetic with ad agency folk and art directors scurrying about. The commercial shoots often have video production happening alongside my still shots.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: What are some examples of recent assignments?</strong><br />
TB: I did a dove hunting photo shoot for <em>Outdoor Life</em> magazine. Opening day is typically as much of a social event as it is a hunting experience. They asked me to capture the essence of the hunting, families, settings and camaraderie that surround opening day of dove season. Last week I did a private shoot for an exclusive  duck hunting club in Arkansas. My services were a gift from one of their hunters who visits each year. In a couple of weeks I’ll deliver a custom hardbound coffee table book to each of the members.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: What are the biggest challenges of this kind of photography?</strong><br />
TB: Weather, weather and weather. Sometimes the birds don’t fly and the fish don’t bite even in perfect conditions, but it’s most often adverse weather that hampers a shoot. Rain, clouds and wind are generally bad for fishing photography. Bright sun and heat are generally bad for hunting.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: How do you handle those weather challenges?</strong><br />
TB: Occasionally it’s a complete bust and the shoot has to be scrapped or rescheduled. Typically, though, I can get the material I need by putting cameras in housings, tacking on an extra day or two, or supplementing with generic images from my stock archive as a last resort.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: What gear do you use?</strong><br />
TB: I’m a minimalist because my work often requires boats, wading, small planes, climbing, horses and other rickety means of transportation. My go-to box has two Nikon D4 bodies, a 17-35mm zoom, a 14mm fisheye, a 60mm macro, an 80-400mm zoom, two strobes, reflectors, clamps and remote triggers. The bonus box is my Aquatica underwater housing, a mask, snorkel and flippers.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: What are your rates for assignments?</strong><br />
TB: I’d rather not divulge [my numbers], but assignment rates are all over the scale. I’ve seen them as low as $200 per day for editorial and as high as $5,000 per day for commercial. Emerging photographers need to determine their cost of doing business and then set their assignment rates to cover those costs and ultimately make a profit.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: What’s your advice for photographers trying to get into this niche?</strong><br />
TB: Learn to market yourself; great images will not sell themselves in a crowded market. Learn the business side of photography and don’t give your work away. Don’t go overboard with gear. In the end, the camera will have very little to do with your success or failure.<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <a href="http://jr-brown.com/">Jeff Brown</a> is interested in the craft of making photos—both his own, and those of other photographers he admires. Brown, who often mixes multiple tungsten lights and strobes in his off-kilter portraits and still lifes (see <a href="/The-Pros-and-Cons-of-10834.shtml">The Pros and Cons of Continuous Lights</a>), says that when he first went to Parsons the New School for Design to study photography, he wanted to work in the darkroom. “I was into printing. I loved making one big print and getting a friend to help dodge and burn it,” he says. As he moved into digital capture, he became interested in studio photography. “Lighting is fun because you know what you’re making.” 
        <p class="p1">He has been inspired by many photographers, and has been voracious in looking at a variety of editorial work since he was a student. “I enjoy technique a lot and it’s fun to figure out how somebody did something,” he says. “My main sources of inspiration were Blommers/Schumm and Nadav Kander. What I like about them is that their style is pretty uniquely their own, no matter what the project.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Like portrait and advertising photographer Nadav Kander, the Dutch duo of <a href="http://blommers-schumm.com/">Anuschka Blommers and Niels Schumm</a> have shot a range of work, both for themselves and for clients. After graduating from Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam, they began working together in 1998. That same year, their work was shown at Stedelijk Museum Bureau Amsterdam. They have also had solo exhibitions at the Foam museum in Amsterdam, the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, and other institutions and galleries. From the beginning of their careers, they have shot fashion and portraiture, bringing a sardonic vision to the conventions of fashion photography in their work for magazines such as <em>Self Service</em>, <em>Purple</em>, <em>AnOther Magazine</em>, <em>i-D</em>, <em>The New York Times Magazine</em>, <em>The Gentlewoman</em> and <em>Interview</em>. </p>
        <p class="p1">“Their influence on me had to do with the lighting, for sure,” Brown says, but he is equally intrigued by their approach to photographing people. “Each subject becomes its own character through their eyes. And all their photos are very still. Even if there is an action, you can feel how still it is.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Their images are peculiar, he says, and that’s made them linger in his mind since he first discovered the duo’s work as an art student. “I like when you have to give something a second look,” says Brown. “I think they’re fantastic and just as distinctive today as when I first saw the work.”</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[It’s a delicate task to refresh a brand that has more than 100 years of history and generations of customer loyalty. Companies that last that long are few and far between, and no matter what they produce or sell, their longevity is likely based on the quality and consistency of their products rather than chasing trends.
<p>Pacific Northwest outdoor clothing and gear manufacturer <a href="http://www.filson.com/">Filson</a> is just such a company. Founded in 1897 by Clinton C. Filson to outfit men headed to the Yukon during the Klondike Gold Rush, the company has created goods for folks who work—and, more recently, those who play—outdoors in harsh conditions. Filson has a legacy of quality and durability, and many of its oldest garment designs are still manufactured in Seattle and offered to customers today.</p>
<p>The story and history of the brand are major assets, as is the community of people who wear and use Filson products for hunting, fishing or outdoor work. So when creative director Stephen Zhang joined the company in July 2013, the goal was to update the look of the brand while staying true to the history and the values of the core customer. “What we wanted to do was to visually communicate the story of the brand and the essence of the brand to the customers,” Zhang tells <em>PDN</em> during a video interview from the Dallas headquarters of Bedrock Manufacturing Co., the private equity and brand management company that acquired C.C. Filson, Inc. in June 2012. (The company also owns the brand Shinola, a manufacturer of American-made watches, bicycles and accessories based in Detroit.)</p>
<p>Documentary-style storytelling, both through still photographs and video, is one of the keys to Filson’s updated communications efforts. The stories the brand tells in its catalogue and on the website are authentic. They come from members of the Filson community. The brand “will never use models” for its shoots, Zhang says, only actual customers. Passion for the outdoors is growing, Zhang points out, and that passion is deeply felt by those who pursue outdoor activities or work. Part of the goal of Filson’s storytelling is to “understand that emotion and to try to represent and portray that heart and feeling.”</p>
<p>Prior to joining Filson, Zhang spent 19 years as the image director for Fossil, the watch and accessory brand founded by Tom Kartsotis, who owns Bedrock Manufacturing Co. At Fossil, Zhang primarily worked with fashion photographers. It’s “very refreshing,” he says, to work for a brand that creates products that are functional—not just fashionable.</p>
<p>It makes sense for Filson, Zhang says, to work with photographers and filmmakers who are part of the Filson community and who engage in the outdoor pursuits they portray for the brand. “Our approach is a little bit like crowd sourcing,” Zhang explains. “Filson’s unique situation is that we have a good, healthy community, and many of them are photographers or outdoors people or writers or videographers.” Zhang says the photographers Filson works with, in addition to being outdoors people, “also need to be storytellers, because they understand the nuances of the sports so they can tell the story more authentically.”</p>
<p>For Filson’s 2014 Spring Sourcebook, Zhang’s first catalogue as creative director, they updated the design, giving more space to the products. “You look at this catalogue versus October last year, it’s kind of night and day,” Zhang says. “It used to be like a SkyMall [catalogue] and the pages were stuffed with little pictures. What we wanted to do was give the products and brand some space so that people actually can appreciate [them]. So we lowered the density and we created the storytelling, which the brand has done on and off, but not in a deliberate way.”</p>
<p>For the stories featured in the Sourcebook the brand worked with <a href="http://www.finbackfilms.com/">Finback Films</a>, a creative agency that produces documentary films and stills. One of the stories is about the Filson factory in Seattle, and three others feature Filson customers: Kerry Burkheimer, a fly fisherman and maker of one-of-a-kind fishing rods; Ed Zevely, a Colorado man who seeks solitude by camping in the Colorado high country; and the founders of Westland Distillery, who also happen to be sport shooters. For each of the stories the Finback Films crew produced both a short video for the Filson website, and stills for the Sourcebook.</p>
<p>The Finback Films team of Alex Jablonski, Khalil Hudson and Tyler Hughen first connected with Filson when they were working on Low &amp; Clear, a fly-fishing documentary they released in 2012. After seeing a trailer for the film, a member of the Filson team reached out to the filmmakers to discuss a partnership, and Filson became a sponsor of the film. All three are longtime Filson customers, Jablonski says.</p>
<p>When the Finback team decided to become a creative agency and explore branded documentary-style work, their first pitch was to Filson. They wanted to tell the story of Ed Zevely, a 68-year-old Colorado man (who also happens to be Hughen’s stepfather), who journeys into the Colorado high country every few months with his horses and dog to camp for weeks and find a sense of solitude. The six-minute video, which was shot with a RED Epic camera, is featured on the Filson site, and was recently named a Vimeo Staff Pick.</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/86651195">Open Door to Solitude</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/filson">Filson</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to shooting the motion footage, Hudson also shot medium-format stills while they were creating the video about Zevely. Shooting film was a personal decision, Hudson says, but Filson loved the esthetic and asked for film work on the subsequent shoots Finback did for the brand. “[It] seemed like the texture and the richness of film was going to be able to communicate [the timelessness of the brand] in a really subtle way,” Jablonski says, “and much to Filson’s credit they just said, ‘Go for it,’ and were really happy with the images that came back.”</p>
<p>Jablonski and Hudson describe Zhang as a “quiet presence” on set, who let them do their thing. Hudson recalls that during location scouting for the story on fly fisherman Kerry Burkheimer, Zhang recognized that there “might be a cover shot” on a certain section of the Columbia River they were scouting during a drizzly day. “It looked nothing like how the photograph came out, and sure enough that’s what ended up on the cover.”</p>
<p>Shooting in a documentary style has its ups and downs, Jablonski says. “The upside is you’re going to get some really authentic material that will have a feeling of honesty that you’re not going to get if it’s staged.” The challenge is that you’re not working with models or scripts. Zhang was very good, Jablonski says, at keeping the Finback crew focused on the central idea of a story while “letting the approach be fluid.”</p>
<p>Zhang admits that Filson is still fundamentally a small company with limited budgets at this point, but Jablonski says Filson “absolutely gave us the resources to do the job and do it well.”</p>
<p>“We’re becoming more national, but we’re relatively small still,” says Susan Towers, Filson’s director of communications. “We’re not going to be working with Bruce Weber anytime soon.”</p>
<p>Towers’s small team includes Social Media Specialist Travis Gillett, who hires photographers for the <a href="http://www.filson.com/filson-life/">Filson Life</a> blog on the company’s site, where the brand features more stories from its community, and for its Instagram feed. Filson Life recently featured a duck hunting story by <a href="http://kjphotos.com/">Kyle Johnson</a>; <a href="http://farhadsamari.com/">Farhad Samari</a>’s story on winter camping in the Sierra Nevada mountains; and a story about a couple who work as wooden boat builders, which was photographed by <a href="http://cargocollective.com/eleanorlonardo">Eleanor Lonardo</a>.</p>
<p>While creatively Filson is open to new approaches, Zhang is working on a style guide for the filmmakers and photographers that the brand works with, and one of the pillars is the use of natural light. “We want to work with people who use existing light,” Zhang says.</p>
<p>The brand is in the process of adding a New York City store to its existing Seattle, Portland, Oregon, London and Aspen, Colorado, locations. “There are two big groups of [Filson] customers,” Zhang says. One group is comprised of people who work or recreate outdoors, and the other is made up of urban customers who appreciate the ruggedness and functionality of Filson products. But the brand remains focused on “speaking to our core,” who buy the products for outdoor use.</p>
<p>As the company continues to refresh and improve the quality of its communications and visual storytelling, it does so with its core customers in mind. “The community owns the brand and history owns the brand,” Zhang says. “So there are no egos involved.”</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[What motivates people to live where they do? And when living is tough, what motivates them to stay? For the cowboys and miners depicted in <a href="http://lucasfoglia.com/">Lucas Foglia</a>’s <em>Frontcountry</em>, a monograph recently published by Nazraeli Press that explores sparsely populated areas of Wyoming, Nevada, Texas, Montana and Idaho, the mythology of the cowboy lifestyle is at least part of the draw. That mythology persists despite the difficulty of actually carving out an existence through agriculture.
<p>Foglia first traveled in Wyoming with a reporter friend in 2006 as he was finishing his first book, A Natural Order, which depicted communities of people living off the grid in the Southeastern United States. He was looking for a new project at the time and the images of the American West “stuck in my head,” he says. “The communities I visited felt smaller and the land bigger and harsher, more remote, than anything I’d seen or experienced before.”</p>
<p>The landscape drew him in, as did the people who chose to live in it. In the areas and communities in which Foglia traveled and created this work, the people he met were “either cowboys or they were working for mines,” he says. “That idea that this wild, harsh landscape supported two very different lifestyles, and the fact that both lifestyles extract from that landscape, brought me back to photograph.”</p>
<p>In Foglia’s images we see ranchers and their children mostly at work, training horses or herding cattle or hunting coyotes. There are glimpses of county fairs, school sports, church gatherings and other community activities. Most often the images depict lone figures in vast landscapes. Photographs of mining workers and the small towns built up to serve them evoke a similar sense of isolation.</p>
<p>Landscapes and detail photographs establish the context. We see a loan office interior, with its wood paneling and two green chairs for hopeful applicants, or a saloon’s back porch, next to which is a massive pile of empties in black bags. We see gold mines, a natural gas field, a power plant spewing a thick plume of smoke over a vast, snow-covered landscape.</p>
<p>Foglia met the people he photographed through referrals, gaining their trust because he “was introduced to them by someone they trusted,” he says. “On my first trip to Wyoming I met a cattle rancher in Star Valley and he asked me to go to church with him. I’m a Jewish agnostic from New York, but I went to church and I met a whole community through him,” he recalls. The isolation people live in means “they also live in very close communities. As a stranger it’s very hard to be welcomed in, but if you know somebody you can meet the whole town.”</p>
<p>Foglia funded the work through a combination of print sales, licensing and occasional magazine assignments. “The photographs that I make for my books are shown in galleries or institutions, hung on the walls of the people I photograph, published as magazine stories and used by organizations for advocacy.”</p>
<p>Just as the network of people he photographed for Frontcountry grew socially, so have his career opportunities, he says. While at Houston Fotofest in 2008, for instance, he took a group of people to a Texas line dance at a bar he knew of. One of those people was Mark Sink, a curator from Denver. They stayed in touch and Sink eventually invited him to show his photographs at the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver. “The solo show at the MCA happened, in part, because we went dancing,” Foglia explains. “My whole world works that way.” Similarly, a friend introduced him to Tara Guertin at AFAR magazine. Guertin later called him for an assignment in Silverton, Texas, and three photographs from that shoot are in the book.</p>
<p>The only text in Frontcountry is a monologue by Olan Clifford Teel, a cowboy in Wells, Nevada. “People who grew up here helped their parents ranch,” he says. “They know what it feels like to feed cattle when it’s 30 [degrees] below zero. They know that life, and many don’t want it.” Living in town and working for the mines is easier, Teel says. Yet when the mining company moves on, “The miners leave and then the other jobs leave, too. The land is scarred and the town is scarred.”</p>
<p>Foglia grew up on a farm, and while he doesn’t want his images to “idealize agriculture,” he says, “I do think that farming and ranching, if done well, can be sustainable.” But, he adds, “It’s hard for ranching communities to have enough income to pay for new roads” and sustain a town in a remote area. Communities that thrive do so because of the mining industry, which has a lifecycle. “Every mine goes bust eventually,” Foglia notes. What will happen to these communities when the mines are tapped out seems inevitable: Ghost towns are another fixture of Western mythology.</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        When surfing, skating and streetwear clothing brand St&uuml;ssy recently released a kid’s collection emblazoned with Looney Tunes cartoon characters, <a href="http://www.shaniqwajarvis.com/">Shaniqwa Jarvis</a> got a call to photograph kids wearing the clothes for the company’s website and a social media campaign. She had planned a studio shoot, but then decided to photograph kids wearing the clothes in their own homes, as she’s done for several other campaigns inspired by her signature personal project called “This Charming Man.”
        <p class="p2">“It became ‘This Charming Kid,’” she says of the St&uuml;ssy x Looney Tunes shoot. </p>
        <p class="p2">The numerous assignments she’s shot in the style of “This Charming Man” have been mostly for clothing and shoe retailers, and they usually feature 20- and 30-something guys with self-possession, personal style and a bit of mystery. But she sees a potential to reach a broader range of clients.</p>
        <p class="p2">“Companies want this look and feel and styling,” says Jarvis, noting that many brands are trying to art direct a look she’s figured out how to create naturally. </p>
        <p class="p2">It all began when she was trying to start her career in London, where she relocated from Los Angeles in 2008 after a difficult breakup. A London agent who looked at her portfolio suggested she photograph the people around her. The advice struck Jarvis as hackneyed and “ridiculous,” she says. “But I took her advice to shoot something personal to me.” </p>
        <p class="p2">She came up with the idea to approach intriguing men in public, and ask to photograph them in their homes. “I was working out my issues with dudes,” she says. She also wanted to improve her portraiture skills. “I thought: I’ll do this, it’s practice.”</p>
        <p class="p2">The men she approached had caught her attention with their dress and demeanor. Some had a blustery confidence. Others were shy. Jarvis was curious about what was behind the facades. “I would say, ‘Hey, I’m working on this project, taking portraits of guys.’ And most of them said ‘Yes’ straight off.”</p>
        <p class="p2">She arranged to come around to their houses, instructing them to wear any outfit they wanted. “I said, ‘This is going to be like a day in the life of you.’” She made no wardrobe or styling suggestions. </p>
        <p class="p2">“With every single guy, it was a conversation,” she says. We talked about everything, from the way they were raised, to what they expected to happen in life, to what girls they were hooking up with.” Sometimes she spent all day, other times just a few hours, shooting with available light and on-camera flash.</p>
        <p class="p2">“I got genuine moments out of these guys,” she says. “I learned through shooting this project that people are going to give you what you want when you ease them in: conversing, sharing stuff about myself, having a good time.”</p>
        <p class="p2">In 2010, when Jarvis was more than two years into the project, a friend encouraged her to “do something with it.” Around that time, she attended a photo exhibition at the Londonewcastle Project Space, and decided to exhibit her own work there. “My friends said, ‘You’re dreaming.’”</p>
        <p class="p2">But Jarvis sent in a proposal, “and the guys in charge said, ‘OK, you have the space for two weeks.’” Without money or expertise to mount an exhibition, she started calling friends for help. One helped her curate the show. Others with PR expertise and media connections helped her promote it. Still others helped her frame the prints and design the show catalogue.</p>
        <p class="p2">The exhibition opened in May 2011, and 500 people attended. She mailed copies of the show’s catalogue “all over the place—to random agencies, to editorial people.” She also got several stores to sell the catalogue, including Colette, the Paris boutique; Union in Los Angles; and Dashwood Books in New York City. </p>
        <p class="p2">Within a few months, calls for assignments started coming. The Standard hotel in Los Angeles wanted to exhibit prints from “This Charming Man” in its lobby. Jarvis instead proposed a project called “This Charming Guest,” featuring portraits of musicians, stylists, designers and directors who styled themselves, all photographed in the hotel.</p>
        <p class="p2">The images were exhibited in the hotel lobby in late 2011, and The Standard purchased several prints for permanent display in a meeting room. Jarvis also created a newsprint ‘zine of the images for distribution to hotel guests.</p>
        <p class="p2">In early 2012, when UK-based online fashion retailer ASOS started selling Vans shoes, Jarvis was hired to shoot an advertorial for the ASOS website. “I found five guys who wore Vans and photographed them in their homes,” Jarvis says. The shoot was a success for both companies, and marked the start of Jarvis’s ongoing relationship with ASOS.</p>
        <p class="p2">Another assignment that led to repeat business came from ad agency Exposure, which hired Jarvis to shoot portraits for Foot Locker promoting an exclusive line of footwear designed by Converse in collaboration with Undefeated, a boutique streetwear brand. Jarvis used social media to cast “real” guys, then she selected locations and styled the shoots herself. Foot Locker used the images for in-store displays, and also distributed ‘zines featuring the photographs to customers.</p>
        <p class="p2">Meanwhile, St&uuml;ssy hired Jarvis for the first time in 2013 for a men’s wear campaign. “They give photographers a box of clothes and a check,” she says, explaining that photographers are left to make creative decisions on their own.</p>
        <p class="p2">Jarvis was given a box full of summer clothes in the middle of winter. “So I decided to take two guys to Africa to model the stuff. I picked the guys based on the fact that they could style themselves,” she says. They went to Morocco and checked into a hotel, where Jarvis photographed them as if they were “friends on holiday, rather than [on the set of] some stuffy advertising job.”</p>
        <p class="p2">That project was a success, and led to the St&uuml;ssy x Looney Tunes assignment. For that, Jarvis says, “I used kids I knew.”</p>
        <p class="p2">The assignments are challenging, Jarvis says, because she has  to do all the location scouting, talent scouting and styling herself. “It’s definitely a little tricky, but that freedom allows you to do a little more.”</p>
        <p class="p2">Lately she’s been working to expand her range of clients beyond shoe and apparel brands. “I would love it if a luxury client wanted to hire me to shoot in this same way,” she says. Jarvis is targeting a wish list with the help of Riad Represents, which signed her last year. Meanwhile, she’s starting work on another personal project, about older African-American women.</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        Tracking shots of moving subjects reached a new level of smooth when cameraman Garrett Brown invented the Steadicam in 1975. The body-mounted stabilizer isolates the camera from the movement of the operator, allowing motion shooters to capture shake-free footage while walking, running and riding along with fast-moving subjects. 
        <p class="p1">But in an era of tight budgets and schedules, multimedia journalism and on-the-fly video production, using such a costly and cumbersome device isn’t always practical. Operating a full-size Steadicam requires practice and time to rig up and balance the camera, and even modestly priced and sized stabilization devices can sometimes be too much for today’s shoestring budgets and fast-paced shoots. </p>
        <p class="p1">We asked six photographer-directors who are veterans at video production how they achieve smooth tracking shots without using commercial stabilization gear.</p>
        <p class="p1"><strong>Physical Techniques</strong></p>
        <p class="p1">The cheapest and lightest stabilization gear is no gear at all. Some shooters develop techniques for holding the camera and moving with it to eliminate much of the shakiness associated with handheld footage. “The best thing I would do is to practice smoothing out your walk,” recommends multimedia journalist and producer <a href="http://http://www.timmatsui.com/">Tim Matsui</a>. “Hold the camera a little out from your body, be kind of flowing in your arm motions and realize that you’re going to translate your body motion into the shot.” </p>
        <p class="p1"><a href="http://vimeo.com/ericseals">Eric Seals</a>, a multimedia journalist at the <em>Detroit Free Press</em>, compares his walking technique to the footwork of a marching band: “You have to put one foot in front of the other, but do it in a smooth, fluid, gentle way. You just kind of roll. And when I’m walking, I’m also controlling my breathing.” </p>
        <p class="p1">While smooth footwork eliminates larger movements, the upper body can buffer the camera from more subtle shakiness. “I think of my body as a shock absorption tool,” says multimedia producer <a href="http://vimeo.com/darrendurlach">Darren Durlach</a>. He absorbs minor vibrations by holding his arms away from his body and keeping his grip on the camera loose. “That keeps it from those tiny jerky movements,” he says. </p>
        <p class="p1"><a href="http://vimeo.com/smkeller">Stephen Keller</a>, a photographer for Southwest Airlines, finds using a shoulder rig a happy medium between the stability of a Steadicam shot and the shakiness of a standard handheld shot, but when he’s shooting without a rig and wants a similarly smooth effect for a tracking shot, he relies on physical technique and one little accessory: his camera strap. Holding his elbows down next to his body, he pushes the camera out so that the strap is taut. “You just push it so that it creates a natural resistance,” he explains. “That will keep the camera much steadier than if you’re just handholding it.”</p>
        <p class="p1"><strong>Settings and Composition</strong></p>
        <p class="p1">Selecting the right camera settings and composition is also vital to achieving a smooth handheld tracking shot, mainly because it’s virtually impossible to adjust focus while shooting. Instead, the camera operator locks focus on the subject at the beginning of the shot, then maintains a constant distance from the subject while in motion to keep the focus sharp. Because it’s hard to maintain the distance precisely, having enough depth of field to allow for a little play is key. All of the shooters we spoke with stop down to at least f/5.6 for tracking shots when consistent focus is important. </p>
        <p class="p1">In some cases, it can be a stylistic choice to open up to f/4 or even wider, and let the subject slip in and out of focus slightly. While that’s not usually a desirable effect for journalism, it can work well in commercial and editorial pieces. “I use that kind of thing in my work quite a lot,” says <a href="http://www.rheaanna.com/">Rhea Anna</a>, who video shoots for commercial clients. “It’s something I tend to like the look of.”</p>
        <p class="p1">Shooting wide and maintaining a good amount of space around the subject can also help with both focus and steadiness by allowing camera operators to see the space they’re moving through without looking away from the viewfinder. It minimizes errors as well. “You don’t shoot tight when you’re walking with somebody,” says Seals. “The tighter you shoot, the more magnified your mistakes in walking become.” </p>
        <p class="p1">Seals also cites another benefit of leaving some room around the subject during tracking shots: Software stabilization tools such as SmoothCam in Apple’s Final Cut Pro and Warp Stabilizer in Adobe’s Premiere Pro can reduce minor camera shake in post-production, but using the software results in a little cropping around the margins. </p>
        <p class="p2">One camera setting that might seem more useful than it really is for tracking shots is built-in stabilization. “You can’t really use it for tracking shots,” says Durlach. “As you move, it’s trying to stabilize [the image] and then it jerks back. It’s kind of a strange phenomenon.” </p>
        <p class="p1"><strong>Lenses and Viewfinders</strong></p>
        <p class="p1">A wide lens is the obvious choice for tracking shots, since longer lenses amplify the effects of movement and vibrations. Canon’s 24-105mm zoom is a favorite among many of the shooters we spoke with. “For anyone doing video storytelling for newspapers, that’s the lens you want,” says Seals. </p>
        <p class="p1">Having a clear view even when holding the camera at a low angle is vital for maintaining focus during a tracking shot, so many shooters use external camera-mounted monitors such as Marshall Electronics’ 5- and 7-inch models. For eye-level tracking shots, Matsui uses a Zacuto eyepiece to improve his view. </p>
        <p class="p1"><strong>Hitching a Ride</strong></p>
        <p class="p1">No matter how much you practice walking like a human Steadicam, you’re no match for a set of wheels. Resourceful shooters are adept at rigging up whatever vehicle they find at hand, from skateboards to pallet loaders to makeshift dollies that can hold both the camera and the operator. “If you have an assistant or someone with you who can push you along, a wheelchair works really well,” says Keller. “It’s almost like you’re getting a dolly shot.”</p>
        <p class="p1">When Anna wanted to fit <a href="http://vimeo.com/85217593">a tracking shot of ice skaters</a> into an already packed production schedule, she rigged up a “sleddy-cam” even though she had a Steadicam operator standing by on set. Waiting for the operator to strap on and balance the ARRI Alexa being used for the shoot would have taken too much time. “We just didn’t have 20 minutes to spare at that point in the day,” Anna explains. Instead, she had an operator hold the camera and sit on a sled while an assistant pulled it. Not only was the footage smooth, but the camera operator was able to change shooting angles from high to low without having to make time-consuming adjustments to a Steadicam rig. </p>
        <p class="p1">To be prepared to take advantage of whatever is handy with wheels or runners, Anna carries a Manfrotto Magic Arm and clamps. “Even for simple little shoots I always want one of those in my bag with a clip clamp on one end,” she says. “I’ll take a kit with a Super Clamp, a clip clamp and a knuckle. You can pretty much rig anything with that.” She points out that finding a smooth surface to roll your makeshift dolly on is also key to getting glitch-free tracking shots. </p>
        <p class="p1">Cars are also frequently used to achieve tracking shots, especially when the subject is riding in another car. Multimedia journalist <a href="http://www.bradhornmultimedia.com/">Brad Horn</a> looks for a ride with a sunroof so that he can stand up in the passenger’s seat and shoot, and many photographers find ways to mount a camera on the hood or side of the car. Seals created an inexpensive mount by attaching four suction cups to a metal mounting plate. He mounts both digital SLRs and small GoPro cameras with his system. He uses the GoPros to produce B-roll clips and uses his smartphone as a Wi-Fi-enabled viewfinder inside the car.</p>
        <p class="p1"><strong>DIY and Makeshift Stabilization Gear </strong></p>
        <p class="p1">Seals also uses low-budget, DIY versions of commercial stabilization tools when he knows in advance that a shoot will require smooth tracking shots. For under $10, he made a rudimentary PVC pipe version of Manfrotto’s circular Fig Rig stabilizer. With his camera mounted in the center of the PVC ring, Seals holds the ring away from his body with both hands while walking to stabilize his shot. “I work at a newspaper, so we don’t have a big budget to buy something like that,” he explains. “A lot of things I use, I build and expense.” Seals points out that instructions for building homemade versions of many commercial video tools are available online, notably on YouTube.</p>
        <p class="p1">Another makeshift stabilization tool that many photographers already have in their kit is a monopod. “You just collapse the monopod, and it becomes almost like a Steadicam,” Horn explains. “It’s got a handle on it, if you’ve got a video head.” Horn uses a monopod with a panning head and a stabilizing foot that allows him to brace the pod securely against his body. “You can use your left hand to hold the panning handle and your right hand to hold the feet,” he says. He likes the flexibility of being able to switch quickly from using the monopod as a tracking shot stabilizer to extending it to the ground for static shots and panning. </p>
        <p class="p1">Still, even a monopod can be too much of an encumbrance during fast-moving journalistic shoots. As Seals explains: “If the person I’m doing a story on is doing something and all of a sudden does something else that requires a different view, I can’t tell him or her to stop and wait for me to take my monopod off and get on the ground, because then I’m influencing the situation. In journalism we have ethics, so we can’t do that.”</p>
        <p class="p1">At the end of the day, whether you’re a journalist or a commercial motion artist, one of the best reasons to become adept at improvising and using physical stabilization techniques has to do with another kind of stability—financial stability. As Matsui observes, “A lot of younger photographers are prone to investing in equipment, and then they carry it as a liability for a long time.” His advice? “Do not go into debt over gear unless you can pay it off in a short amount of time, with the job that you have or are in the process of finishing. I can’t emphasize that enough.”</p>

Photo Director Leslie dela Vega talked to PDN about how she sources the many photos the site serves up each week. A veteran of print magazines, her role at OZY is her first job at an online-only publication. A graduate of San Francisco State University, where she earned her BA in photography, dela Vega got her first magazine job at Vibe as an intern. She worked at SELF, Premiere and Teen People before returning to Vibe as its director of photography. She has also been a photo editor at Fortune, TIME, Essence and Fast Company. Last fall she returned to San Francisco, her birthplace, to work on the launch of OZY.
        <p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What is OZY’s editorial mission, and where does photography fit?</strong><br />
        Leslie dela Vega: It’s a news and culture magazine that brings information on “the new and the next” to readers in a different way. It’s about science, technology, business, the arts—really anything that will interest people—and not just what’s trending now, but what will be trending soon. To fully appreciate it, you have to go through the articles and the variety of writing styles and photography. We also have The Presidential Daily Brief: a few sentences by the senior editor, Sean Braswell, about things you need to know that are happening today, with links to sources and stories not on OZY.<br />
        <br />
        One of the reasons I came here is that, as one of the founders said, OZY doesn’t have a part-time love affair with photography. Photography is his love and he wanted the homepage to be covered with photography. The story pages also have big images at the top.</p>
        <p><strong><em>PDN</em>: So what’s your process for finding all these images?</strong><br />
        LDV: We try to work at least a week in advance. We have a content calendar and I’ll look at that and try to reach out to the writer or assigning editor to find out: Are there particular moments or people I need to find?</p>
        <p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Are you primarily researching existing images, or assigning?</strong><br />
        LDV: It’s mostly research. I go to all the photo agencies you can imagine and, if there’s something hard to find, I’ll also go to local newspapers or other sources. I love research. I find it challenging and exciting. You have to find creative ways to find the photos you need.<br />
        <br />
        When I needed a photo of Gina Raimondo, the treasurer of Rhode Island [for a story called “<a href="http://www.ozy.com/wildcard/ozy-on-women-who-shape-the-world/3069.article">OZY On: Women Who Shape the World</a>”], I couldn’t find anything great on her that would work. Then someone gave me the name of photographer <a href="http://gamminophotography.photoshelter.com/index">Mae Gammino</a> and her images [of Raimondo] worked out great.</p>
        <p><strong><em>PDN</em>: What are some of the places you look for existing images?</strong><br />
        LDV: We have subscriptions with Getty and Corbis, but often I’m looking for very specific or conceptual images and my primary source for those is Gallery Stock or a specific photographer. For a story on the epizootic of 1875, I found a beautiful fine-art image by <a href="http://www.andrewmcgibbon.co.za/#/">Andrew McGibbon</a> for our homepage. Or more recently we did a piece on the artist BONOM and I found beautiful black-and-white images of him by <a href="http://ivanput.be/">Ivan Put</a>. I use a lot of Gallery Stock images per month because they’ve got great quality and great photographers. For a story on bikes in Bogot&aacute;, Columbia, I found images on Gallery Stock. If I have a news peg in a story then it’s usually the obvious agencies, like Redux, Panos, Magnum and VII.</p>
        <p>Among the more oddball sources I’ve used is Flickr. We did a story about a Tokyo neighborhood, Shinjuku, known for its bars: They can’t fit more than three to five people. They haven’t been photographed a lot. I looked on Flickr, and found both the pictures by photographer Will Robb and Flickr user AJPSCS. I’ll e-mail the photographers [of images I find] and let them know I’d like to use their images for a fee, and most of the time they’ve been great about it and it’s worked.</p>
        <p><strong><em>PDN</em>: When do you assign photographs?</strong><br />
        LDV: I’ll go through the content calendar and figure out what has to be assigned because there’s nothing good out there. We’ve worked with some great photographers. When we needed a portrait of film director Ava DuVernay [the first African-American woman to win the U.S. Directing Award: Dramatic at the Sundance Film Festival] I reached out to a few photographers to see who could shoot it. <a href="http://www.emilyberlphoto.com/">Emily Berl</a> was totally available and did a great job. We did a portrait shoot with [writer] Zack O’Malley Greenburg in New York City; he has a new book out on hip-hop. I asked <a href="http://www.rayonrichards.com/">Rayon Richards</a> to shoot the portrait, because I like his lighting and sense of space. He had about ten minutes [with Greenburg] and did a great job.</p>
        <p>These portraits were all assigned for our “Rising Stars” feature. The Rising Stars are featured on the upper right hand corner of the homepage and it’s important that we have original art; I’m not interested in seeing a hand-out we’ve seen before.</p>
        <p>Because we are just starting out, our fees are humbling but the photographer has artistic freedom and can shoot however they want without any real limits. We just ask for one setup and a couple of angles.</p>
        <p><strong><em>PDN</em>: You’ve also run some photo essays.</strong><br />
        LDV: I’ve reached out to some photographers I know to run unpublished photo essays. Like <a href="http://www.melissagolden.com/#1">Melissa Golden</a>: For a Thanksgiving feature, we ran images from her project on Homeboy Industries in Los Angeles. We have published photo essays by <a href="http://www.benlowy.com/">Benjamin Lowy</a> on Sudanese fashion and <a href="http://www.michaellewisphotography.com/">Michael Lewis</a> on his celebrity selfies. My goal is to put in at least one photo essay a week. Another is to assign more photography. Right now it’s on an as needed basis, but I’d like it to be on an “as wanted” basis.</p>
        <p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Do you have any exclusivity requirements for the photos you’ve commissioned or licensed?</strong><br />
        LDV: No. To have that, I’d want to pay photographers a lot more, and I’m not able to do that. And, really, OZY doesn’t need [exclusivity].</p>
        <p><strong><em>PDN</em>: Japan, Colombia, the Sudan—it seems you have a lot of international stories.</strong><br />
        LDV: [OZY co-founder] Carlos Watson wants a lot of diversity in our stories and in our photos. We have one or two international stories a day. We have great writers around the world and we want to reach people not only in the United States.</p>
        <p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How has working at an online-only publication differed from working at print publications?</strong><br />
        LDV: What’s really different is that readers only have a day [to] look at the homepage and absorb it. And, if you’re working at a monthly, there’s time to prepare and think about the image you’re going to use. With a daily, it’s like the snap of a finger: I have to feel in my gut that this is the right photo, then I move on. I’ve worked at weeklies, but this is something completely different. My adrenaline is going every day. I think this is the way the world is going, and I love the feeling.</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        The debate among professional photographers about whether to use continuous lighting or strobes has raged for years, but recent technological advances are starting to change all that, with both lighting options now used by many pros.
        <p>The hard and fast rule used to be that, if you needed to stop motion in your images, you always went with strobes. The brief flash of a high-intensity bulb at several thousandths of a second was the perfect tool to stop even the fastest movement in its tracks.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if you had a stationary object or a subject that could sit still for a few seconds, the warm glow of a continuous light source was often preferred. But if you had children in the scene, you could forget about continuous lights as they rightly earned the moniker “hot lights” by getting hot enough to burn anyone within a foot of their bulbs.</p>
        <p>But times have changed for studio lighting. Gone are the days of lights so hot that it felt like you were standing directly beneath the sun. Kino Flos, tungsten lights, HMIs and fluorescent continuous lights are not only now much more color-temperature-friendly, but a lot cooler to use.</p>
        <p>As for motion, strobes are still the very best way to freeze action, but digital cameras are so advanced that a quick ISO and shutter speed bump can also help in that department.</p>
        <p>With all these advances, the playing field for continuous lighting versus strobes is a bit more level. To get a glimpse of why some pros choose one light source or the other or, in some cases, use a mixture of both, we talked to several photographers to find out what they like about continuous lighting.</p>
        <p><strong>The Simplicity of Tungsten</strong><br />
        Australian-born still-life photographer <a href="http://www.nigelcox.net/">Nigel Cox</a> has worked for everyone from Bergdorf Goodman and <em>Martha Stewart Living</em> to <em>GQ</em>, <em>Esquire</em> and <em>Bon App&eacute;tit</em>. Since moving to New York City in 1999, he’s seen just about every assignment a professional photographer can come across, and he’s approached each one as a blank slate.</p>
        <p>“I try to keep a really open mind with any project,” Cox tells <em>PDN</em>. “I try not to get too fixated on the first image that pops into my mind when I hear an idea or get a brief.”</p>
        <p>It’s an approach that has made his lighting technique change from job to job and even come full circle in the course of his career.</p>
        <p>“I have been using a lot of tungsten lately,” he says about his most recent work. “I’d used it long ago and then I ended up doing a whole period of strobe for a long time. Maybe for ten years, I didn’t use a lot of tungsten. Just sporadically. But now I’m shooting it a lot more.”</p>
        <p>For Cox, the decision to transition back to primarily tungsten lighting is about quality and fit for the jobs at hand.</p>
        <p>“I like something with really direct light and crisp shadows,” he says. “That is the main driving thing with the tungsten; getting a really crisp, beautiful shadow next to an object. Then it just happens to be that most things look great under tungsten light, like they do under sunlight.”</p>
        <p>And it’s also a matter of simplicity. Cox will often load a strobe-heavy shot with multiple lights, but the added power and consistency of tungsten has given him a chance to get back to the simplicity of one strong light.</p>
        <p>“I use a lot more lights when it comes to strobe,” says Cox. “I might have eight lights on set, and a forest of C-stands. It becomes far more complex when I’m using strobe. That’s part of why I like how simple the tungsten is, in a way. It speeds up the process because you’ve got one light source to deal with.”</p>
        <p>That doesn’t mean, however, that Cox is beholden to the tungsten bulb. While nearly all of the photographer’s client-based work is still life, his personal work includes the juxtaposition of animals and still-life objects in a series called “Lucky Dog.” He’s not afraid to break out the strobes when needed to capture the spirit of the pups.</p>
        <p>“Obviously, I’m not going to use hot lights if I’m shooting animals. I need strobes to stop the motion.”</p>
        <p><strong>High on HMI</strong><br />
        For Richmond, Virginia, stock photographer and videographer <a href="http://www.arielskelley.com/">Ariel Skelley</a>, the use of strobes seems like a distant memory now that her business focuses so heavily on video capture with her HD-DSLR. After using strobes for over two decades, the transition into stock videography made Skelley swap out nearly all her lighting gear for continuous HMI lighting, which has created a brand new workflow.</p>
        <p>“I was an assignment shooter out of New York City for 20 years,” she tells <em>PDN</em>. “In order to be a stay-at-home mom, I took a demotion to shoot stock. Shooting stock resurrected my interest in photography altogether, but it has necessitated switching out equipment. In one fell swoop, I got rid of all the Profoto strobes and bought Joker Bugs [continuous HMI lights], and started letting the action go for ten seconds instead of 1/250 of a second. Frankly, it’s a lot easier to tell the story in ten seconds. If it’s a kid opening a Christmas present, you get to see what’s inside the present.”</p>
        <p>In order for her stock buyers to see those presents, however, Skelley needs powerful continuous lights, and not just for her video capture.</p>
        <p>“The requirements for stock are really tough,” she says, “and there’s not much leeway. They’re real sticklers for, particularly, focus.”</p>
        <p>In the past, strobes would have been Skelley’s go-to light source for making tack-sharp stock images, but the addition of video would have meant carrying around two completely separate lighting kits.</p>
        <p>“I’ve got four Joker Bug 5600 lights,” says Skelley. “They’re beefy lights. I bring all four of those with me on location and sometimes I’ll bring a few Kino Flo lights with me, too. The negative side was the price ticket, but the positive side was not only that you get to work with this new media [video] but you also get to double your income.”</p>
        <p>It’s not, however, just the efficiency or simplicity of continuous lighting that Skelley prefers. She recognizes that there’s a qualitative difference in her work with continuous lights as well.</p>
        <p>“My favorite is constant lighting, but I consider the sun to be a constant light,” she says. “All any of us are doing—particularly in lifestyle imagery—is attempting to replicate what the sun is doing. The continuous lights also bathe the models in a nice glow. When people hear the pop, pop, pop of strobes, that’s become the audio signal to pretend you’re [posing for] a Vogue cover, which is so not what I need.”</p>
        <p>And the advances in technology that have come along during her lengthy career aren’t lost on Skelley either. “I started in photography shooting Polaroids to test the light. Having continuous lights is nice to be able to see what you get.”</p>
        <p><strong>Mixing it Up</strong><br />
        Perhaps the most interesting use of continuous lights comes from <a href="http://jr-brown.com/">Jeff Brown</a>. With clients that include <em>The New York Times Magazine</em>, <em>Fast Company</em>, <em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em>, <em>WIRED</em> and <em>New York</em>, the Brooklyn, New York-based photographer, recently chosen for <em>PDN</em>’s 30, has begun to make a name for himself with unique and striking portraits that feature stark contrast and bold lighting and are often just slightly askew from reality.</p>
        <p>“There are a lot of really clean, incredibly efficient styles in photography,” Brown tells <em>PDN</em>, “but I just want things to be unique.”</p>
        <p>Citing influences from such varied photographers as Yousuf Karsh, Richard Burbridge and Nadav Kander, Brown is far from simplistic when setting up his lights. Not only does he use multiple types of lights, often mixing strobe with his continuous light sources, but he also packs his studio full of numerous lights to get the effects he needs for each particular shot.</p>
        <p>“The minimum is usually five lights and … all the way to seven,” he says. “I like to mix strobes with tungsten as well. I use a mixture for almost everything. I prefer hot lights, but I kind of like working with both. There’s a level of excitement and I feel like I’m a better craftsman.”</p>
        <p>If you push Brown to make a choice between continuous lighting and strobes, he’ll come down on the side of hot lights, but don’t, for a second, think he’ll give up his strobes.</p>
        <p>“The money jobs want everything super sharp so I might need strobes there to stop any motion,” he says. “I like to use long lenses as well so I’ll drop focus and stuff without strobes, but I prefer the hot lights. They wrap around the skin, whereas strobes kind of punch through it. In this way, it’s like the difference between a really sharp digital picture and a really sharp film picture. [The hot light] gives you the softer sharpness. There’s a thing about strobe where you can just tell the difference.”</p>
        <p>Shooting with Canon EOS 5D Mark II and Mark III camera bodies, Brown will mix up his lighting kit to include both and, in certain cases, even bring in bigger and stronger continuous lights.</p>
        <p>“If you want people moving around or if you want a full-length shot, then you need to get into larger lights,” he says.</p>
        <p>And it helps that Brown rarely ever puts any diffusion between his lights and his subjects. One notable exception is his recent portrait of Texas Senator Wendy Davis for the cover of <em>The New York Times Magazine</em>. “Typically, I use straight lights, even for strobes,” he says. “No diffusion.”</p>
        <p>It’s an interesting concept and a far cry from the lighting techniques employed by professional photographers just a decade ago. The technology has come so far that almost regardless of what types of lights photographers use, the results will often end up sharp, detailed and usable.</p>
        <p>Lighting kits have become one of the most important ways that photographers can embrace their creativity and set themselves apart from others in the field. Rather than worrying about which light they have to use, they can now focus on which lights they want to use.</p>
        <p>“I remember once, to stop movement when I was shooting catalogue, we wired up an elevator sensor remote control that opened and closed the doors, so that when the models stepped over that hairline trigger, they would be in focus and the camera would shoot,” Skelley says with a laugh. “That’s how we stopped movement at that time.”</p>
        <p>Whether it’s continuous or strobe, it’s pretty clear that technology has gone a long way in helping photographers everywhere see the light.</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[The man smiles broadly, revealing several missing teeth, as he holds his callused and bandaged hands up to the camera, palms out. They are the tools of a blues musician and, even without a guitar, they tell one hell of a story. “Portraits of the Blues” by <a href="http://www.loubopp.com/">Lou Bopp</a> is a fascinating visual compendium depicting—through portraits, landscapes and details—a fading culture and the musicians who helped build it, with their hands and guitars.<br />
<br />
Bopp is a commercial photographer whose client list is packed with heavyweights like Time Warner, <em>Sports Illustrated</em> and American Express. He has worked all over the world, once shooting on three continents in a single day, but it wasn’t an assignment that brought him to rural Mississippi, the birthplace of blues, it was his own love of the music. For Bopp, this project is first an act of documentation. He is keenly aware that the sun is setting on these aging musicians and with them, a golden era in American culture and music. “There are not a lot of young bluesmen in the pipeline unfortunately,” Bopp notes. “I have photographed 70 to 80 musicians and about half have already passed.”<br />
<br />
Bopp credits his own curiosity for much of his success as a photographer; it’s also what inspired “Portraits of the Blues,” which is currently showing at <a href="http://www.augusthousestudio.com/augusthousestudio/">August House Studio</a> in Chicago. Bopp grew up a fan of artists like Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones and Jimi Hendrix. As he explored their influences, he found they invariably led back to the blues. Bopp became a fan of the music and years later that same investigative urge spurred him to ride his motorcycle down Route 61 from his home in Missouri to Clarksdale, Mississippi, a historic blues hotbed. What was intended to be a daytrip stretched into three or four days of roaming the Delta, searching for the music. That first spur-of-the-moment trip yielded photographs of legends Big George Brock and Robert “Wolfman” Belfour, along with an invaluable resource in Roger Stolle, a writer, artist and owner of Cat Head Delta Blues &amp; Folk Art, a store in Clarksdale.<br />
<br />
Connections proved invaluable to Bopp, as actually finding the musicians was and is the most difficult part of the project. Using an ever-expanding network of like minds and employing the occasional local fixer, Bopp found his way to the music, even if it meant being a long way from paved road. He makes it clear that a willingness to compensate his subjects went a long way; after all, some of the artists had made a good living playing the blues, but most hadn’t, regardless of their place in the canon. “I paid honorariums to everyone I shot,” he says. “Their time is valuable, my time is valuable. I respect people’s time.”<br />
<br />
No matter his commercial workload, Bopp always makes time for personal projects. He credits his years spent working on the blues project in Mississippi with allowing him to “get back to the roots” of his love for photography. A penchant for travel and culture are what brought him to the art form, and that is what drove him back to Clarksdale, time and time again.<br />
<br />
Bopp decided early on that he wanted to shoot the artists in their element, but not onstage. “I wanted to shoot them behind the scenes, at their homes,” Bopp explains. “One guy, Pat Thomas, I shot him at his father’s graveside. I wanted to get a little deeper and peel away the layer of their public persona.” His aim was to pull back the curtain, as it were, and capture something more intimate.<br />
<br />
His photographs of Wesley “Junebug” Jefferson are a particularly poignant example. Roger Stolle put Bopp in touch with the obscure-but-legendary Delta bluesman, and though he was ailing, Jefferson invited the photographer to his home. The bedridden musician insisted on being photographed with his guitar and, unnerved but profoundly honored, Bopp obliged. Jefferson passed away only days later.<br />
<br />
Unlike his commercial assignments with their attendant crews, production meetings and top-down creative direction, “Portraits of the Blues” has been a lean operation. Bopp works alone, traveling light and following his own compass. That challenge—and freedom—is part of why he finds the entire experience of pursuing his own projects so rewarding. He relies heavily on natural light, which he finds in abundance in the South. “The patina is beautiful, its got tons of character,” Bopp says. “Some guys got dressed up for me and some didn’t, I tried not to dictate things.”<br />
<br />
Balancing the demands of his commercial work and “Portraits of the Blues” was a bit of a “juggling act,” but Bopp is proud to have never canceled any appointments—not with his ad clients and not in Mississippi. Structurally, his approach to shooting the images remained the same: get the “meat and potatoes” first. In one world that meant shooting the creative brief before trying to do it his way. In Mississippi it meant “think fast,” and make sure you get a shot you can use, all the while leaving “space for serendipitous moments,” he says.<br />
<br />
Bopp’s income from his commercial work also allowed him to self-fund “Portraits of the Blues.” Surprisingly, chasing his passion in Mississippi would open the door for more commercial work when his images caught the attention of an agency in Jackson, Mississippi, which contacted him directly. What initially was going to be a simple licensing arrangement ended with Bopp directing four TV spots for the Mississippi Tourism Association.]]></article_text>

            <article_text><![CDATA[Photographer, filmmaker and educator Eduardo Angel shares his tips for lighting your videos. He'll be teaching "Filmmaking Fundamentals" at <a href="http://www.photoplusexpo.com/conference/conference-about.shtml">the PhotoPlus Expo conference</a> on Saturday October 24. 
<p><strong>1. Use continuous light instead of natural light</strong><br />
Video often requires shooting over extended periods of time where you have to tear down and reproduce scenes days or weeks apart. Using continuous light—and a light meter—allows you to replicate the same lighting for each shoot. Try to minimize the impact of uncontrollable natural light by blocking the light (e.g., covering windows). In short, try to minimize the unknowns—those things you cannot control.</p>
<p><strong>2. Find the color balance</strong><br />
Knowing the color temperature of a scene is key for video so always have a colorimeter handy. Like matching the exposure, color temperature is critical for replicating shooting conditions. Additionally, without color temperature continuity, post-production is more time-consuming and expensive.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use adjustable LEDs to balance mixed lighting</strong><br />
Continuous light fixtures with adjustable Kelvin temperatures like the Limelite Mosaic Bi-Colour LED Panel are ideal for balancing mixed lighting, almost eliminating the need to gel the lights. They can also be battery operated, so they are a great complement for outdoor shooting.</p>
<p><strong>4. Harness and control sunlight when shooting outdoors</strong><br />
Place diffusion material between the sun and the subject when shooting outdoors to prevent harsh highlights and use a reflector to eliminate shadows, just as you would in still photography.</p>
<p><strong>5. Control lighting direction with barn doors</strong><br />
This is especially important with LEDs, which tend to spill the light. By using barn doors (or creating your own with cardboard and gaffer’s tape), you can direct the light and, ultimately, the viewer’s eye, which automatically goes to what is highlighted.</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[<a href="http://danielberehulak.com/">Daniel Berehulak</a>’s photo story about a sudden epidemic of severe childhood malnutrition in Afghanistan is difficult viewing. The distended bellies and prematurely aged faces of distraught children conjure the tragic images of African famines of the 1980s, and force viewers to wonder: How could this possibly happen?<br />
<br />
<em>The New York Times</em> reporter Rod Nordland was exploring the reasons last fall when International Picture Editor David Furst sent Berehulak, a freelancer, to Kabul on a two-month assignment to cover various stories for the paper. Berehulak recently won Freelance/Agency Photographer of the Year honors at POYi, partly on the strength of the malnutrition story that he ended up working on with Nordland.<br />
<br />
“I’ve been following [Berehulak’s work] for a long time,” says Furst, explaining why he sent Berehulak. “He has a unique and brilliant eye, and experience covering that part of the world.”<br />
<br />
Berehulak had been a staff photographer at Getty Images for eight years, and has rotated in and out of Afghanistan since 2009. He landed in Kabul for The Times last September, right after leaving Getty to freelance. Upon arrival, his first order of business was to sit down with Times editors and reporters to talk about the stories in progress.<br />
<br />
The malnutrition story, says Furst, “had the potential to get a lot of attention. It was a priority [and] I talked to Daniel about the need to spend extra time on it.”<br />
<br />
Berehulak began accompanying Nordland to hospitals and clinics to talk to doctors and aid workers. With a driver and translator, they visited treatment facilities in Kabul, and Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand Province.<br />
<br />
Berehulak’s challenges were many, beginning with safety. “Lashkar Gah is a sketchy area,” he says. Bost Hostpital in Lashkar Gah, where children are treated for malnutrition, also serves as a military field hospital. Those brought in for treatment for gunshots and other war wounds “are possibly Taliban,” Berehulak says. Kidnapping was a risk, “if you spent too much time in one place.”<br />
<br />
They had to limit visits to Bost Hospital to just two or three, each for a short period of time. “Word gets around” that journalists are there, Berehulak says. He and Nordland checked in with Times editors in the morning and evening, and traveled with a GPS tracker so the newspaper’s security personnel could track their whereabouts at all times.<br />
<br />
“One afternoon, we were outside to get an exterior frame of the hospital,” Berehulak says, “and after about five minutes, the translator said, ‘OK, that’s it. We’re out of here.’”<br />
<br />
Another challenge was building trust with NGO personnel. They’re suspicious because they’ve had encounters with some insensitive journalists, Berehulak explains. “So they want to know who you are, where you’re from, what you’re doing, what your intentions are. They don’t want their work conveyed in a bad light.”<br />
<br />
NGO staff also hovered to make sure that Berehulak got permission to photograph patients. “We weren’t able to work completely freely,” he says. But he doesn’t blame the NGOs. They’re trying to protect Afghans, especially women. “Even if they consented [to be photographed], it was mentioned to us that if someone saw their identity, they could be killed,” Berehulak explains.<br />
<br />
He had to let a lot of good photographs go for want of permission to shoot. And women who agreed to be photographed with their children automatically covered their faces, which made intimate photographs particularly elusive.<br />
<br />
“It was frustrating not to be able to show candid moments,” he says. “I really wanted to capture the connection between the mothers and children.”<br />
<br />
And then there were esthetic challenges. He was shooting in hospitals and clinics, where available lighting was poor, there wasn’t much visual variety from one room to the next and where a lot of medical equipment makes for cluttered backgrounds.<br />
<br />
Berehulak says the many challenges forced him to work all the more to get good photographs. He notes that photographers are drawn to Afghanistan “because it’s a visually striking country. The rugged faces of the people, and the beautiful colors stand out in stark contrast to the grim realities of living there.”<br />
<br />
The colors certainly worked in Berehulak’s favor. The lead image shows a mother in a dark-blue burka against a dark-green wall, holding her 8-month-old son Samiullah, who was suffering from an advanced form of malnutrition called marasmus. The child is in distress; the colors and the mother’s head-to-toe covering add a sense of foreboding.<br />
<br />
“We were interviewing another family,” Berehulak recounts, “when I turned around and saw [Samiullah and his mother] and I thought: Whoa! To see a young child that has the face of an adult is deeply disturbing. I immediately reacted: That is really desperate, and really awful.”<br />
<br />
Berehulak had permission to photograph in the room; he looked at the mother and she assented to a picture by standing up, covering her face and patiently waiting for Berehulak to take the picture.<br />
<br />
“For me, that is the picture from this take,” says Furst. Not all photographers would have seen that image before it was shot, but Berehulak “is able to go in and see those pictures.”<br />
<br />
Another image, “equally as haunting,” Berehulak says, shows four malnourished children on three beds in the intensive-care unit of Bost Hospital. Their mothers sit on the beds with them, hiding their faces from the camera.<br />
<br />
“I had to work really hard to layer the image, to show three or four critically ill children lying in close proximity,” he says, explaining that he wanted to convey the scope of the crisis.<br />
<br />
“To get them all in one frame, I worked that room from different angles,” he says. “You’re limited to what you can [depict] in a hospital. It’s all about, literally, millimeters, positioning yourself so you get everyone framed to show the magnitude” of the problem.<br />
<br />
Berehulak says he would have liked to be able to go to the villages where families of malnourished children came from, “and paint a picture of [the environment] and the issues they were having.” That may have provided a clearer understanding of how extensive the malnutrition situation is, and the reasons for it, Berehulak surmises. But for safety reasons, he says, going to remote villages to photograph “wasn’t possible at all.”<br />
<br />
Despite the limitations and frustrations, Berehulak “filed an exceptional set of pictures,” Furst says. The work “called people’s attention to the problem. It got people to look. It’s hard to cut through the noise, and he did. That’s a testament to his sensitive eye.”
<p><em>The New York Times</em> has posted a gallery of the images (<a href="http://nyti.ms/1e21Jth">http://nyti.ms/1e21Jth</a>).

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <a href="http://www.christophgielen.com/" target="_blank">Christoph Gielen</a>’s new book, <em><a href="http://www.artbook.com/9783868593181.html" target="_blank">Ciphers</a></em>, tackles questions of land use and sustainable growth from an uncommon perspective: the air. Photographed from helicopters, suburban developments in the American West are transformed into alien topography; the familiar trappings of residential life (houses, yards, streets and highways) become jigsaws of geometric abstraction. An infinite collection of hexagons, loops and ovals, Gielen’s images are reminiscent of crop circles, wondrous in their scale and meticulous design yet foreboding and possessed of a fearful symmetry. <br />
        <br />
        “My goal with <em>Ciphers</em> is to examine the broader ramifications of building trends well beyond North American borders, and to bring about an understanding of growth machines that systematically generate ever more car-dependent, low-density suburbanization,” Gielen explains. At a time when unprecedented growth is happening in emerging nations, he hopes that this work will contribute to conversations about development that may help other countries avoid the mistakes America has already made.<br />
        <br />
        An artist and environmental advocate, Gielen has used photography as a means of communicating ideas pertaining to development and land use for a number of years. Although he was familiar with the aerial photography of artists like Michael Light, David Maisel and Edward Burtynsky, it was an experience much closer to the ground that turned Gielen’s ambitions skyward. In 2003, his interest in urban planning led him to document the controlled demolition of a public housing project in Scotland. He was camped out on the roof of a neighboring high-rise, waiting for the detonation, when he realized how striking the landscape was from this new vantage point. “[It was] a pivotal moment, which made me realize that in order to provide a larger perspective—quite literally—on how we currently live, I would have to get up above,” Gielen says. <br />
        <br />
        Inspired, the German-born artist decided that, as an epicenter of car-centric growth and its attendant sprawl, Southern California would be his focus. With financing a major concern, Gielen’s process on <em>Ciphers</em> involved doing as much work as possible before he got up in the air. He combed through public records on foreclosure statistics, wildfire occurrences and income distribution to identify potential locations. He then did additional research using geological maps and satellite imagery, looking for locations that would be compelling from the air, whether because of extravagant architecture, cookie-cutter uniformity or layout quirks only visible from above. He was also limited to renting out blocks of time with a flight instructor and shooting photos out of a single-engine, light-utility helicopter with its door removed. <br />
        <br />
        Aerial photography brings with it a range of unique conditions: the vibrations of the aircraft, the velocity of the wind and, for an artist working in a purely analogue format as Gielen was, the challenge of changing film rolls while hanging onto the outside of a moving helicopter. “It took several aerial missions to realize an optimum, workable shutter speed, given that I couldn’t work with a stabilizing gyro,” he says, because it would make moving the camera difficult and “prohibit pointing the camera down vertically.”<br />
        <br />
        Perhaps the biggest challenge was that Gielen depended on the pilot to get him the shots he wanted. Before long, Gielen concluded it was worth the added expense to work with pilots who had experience in the film industry; those pilots had a much better understanding of the altitudes and angles Gielen was looking for, and also kept the aircraft steady while shielding him from the wind. <br />
        <br />
        In the early going, Gielen was able to use his income from working at another photographer’s studio to finance the project. But when he began working independently in 2008, the need for alternative funding became pressing, especially as he began to work with larger and more expensive helicopters and crews. During “countless coffee-fueled days” at the <a target="_blank" href="http://foundationcenter.org/newyork/">Foundation Center</a>, a grant research center in New York City, he sought out funding from disparate sources whose interests matched his own. Gielen’s approach was to cast a wide net, in fields including photography, visual arts, land preservation and education, and to take anything he could get, no matter how modest. A German citizen, Gielen also actively looked for grants in the European Union.<br />
        <br />
        On a purely esthetic level, <em>Ciphers</em> is an arresting, mesmerizing piece of art, but it’s the inclusion of several thought-provoking essays that gives the work another dimension. For Gielen, his images are a means to an end, and as such are best served by an interdisciplinary approach. From architects, urban planners and climate-change activists, to cultural philosophers and self-described futurist Geoff Manaugh, Gielen brings together a heavyweight collection of thinkers to contextualize his aerial hieroglyphs. <br />
        <br />
        While <em>Ciphers</em> has been well received by architects, Gielen hopes that the book’s publication in the U.S. will bring greater engagement with a broader audience. He believes that seeking out new interdisciplinary collaborations and drawing connections between his work and current events in the U.S.—like post-Hurricane Sandy rebuilding—will help. “The primary audience for this project comes from the fields of architecture, land preservation, art and photography. But of course I’d also like to reach out to a more varied audience, such as educators, students, academics specializing in urban development and policy, journalists and writers, city planners, and anyone interested in society’s role in land use and its effects on the environment.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div>Few wild animals have captured the human imagination quite like the wolf. They show up in our fables and our novels, they are the ancestors of man’s best friend and they are among the most researched animals in the world. Yet <a href="http://www.anniemusselman.com/" target="_blank">Annie Marie Musselman</a>’s new project about <a href="http://www.wolfhaven.org/" target="_blank">Wolf Haven International</a>, a wolf sanctuary in Washington State, manages to show wolves in a new light. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Musselman created the work in collaboration with Wolf Haven after receiving a Getty Images Grant for Good, which provided her and a designer with funding to perform “a full media restoration” for the sanctuary. (The grant program has since been rebranded as <a href="http://imagery.gettyimages.com/getty_images_grants/default.aspx?isource=direct-entry_grants" target="_blank">Getty Images Creative Grants</a>.)</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>In her images, Musselman quietly captures an intimate communion of these wolves and the woods of the Pacific Northwest. In one photograph, a wolf stands, almost politely, near a hole he has scraped in the damp earth, ears perked, eyes doleful. In another, a white wolf approaches cautiously, caught mid-stride in the long lush green grass. We see sunlight streaming through the trees, setting wolves’ fur aglow as they bask in the warmth. Taken as a whole, there is a serenity to these images that is rarely associated with the wolf.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“I strive to show these wolves as if I had happened upon them in the forest, to portray them as wild but also gentle, beautiful and loving creatures, unlike the way they are often portrayed in films and in the media as bloodthirsty hunters and killers,” Musselman explains. “I wanted to light them and make them stand out in nature.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Photographing animals has long been a passion for the Seattle-based photographer—her first personal project, “<a href="http://www.anniemusselman.com/index.php?/personal/finding-trust-/" target="_blank">Finding Trust</a>,” is a series of images made at Sarvey Wildlife Rehabilitation Center, a hospital for wild creatures near Seattle. That project began seven years ago, when Musselman, reeling from the loss of her mother, started volunteering at Sarvey (a book of the work is out this month from <a href="http://www.artbooksheidelberg.com/html/detail/en/annie-marie-musselman-978-3-86828-419-5.html" target="_blank">Kehrer Verlag</a>). While working with and photographing the injured and sick animals, she felt a connection to the wild creatures in her care. During a time of great personal tragedy (her father passed away a few years later), Musselman credits her experiences at Sarvey as part of a healing process and the impetus for an entirely new artistic direction.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“I slowly developed this hyper-real connection to animals. I think that came from lots of exposure to the wild ones,” Musselman says. “They aren’t quite as easy [to get close to] as domestic, so it made me try harder for some reason. I wanted their approval—sounds crazy but I just felt an all encompassing love for them.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>That love led her to join organizations like the <a href="http://www.blueearth.org/" target="_blank">Blue Earth Alliance</a>, a nonprofit that supports photographic projects relating to environmental conservation. When Musselman began to formulate a concrete plan for a project about animal sanctuaries around the world, Blue Earth provided her with the services of a grant writer who helped her create a proposal. The project, “For the Innocent,” focuses on the plight of so-called “keystone species,” whose presence within an ecosystem is key to the well-being of other species. In 2009, she photographed orangutans in Borneo with funding from <em>Mother Jones</em> and <em>Newsweek</em>. She returned to the U.S. energized by what she had seen and bent on getting back to Asia as soon as possible. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Serendipitously, a fellow photographer tipped Musselman off to the Getty Images Grants for Good program over drinks the night before submissions were due. By the next day she had tweaked her grant proposal. She won the Getty grant in 2010 and set up a trip to an Indonesian wildlife sanctuary, only to find out her new pregnancy made traveling to a malarial region risky. Having already purchased tickets for herself and an assistant, Musselman had no choice but to swallow the lost airfare and start looking for something closer to home. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Wolf Haven International is a sanctuary set on 82 acres of prairie, wetlands and woodland in western Washington State. Once Musselman did some research on the 30-year-old nonprofit, she knew it was the right place for her work—she just had to convince them.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“Most sanctuaries are very private and protected; it’s very difficult to get them to believe that what you are doing can help them,” the photographer explains. But Musselman and Wolf Haven Executive Director Diane Gallegos had a rapport from the beginning, and once she saw how dedicated Musselman was and realized the benefits the photography and design could offer, she was sold.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Starting in the winter of 2011, every Tuesday and Thursday for 18 months, Musselman traveled to Wolf Haven to shoot. She wanted to make the wolves “look magnificent” and quickly realized just how challenging that would be. The 50-odd animals were paired off in large enclosures and had varying reactions to the photographer. Some were friendly and eagerly let Musselman pet them through the chain-link fence, others were afraid and reclusive; a few were openly hostile. The fence kept her safe, but it also added another obstacle to framing her shots. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Musselman primarily used a <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/eos_slr_camera_systems/eos_digital_slr_cameras/eos_5d_mark_ii" target="_blank">Canon EOS 5D Mark II</a>, which allowed her to work in low light and shoot video. However, a lot of her favorite images were shot with a <a href="http://www.mamiyaleaf.com/legacy_mamiya7_ii.asp" target="_blank">Mamiya 7</a>, and she regrets that lighting conditions often made it impractical for her to shoot film: It was difficult to know how the light was interacting with the fence at different angles without the instant feedback of digital. Maneuverability was also a concern when it came to choosing equipment. “I used a <a href="http://www.qtm.com/index.php/products/qflash" target="_blank">Qflash</a>, which simulates the look of a studio setup but is much smaller, with a portable battery pack that I can swing around my arm or [hang] on the tripod holding the light, perfect and compact. Then I used two [radio] slaves, so everything is battery powered and portable,” Musselman says.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Musselman’s bond with the wolves was matched by the affinity she found with the women and men who make Wolf Haven work. She compares the atmosphere to that of a family, and once she was “in,” they did everything they could to make her work the best it could be—even if that meant allowing her to stay late and let herself out. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>During the summer she would enjoy long evenings with the ravens and the trees, but even during the winter she would put in five or six hours in the cold and wet, hoping to shoot something good. “I was looking for that expression of gentleness, peace and calm that they showed so much, with a little splash of fancy lighting,” she laughs, “if I could get it!”</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <div>The <a href="http://aliciapatterson.org/" target="_blank">Alicia Patterson Foundation</a> (APF) has been providing six-month and one-year fellowships to support independent journalism for decades. But the fellowships can be difficult for photographers to win, says <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em> photographer April Saul, who managed to win one of 11 fellowships awarded this year. Photographer <a href="http://grahammacindoe.com/" target="_blank">Graham MacIndoe</a> also won a joint fellowship with writer Susan Stellin. </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Saul explains that the application process favors writers because proposals have to be about 2,000 words long, and the foundation likes to support hard-hitting investigative projects. Fellows are expected to deliver articles for publication in the foundation’s quarterly publication, APF Reporter. And the competition is stiff because the full-year fellowships provide $40,000 for the year ($20,000 for six months). </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Only about a dozen photographers have won APF Fellowships over the last decade, including Andrea Bruce (2011), Shiho Fukada (2010), Alessandra Sanguinetti (2010), Brenda Ann Kenneally (2008), Tomas van Houtryve (2008) and Jon Lowenstein (2008).</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“It’s a journalism fellowship, not an arts grant,” says Stellin, who emphasizes the importance of researching past winners and their topics before applying, and the importance of understanding APF’s mission: to “provide support for journalists engaged in rigorous, probing, spirited, independent and skeptical work that will benefit the public.”  </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Fellowships awarded this year went to journalists exploring criminal and social justice, healthcare and environmental issues. Stellin and MacIndoe applied for their project called “<a href="http://grahammacindoe.com/The-UnAmericans/1/" target="_blank">The UnAmericans: Detained, Deported and Divided</a>,” about people—including legal U.S. residents and asylum seekers—caught up in aggressive deportation proceedings.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“The [proposals] that really stand out are the ones that have a sense of urgency about them,” says Margaret Engel, executive director of the foundation. “Graham and Susan opened judges’ eyes to injustices going on daily in this country” because of immigration enforcement policies. “Families are being shattered in a random way. They presented a persuasive case and statistics to show this is a problem that isn’t going away and needs some attention.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Saul’s project, called “<a href="https://nppa.org/gallery/63008" target="_blank">Camden, NJ: No Place to Grow Up</a>,” is about the social impact of poverty and violence in a failing city. Saul says she had applied for an APF fellowship without success at least four times previously for another long-term project called “American Family.” The project is about several families Saul has been documenting since the 1980s.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Other photographers have documented American cities in decline, Engel says, but Saul has an exceptional eye. “Her photographic talent, her writing talent, her commitment to project and [her] ability to be six levels deep pushed her right to the top.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The questions Saul always got when selling her stories to journalists who are writers—and APF Fellowship jurors—were, “‘Why this story? Why now?’ They were always looking for justification for what I was doing. The ‘American Family’ project defied those conventions.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Last year, while attending an NPPA workshop, Saul sought some advice from photojournalist <a href="http://louiepalu.photoshelter.com/" target="_blank">Louie Palu</a>, who has won The Aftermath Project, Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting and Alexia Foundation grants. “He said, ‘If you’re not getting a grant for a project you’re suggesting, just suggest a different project.’”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>It wasn’t what Saul wanted to hear, but she took the advice. Not only did the Camden project fit the Fellowship’s criteria better than her family project, but Saul had been working on it since 2011. Unlike some other grant and fellowship providers, APF favors projects in progress, because they want to see evidence of the applicant’s commitment.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>MacIndoe says, “You could tell from the judges’ [questions during the interview] that it was important that we had put in a serious amount of time and money—we had done a lot of leg work first.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>

        </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>In her application, Saul mentioned that she already had numerous contacts in Camden, and that she’d won major awards for her work to date, including two Casey Medals for Meritorious Journalism, awarded by the <a href="http://www.journalismcenter.org/" target="_blank">Journalism Center on Children &amp; Families</a>. She also mentioned that she lives about five miles away from Camden. “I’m not parachuting in” to report a story from a long distance, she explains. “I think it would be easier [for jurors] to feel secure giving me a grant.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Those points strengthened Saul’s application, but she’s convinced that showing jurors her ability to write made a critical difference. “I’m unusual among photographers in my ability to write well. I was an English major,” she says. In addition to including a portfolio of images, she submitted clips of stories about Camden that she had written for the<em> Philadelphia Inquirer</em>.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>She also wrote a clear, compelling proposal that grabbed the jurors’ attention from the start. “It is hard to imagine a more dangerous place to grow up than Camden, NJ—the poorest, most violent city in America,” her proposal began. She then laid out some alarming statistics about poverty, unemployment, education, healthcare and crime in Camden, and gave a succinct explanation for the city’s troubles.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“For a half-century,” Saul wrote, “Camden has suffered tremendous loss of industry and corrupt politicians, including several mayors who were sent to prison. After race riots in the late 1960s, thousands of residents fled to the suburbs. What remains is a troubled shell of a city, with a thriving drug trade …”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Saul’s work in Camden to date has focused primarily on the stories of individuals caught up in the violence. Her proposal—and the portfolio of images she submitted with it—put a human face on her project. For instance, she described the plight of one particular subject, a young boy whose life changed when he got caught in drug war crossfire and lost his eyesight as a result.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>But Saul was able to explain Camden’s broad social, economic and political conditions with authority because she did research about the city in preparation for her application. That research led her to information about issues she wasn’t aware of—the connections between an asthma epidemic and air pollution, and family instability and dropout rates, for instance—and provided her with ideas for expanding her project.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“I am not applying for this fellowship to pursue a new idea, but to deepen my work in a community close to my home and heart—and where I already have numerous contacts,” she wrote in her application. She went on to discuss “four approximate areas” she intended to report on with words and pictures: Hunger/Health Care, Poverty/Education, Violence/Trauma and Mentors.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“The [foundation] wants four quarterly articles for their magazine, and that’s why my proposal is divided into four parts,” Saul explains.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>MacIndoe says that from his perspective, APF jurors “are trying to support people who are doing work on a topic they’re passionate about.” And a key to his and Stellin’s success, he adds, was the practice they got applying for grants. “You refine your application, and after three or four attempts you realize the first [application] wasn’t that good. This time it was really tight, really compelling,” he says.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>He and Stellin also believe writers and photographers collaborating on a single proposal have an advantage, because media outlets are interested in combining text and images on different platforms—and the APF wants applicants to distribute their work as broadly as possible. “We didn’t propose a traditional project. We proposed a project for different platforms and outlets,” Stellin says.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>The application process also included an interview. “I thought I blew it,” Saul says. Other applicants came with “facts in their laps, and sweeping reports on institutions and government agencies.” When jurors asked her to tell them about recent legislation that might impact people in Camden, she told them she’s not a policy “wonk.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“The whole thing for me is to help people understand each other better,” Saul explains. She anticipated being asked what was missing from coverage about Camden, given that it has received a lot of national media attention. Saul used social media to crowd-source answers to that question before her interview.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>A number of people responded that Camden was being demonized, and coverage enforced stereotypes about poverty and crime. To Saul’s surprise, jurors asked who besides Inquirer readers might care about the plight of Camden. Saul told them the city was already getting national media attention, then explained that she was trying to get beyond usual media stereotypes about cities like Camden and the people who live there.</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>“There are so many people leading ordinary lives, and people trying to improve the place,” she says she told jurors. She adds, “I’m interested in providing a window for how other people live.”</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Saul begins a yearlong sabbatical from the Inquirer in June to work full-time on her Camden project. MacIndoe and Stellin have split their fellowship grant, and will each spend six months working on their “UnAmericans” project.</div>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        No photographer is an island, to borrow a phrase. Careers have always been built as much on relationships with mentors (and peers) as they’ve been built on talent. Traditionally, the path to a career as a photographer was through apprenticeship: assisting for several years at one or two studios. Many photographers continue to take that path, but with access to information and resources online, photographers are less bound to old ways of learning their craft. But even so, photography is driven by vision, which is difficult to learn from YouTube tutorials. The lifeblood of photography is (and always will be) interaction among people, and direct one-on-one sharing of insight and knowledge. Mentors are invaluable for their advice, encouragement, and constructive criticism. <br />
        <em><br />
        PDN</em>’s 30 photographers tell us stories every year about the differences mentors have made in their careers. Here we list some of the <a href="http://pdns30.com/gallery/2014/#grid">2014 <em>PDN</em>’s 30</a> and their mentors, along with stories from a few photographers about the difference their mentors have made to them.<br />
        <strong><br />
        Jeff Brown:</strong> High-school journalism teacher Pete Leblanc, college teacher Jody Fisher; “the love and encouragement of Sarah Wilmer, Erik Madigan Heck and Jackson Melamed have been invaluable.”<br />
        <strong><br />
        Fabio Bucciarelli:</strong> Philip Blenkinsop, Mimmo Candito.<br />
        <strong><br />
        Camilla de Maffei: </strong>Antoine D’Agata.<br />
        <strong><br />
        Bryan Derballa:</strong> Victor J. Blue.<br />
        <strong><br />
        Bobby Doherty: </strong>“I probably learned the most from Grant Cornett. He is in control of everything. Technically and stylistically he knows what he wants and knows exactly how to achieve it. I had assisted photographers who barely knew how to use their cameras ... I admired the way that Grant took full responsibility for every detail of his shoot.”<br />
        <strong><br />
        Grant Harder: </strong>“One of the people I used to assist was Kevin Arnold. When I need a little advice, I know I can give him a call. He has helped me out with everything from quoting on commercial jobs to recommending a backpack for a heli-skiing assignment.”<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Theron Humphrey: </strong>“There is this fellow I met on the road, Michael O’Neal. He left a solid creative position at Apple to pursue photography because he couldn’t see waking up every morning and not taking photos, not sharing with the world what he loved. He’s this brilliant reminder that even a solid and steady paycheck won’t fill our souls.”<br />
        <strong><br />
        Kyle Johnson:</strong> Daniel Shea, Jake Stangel.<br />
        <strong><br />
        Zun Lee:</strong> Roy DeCarava, David Alan Harvey.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Phil Moore:</strong> Jerome Delay, Roberto Schmidt.<br />
        <strong><br />
        Greer Muldowney:</strong> Henry Horenstein.<br />
        <strong><br />
        Benjamin Rasmussen: </strong>Jake Stangel.<br />
        <strong><br />
        Carla Richmond: </strong>John Durant, Ethan Pines, Dana Smith, David Zaitz.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Jenny Riffle:</strong> Seth Thompson “has been a mentor in his commitment to his art. He takes his work very seriously and has always treated my work the same”; Jock Sturges “is very <br />
        generous and a great teacher. He makes sure that I am always learning while assisting him.”<br />
        <strong><br />
        Bryan Schutmaat: </strong>Peter Brown.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Marcus Smith: </strong>Gary Land, Parrish Lewis.<br />
        <strong><br />
        Ralph Smith:</strong> “When I was 17 years old, I managed to get an internship with Arnold Newman. He was in his early 80s at the time but still went to work five days a week. He loved what he did. Having the opportunity to be around&nbsp; him was incredible. <br />
        <br />
        “After college I moved to New York City [and] started working exclusively for still-life photographer Levi Brown. [Over five years] I got to see his business grow and evolve, it was an incredible learning experience.”<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Ilona Szwarc:</strong> Joel Meyerowitz.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Josh Wool:</strong> Frank Ockenfels III, Joshua Black Wilkins and Victoria Will.<br />

        <strong>Client:</strong> <em>Glamour</em><br />
        <strong> Photo Director:</strong> Suzanne Donaldson <br />
        <strong>Beauty Editor:</strong> Michaela Buratti<br />
        <br />
        Fashion and beauty photographer <a href="http://www.arthurbelebeau.com/BEAUTY/1/" target="_blank">Arthur Belebeau</a> likes to create “clean, graphic and dynamic images.” “When I look through the camera I always try to find the most graphic way to do it, either by filling up the frame or leaving negative space,” he says. <br />
        <br />
        For a <em><a href="http://www.glamour.com/" target="_blank">Glamour</a></em> magazine story about favorite beauty products for nails, lips, eyes and hair, he wanted to shoot tight close-ups of the models, which meant the compositions couldn’t be overly complicated, but he also needed to show the products in use. Belebeau says, “The hardest part was to create something graphic and poppy, and use all the tools and props that they gave me.” <br />
        <br />
        He wanted to keep the lighting fairly consistent for all four images, but made adjustments for each subject. For his tight shot of fingernails, Belebeau, who is based in New York City and shoots for clients like Saks Fifth Avenue, Dior Beauty, Dasani and L’Or&eacute;al Paris, decided to shoot macro shots, with his camera on a tripod about five inches from the hand model’s fingertips, rather than shooting wider and cropping the image to get the composition he wanted. “For the quality of the image, I try not to crop,” the photographer notes. <br />
        <strong><br />
        Logistics</strong><br />
        Belebeau photographed the story at New York City’s Sun Studios in a shooting space with a white cyclorama. Along with Belebeau and his assistants, Michaela Buratti, beauty editor at Glamour, was on the set with the models, stylists and a manicurist. The hand model rested her arm on a beauty table to keep it from moving, Belebeau recalls. “If she moved two inches, she was out of the frame.”<br />
        <br />
        Before any shoot, Belebeau typically sketches out ideas for each composition. Once he’s begun working, he’ll experiment: “Then I try for an accident.” In sketching the nail polish image, he wanted the hand model’s fingers to be crossed. “I started with just the fingers, and then I started to add one element to it at a time—the product, the dripping.” The nail image was the last shot of the day. “I remember I had to shoot about 400 frames until something started happening in the image,” he says. An assistant put too much nail polish on the applicator, and it dripped. Belebeau recalls that at the moment it happened, Buratti, who was watching on a monitor, screamed. “I thought: That’s what I’m looking for,” Belebeau says. He had the assistant duplicate the drip ten to 15 more times, letting it fall just short of the end of the model’s finger so her French manicure wouldn’t have to be redone. After several more shots, he recalls, “We all went and had a drink.” <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Lighting</strong><br />
        Belebeau planned to use the same basic setup for all four shots. He photographed his subjects about eight feet from the cyc wall, which he lit using strobes with umbrellas placed on light trees—“basically c-stands with lights pounding on the background,” Belebeau explains. <br />
        <br />
        To get what he calls his “signature, poppy lighting,” Belebeau combines soft lights, either diffused or bounced off of white foam core, which flatter the skin, and hard lights, “so it looks poppy,” he says.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        On all the shots, he used Profoto lights on 2400 watt-second packs. His diffused light was a large softbox that was usually behind him. “It was the same lighting throughout the day but I had to adapt the angles,” he says. “Because I was so close to the subject with my camera, sometimes I would create a shadow with my head or my camera.” <br />
        <p>
        To add contrast to the image of shiny nail polish, he also used a single bare head that was placed three to four feet from his subject. On larger beauty shots, he notes, “I’ll use more than one hard light. I’ll put one behind the model, for example, to add highlights to her hair.” </p>

        <br />
        <strong>Camera </strong><br />
        Belebeau shot with a <a href="/Camera-Review-Canon-5887.shtml">Canon EOS 5D Mark III</a> tethered to two monitors: one for the digital tech, and one for the beauty editor. He photographed the fingernails with a macro f/2.8 100mm lens. “It eats up a lot of your light so you have to open your lens maybe a half-stop or a stop,” he says. To catch the motion of the drip, he shot at 1/160 of a second. <br />
        <br />
        When he was shooting the lips, he experimented with macro extension tubes that allowed him to try different lenses while focusing closely on the model’s mouth. He took the image that ran in the magazine on a 50mm lens with a macro extension tube. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Post-Production</strong><br />
        Belebeau has worked with Denise Ierardi at <a href="http://www.451imaging.com/" target="_blank">451 Imaging Ltd</a>. in New York City on almost all his assignments for the past ten years. “When you work with someone so long, communication is easy,” he says. “She knows what the client is looking for, and what kind of direction we’re aiming for.” Because the retouching on the images was limited to “color and a few small things,” Belebeau says, he first sent Glamour’s editors his selection of five to six favorite takes for each of the four photos, then had Ierardi clean up and color correct the images they chose to run. <br />
        <br />
        Belebeau adds, “I loved it because they picked my first choices.” The four images were published last year in a four-page layout in <em>Glamour.</em><br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        From <a target="_blank" href="http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&amp;VF=MAGO31_10_VForm&amp;ERID=24KL53T_6">Antoine D’Agata</a>’s perspective, life is most intense when lived in close proximity to death. For this reason he’s chosen to make most of his photographic and film work at the margins of society: in the street, among sex workers, drug addicts, and the impoverished in cities from Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and Sao Paulo and Salvador Da Bahia, Brazil.<br />
        <br />
        “These spaces where sex, pleasure, pain, fear come close and contaminate each other, this is exactly the type of territory I’m looking for,” D’Agata says.<br />
        <br />
        His black-and-white and color images primarily depict intense sexual encounters, heavy drug use, and physical and emotional pain. Through his long exposures and use of motion blur, his subjects often appear ecstatic, demonic, possessed. Many of his images are raw and explicit, full of naked bodies that tangle and merge.<br />
        <br />
        D’Agata does not simply pass through this “night world” he depicts; he lives in it for long periods, he told <em>PDN</em> in February during a wide-ranging interview about his work. He states openly that he is a drug addict and that he has relationships that are “physical, emotional, sexual, whatever, with most of the people I photograph.” In this night world, people take risks with drugs, promiscuous sex, self-mutilation or other violent acts, to wrest some control and vitality from a marginal existence, D’Agata says. “Because they have nothing, their only choice is to be alive and to feel and to exist in very basic and instinctive ways.” This self-inflicted “violence of the night,” as D’Agata calls it, arises from the systemic, “more economic, institutional” violence that marginalizes people, often from birth. Even before he became a photographer, D’Agata made the choice to live among the disenfranchised, a choice that is both personal and political.<br />
        <br />
        “From the very beginning, from well before I started photography, I always went to a very specific place where I felt I had to go, because I felt this was my duty as a citizen to be there and to understand and to share and be a part of it,” D’Agata says, noting that he spent more than a decade living a “street life.” <br />
        <br />
        He turned to photography not because he wanted to raise awareness about the lives of sex workers or others at the fringes of society, but because he felt life was lived most intensely among them. Photography gave him a reason to be there and enough money that he could continue traveling. “My point in the end is not to show the viewer or to remind them that that [marginal] life exists. My point is to be alive,” D’Agata says. “This is my first aim, this is what I’ve been doing for many years, just to be as alive as possible.” D’Agata says he’s had no permanent home for nearly a decade.<br />
        <br />
        Convincing his subjects to allow him to make these photographs comes down to trust, which he builds over time. He repeatedly returns to specific places where he’s built “long friendships,” and participates fully in the world he depicts. “Sometimes I spend weeks [there] before taking pictures,” he says. “Life always comes first.” <br />
        <br />
        Drugs also help form connections with his subjects. “When you are part of this scene, photography just doesn’t matter anymore, it’s just a detail. If you trust somebody enough to [risk going] to jail for many years,” he says, alluding to the penalty for illegal drug use, “photography doesn’t mean anything.” <br />
        <br />
        People will often test you in some way, he says, by asking you to take a risk, to see if you “are willing to be as desperate and daring” as they are. “If you are ready to lose everything, people will give you everything, and people will take you much further than you want to go, and you will take people further.” <br />
        <br />
        D’Agata has been labeled a voyeur and pornographer by some, and much worse by others. And yet the intensity with which he pursues life, and the lengths he goes to in order to be a part of the world he depicts, draws the respect of many photographers.<br />
        <br />
        “The questions that he poses are: How deeply do you engage and can you engage, and for whom are you engaging?” says fellow Magnum photographer Susan Meiselas. “I think those are really important, ongoing questions that every [photographer] answers in their own way.”<br />
        <br />
        He has been widely recognized and celebrated for his work. (He is equally dismissive of criticism and praise, saying both “make you weak in some ways.”) In 2001 he won the Ni&eacute;pce Prize for young photographers in France. He’s published several books and has exhibited his work widely in Europe. (While he’s spoken and worked in the United States, his photos have yet to be exhibited here.) In 2004 he became a Magnum nominee, and was voted a full member in 2008. <em>The Cambodian Room: Situations with Antoine D’Agata</em>, a documentary about him, was released in 2009. D’Agata has also released several films, and another documentary is in the works. <br />
        <br />
        His retrospective book, <em>Anticorps</em>, won the Rencontres d’Arles 2013 Author Book Award; this month, Prestel will release the English translation, <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.photoeye.com/bookstore/citation.cfm?catalog=PX230&amp;i=&amp;i2=">Antibodies</a></em>, which includes work from his year as a photojournalism student up through 2012.<br />
        <br />
        Born in Marseille, France, in 1961, D’Agata had no aspirations to be a photographer or an artist as a youth. Approaching 30, he was “torn down, tired, broken by years and years of street life,” he says. Living in New York City and working in a sweatshop, he was urged by people close to him to study at the International Center of Photography. “I was just trying to survive, mentally, emotionally, physically,” he recalls. Joan Liftin, then the director of the ICP photojournalism program, accepted him as “some kind of experiment,” he says, “because I had so much [life] experience, and most young photographers don’t.” Liftin, however, recalls that D’Agata’s “intelligence [had] shown through” in his application essay.<br />
        <br />
        That photography even occurred to him as a possibility was thanks to his friend Raphael, a photographer who was dying of AIDS when the two traveled to Mexico. Throughout the trip D’Agata noticed his friend photographing constantly. “It was shocking in a way,” he says. “You know you are going to die and you keep spending hours and days pushing on the button. I think I realized, maybe in an unconscious way, that photography was a good way to hang onto life, to be more alive.” <br />
        <br />
        It’s often noted that at ICP D’Agata studied with Nan Goldin and Larry Clark, two artists known for their intimate, sometimes shocking images of their friends. However Liftin, who remains friends with D’Agata, recalls that his cityscapes and landscapes were “particularly strong,” and that his work made a marked improvement during his second semester.<br />
        <br />
        Morten Andersen, who studied with D’Agata at ICP during the 1990-91 year and has seen the photographer work, recalls a trip they made to Mexico during a school break. They ended up in Boy’s Town, a commercial district of bars and brothels in Nuevo Laredo, and D’Agata’s photographs shifted. “He found his subject and way of working on that trip,” Andersen recalls.<br />
        <br />
        “To me all these matters of esthetics, color, blur, techniques, of course I have to take it into consideration, but I don’t really care,” D’Agata says. He says that for years he would walk around with black-and-white and color film and shoot both, not “as a function of considering the subject,” but because he wanted “linguistic breaks, which mixing both of them in the same story would create.” He’s shifted between camera formats for the same reason, he says. D’Agata wants to emphasize the individual images, “to respect the singleness of each image, of each moment.” For this reason, he’s also shifted photographic styles.<br />
        <br />
        “Every time I feel like I’m getting closed or I’m [becoming] a prisoner of my own habits, I break,” he explains. “I try to break again and again all types of things which could close me down, and to stay free from this.”<br />
        <br />
        In <em>Antibodies</em>, D’Agata’s sequence shifts between his “night world” photographs, which include the images he made in Mexico as an ICP student, and images of conflict. We see photos of soldiers, barrier walls, destroyed structures, and street fighting he took in Israel, Palestine and the West Bank; of crumbling buildings in Marseille and Alexandria, Egypt, and destroyed homes in Bosnia; of the city of Oswiecim, Poland, and nearby Auschwitz concentration camp; of migrants in Sangatte, France; of mobile homes in North Dakota; of empty, makeshift beds in Phnom Penh, or of small prison cells in Tripoli, Libya. There are close-up headshots of people in Georgia, Montenegro, New York City and Siem Reap, Cambodia. <br />
        <br />
        In his book, D’Agata often presents these photographs of sociological, political and economic issues as typologies. The images, which D’Agata has made on assignment, as grant-supported personal work and while working on Magnum group projects, seem like polar opposites of the instinctive, extreme images for which he is most known.<br />
        <br />
        “What might strike people looking at the work is that it’s kind of schizophrenic,” D’Agata says of these “two visions” in his photography. What connects them, he says, is his interest in depicting the violence of the world with a visual language that is true to his own experience. “Photographically I try to invent a point of view which reflects my own position,” he explains. “If I photograph war and I’m scared, I try to give a sense of this fear. If I’m bored in some situation, I try to shoot boredom.”<br />
        <br />
        In the book and his retrospective exhibition at Le Bal gallery in Paris, D’Agata says, “You can see I’m always trying to confront these two very different languages.” Though the photographic esthetics differ, they depict “sides of the same violence,” he says, “which is the violence of the world.” The political underpinnings of D’Agata’s life and work are “never spoken about,” he says, but in considering these two different bodies of work together, his political stance becomes clearer.<br />
        <br />
        The violence that exists on the margins is “the world I’ve been living in for 30 years now,” he says. “And I don’t think it’s right, this violence, but it exists … it’s a violence which is part of me, and I photograph it in the most extreme way, and for years I’ve been trying to find ways to be more and more inside [it].” In recent work D’Agata has put himself in the frame, making himself a subject. “This is as far as I can go in this violence of the world,” he says.<br />
        <br />
        The book includes a series of stream-of-consciousness texts D’Agata wrote. They range from explicit accounts of drug use and intoxication, relationships and sex, to nuanced delineations of his personal philosophy. In one text he lays out a dystopian vision in which the person of means is “robbed of his existence, he merely complies with a vast scheme of indoctrination and lives behind walls, under the surveillance of cameras, hires guards, buys weapons, protects himself against all dangers visible and invisible, dispersed but omnipresent, familiar and unknown.” This, he says, is the antithesis of the vibrancy of life at the margins.<br />
        <br />
        “I find more beauty and more courage and more strength and more intensity in these specific worlds, but people who have this life, they don’t choose it,” he explains. “I’m in a very complex situation because I am there by choice. I have this experience and I can be in and out and I survive … just moving keeps me alive. And they have no choice and they die like flies, and so in real life, outside of the pictures, I do my best to pick them up.”<br />
        <br />
        “I know he cares about people,” says Andersen. “If I didn’t know him at all, I’m not sure what I would think [of his work].” He adds, “I’m not sure if I like it or not, but it has a strong impact on me … You don’t forget these pictures.”<br />
        <br />
        Photography both enables and complicates D’Agata’s life. Occasional assignments, and print and book sales give him the financial freedom to keep moving. Yet putting the Antibodies book and exhibition together required him to spend nearly a year in Paris, which “pulls me down and weakens me again,” he says. “And it’s been hard since to go back” to life on the margins. <br />
        <br />
        D’Agata describes his personal life as “a mess.” His four children “know what’s happening, but we don’t speak about it. They don’t want any insight, and I don’t want to share this with them.” &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Yet photography has given D’Agata “freedom and strength,” he says. “For many years I was like a sponge, I kept absorbing something which I could not digest.” He adds, “Photography is the only art you cannot create from inside your head or inside your studio, you have to be in the world, you have to be part of it and you have to act in it, and you have to be responsible for this position. Photography has forced me again and again and again to push myself out there and be responsible for every single move, every single act. It gave me everything.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        Some of the emerging photographers chosen for <em>PDN</em>’s 30 issues in the last five years have been experimenting with video almost as long as they’ve been taking pictures. Many who entered professional photography around the time that digital SLRs gained HD video capabilities see moving and still images as equally important tools for their visual storytelling. But to land assignments as a director or a cinematographer, most had to acquire the skills, experience and vision that came from producing their own video projects from start to finish.<br />
        <br />
        “No books or tutorials can match the simple act of doing and learning from your mistakes along the way,” says photojournalist <a target="_blank" href="http://ackermangruber.com/">Jenn Ackerman</a> who, with her partner, Tim Gruber, made their first video as part of a documentary project on mental health issues in prisons; they are now being asked to bid on jobs requiring only video. <a target="_blank" href="http://kylealexander.com/">Kyle Alexander</a>, who has directed videos for many of his still clients, including O’Neill, says, “Technical things you can learn about the craft of filmmaking from a book or videos, but being a good director is more about your personality, I think.” Directing demands a passion for your subject, the ability to work with talent and crew, and “extreme patience,” he says, adding, “everything takes forever on a set.”<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Learn by Doing</strong><br />
        Advertising and editorial photographer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tobiashutzler.com/">Tobias Hutzler</a>’s first forays into video were small, self-funded projects he made as an undergraduate. “The constraint of a very limited budget was a fantastic challenge,” he says. “I learned to improvise, condense, focus, and work creatively with very limited production and technical setups—a very similar approach to a still shoot.” The experience helped him hone his style. “Rather than getting caught up in gear and technical aspects, at the beginning I needed to learn about myself, [and] listen to what I have to say.”<br />
        <br />
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nickhallphotography.com/">Nick Hall</a>: “Jump in, make massive mistakes and enjoy the epic learning curve.”<br />
        <br />
        Kyle Alexander: “Write a small script or treatment, do all the parts you can: gaff, sound, shoot, wardrobe and edit. It might be awful but you will learn something.”<br />
        <strong><br />
        Find the Right Partners</strong><br />
        “Coming from photography, directing was a new thing,” says fashion photographer <a target="_blank" href="http://bonduke.com/">Bon Duke</a>, who used DSLRs to shoot his own videos, then showed his work to a production house, which hired him to shoot with their teams. “I have to really give it to my producers and especially my cinematographers for really believing in me when I needed help,” he says. They “showed me things I needed to understand or learn.” <br />
        <br />
        Tobias Hutzler says that posting videos not only helped him find clients, it also introduced him to some of his collaborators. “By publishing work you gain recognition, and people want to work with you.” He worked with the production house B2Pro in New York City to make his video “Balance,” which was picked up by <em>TIME</em> and went viral. &nbsp;<br />
        <strong><br />
        Be Prepare</strong>d<br />
        Bon Duke says one of the most important lessons he’s learned is the value of planning and storyboarding before shooting. He considers his sketchbook as essential as any gear he brings to a set. &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Nick Hall: “I think the most important thing to learn, once you have some experience under your belt, is that pre-production is everything. If you have locked down the moving parts as much as possible prior to being on set with actors, talent and crew waiting, then there can be space for creativity.”<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Know What You Need: Gear</strong><br />
        Photographers we interviewed for this article have used a wide range of cameras on assignments. Among them: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.arri.com/camera/alexa/">ARRI Alexa</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicpocketcinemacamera">Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera</a>, <a href="/Camera-Review-Canon-5887.shtml">Canon EOS 5D Mark III</a>, <a href="/Camera-Review-Canon-9874.shtml">Canon EOS 7D</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://gopro.com/cameras">GoPro</a> cameras, <a href="/Camera-Review-Nikon-5617.shtml">Nikon D4</a>, <a href="/Camera-Review-Nikon-7007.shtml">Nikon D600</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.red.com/products">RED</a> cameras.<br />
        <br />
        Photojournalist <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jaredmoossy.com/">Jared Moossy</a>, who has worked as a cinematographer for CNN, Al Jazeera, HBO and Bank of America, says, “I use a variety of cameras from the Canon DSLRs to the C series to GoPros to … the Alexa and RED cameras.” He adds, “Whether it’s run-and-gun documentary work or commercial work, each one has its advantages or disadvantages.”<br />
        <br />
        Jenn Ackerman: “A lot of our projects are … documentary in nature so the [Canon EOS] <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/professional/products/professional_cameras/cinema_eos_cameras/eos_c100">C100</a> is also a great fit for the way we work, which often means being quick and nimble.”<br />
        <br />
        Besides cameras, what other gear have photographers found valuable? <br />
        <br />
        Nick Hall: “For smaller productions, my 1m glider has been indispensable. No matter where you are, you can put the camera on the glider and get a mini-dolly shot.”<br />
        Jenn Ackerman: “Audio equipment including the lavalieres and shotgun mics.”<br />
        <br />
        Whether photographers rent or own their biggest pieces of equipment depends on the types of jobs they shoot. <br />
        <br />
        Tobias Hutzler: “I rent almost all of the gear for productions. I travel a lot for shoots within the U.S. or to Europe and Asia, and shipping would simply be too difficult. Renting also gives me the freedom to experiment, to use lights and setups I haven’t worked with before.”<br />
        <br />
        Jared Moossy: “I tend to rent my gear as a lot of [technology] is changing so quickly.”<br />
        <br />
        Jenn Ackerman: “We have always bought our equipment because we are often working on long-term personal projects that require that we have access to the same gear for long periods of time. “<br />
        <br />
        Kyle Alexander: “I own a basic kit: C-stands, apple boxes, sandbags, tripod, and sound gear and mics. It’s just nice to have all you need at the drop of a hat to go shoot.” <br />
        <strong><br />
        Know What You Need: Budget and Crew</strong><br />
        Photographers we interviewed have worked with crews ranging in size from two to 20. The bigger the budget, the more help you have on the set. <br />
        <br />
        “What I’m seeing now is an unfortunate equation where clients want their cameraman to be an all-in-one because of budgets, and the work is suffering,” says Jared Moossy. “If you start spreading yourself too thin, then you can’t fully concentrate on your job.”<br />
        <br />
        Bon Duke: “Make sure the concept you have, or the idea that the client has, is actually realistic within the budget. In the end, you don’t want to shoot yourself in the foot with an amazing concept that cannot be pulled off because of budget restraints.”<br />
        <br />
        Jared Moossy: “I sometimes run the audio myself, though I prefer there be someone to run that gauntlet … I think it is also really key to have an editor, because they are separate from the emotional ties of the project and can make the necessary and ruthless cutting choices … Plus, editing has its own set of skills and if you want high-quality work, you have to take the right steps.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        When <a href="http://www.nickhallphotography.com/" target="_blank">Nick Hall</a> got a three-week assignment to shoot a story for <em>Nature Conservancy</em> magazine about a project to restore sheep grazing grasslands in Patagonia, in southern Argentina, he figured the biggest challenge would be making pictures of sheep that weren’t, well, boring. “Everyone knows what a sheep looks like,” he says.<br />
        <br />
        Little did he realize how difficult it would be. He had envisioned majestic landscapes, but found grasslands flat to the horizon, like the ocean. The wind blew relentlessly, bending Hall’s light stands and grinding away at morale. And the sheep were not the docile animals Hall remembered from the UK, where he grew up. In Patagonia, he couldn’t get closer than a couple of hundred feet to any grazing sheep.<br />
        <br />
        “We tried all kinds of different things: herding; remote camera traps, which didn’t work very well; long lenses—all kinds of things I was never very happy with,” says Hall, who was chosen as a <em>PDN</em>’s 30 in 2011.<br />
        <br />
        But he delivered anyway. “I knew there would be awesome visual opportunities and Nick would do a great job, which of course he did,” says Melissa Ryan, director of photography for <em>Nature Conservancy </em>magazine. In remote locales, she says, “There are often logistical challenges that require patience and good humor because it doesn’t always work out the way you planned. His amazing skill, humor and good attitude is worth millions to me.”<br />
        <br />
        The story, called “<a href="http://magazine.nature.org/features/shear-salvation.xml" target="_blank">Reviving Patagonia</a>,” appeared on the cover of the September/October 2013 issue of <em>Nature Conservancy</em>. The Nature Conservancy (TNC) has undertaken the grasslands restoration project in partnership with the outdoor clothing brand Patagonia, Inc. and Ovis XXI, a local agricultural NGO. TNC and Ovis XXI are introducing new land management practices to sheep ranchers, with the goal of reversing damage to the grasslands. Patagonia, Inc. is providing seed money and a market for the sustainably raised wool.<br />
        <br />
        Hall’s assignment brief called for landscapes, portraits, wildlife, livestock and reportage. “I feel like it’s a small sector of photographers who can do all of those things in an exceptional way. And Nick does it,” Ryan says. She also asked him to shoot video for a series of <a href="http://www.nature.org/photos-and-video/shear-salvation-videos.xml" target="_blank">behind-the-scenes vignettes</a> for <em>Nature Conservancy</em>’s iPad edition, but the still photography was Hall’s priority. <br />
        <br />
        Ryan has hired Hall to photograph several previous stories. Besides his skills as a photographer, she notes, he is knowledgeable about environmental and conservation issues “from the grassroots to the policy level.” Moreover, Ryan says, Hall manages to get on well with researchers, policy experts and other TNC partners who sometimes consider photographers a nuisance. <br />
        <br />
        Ryan provided Hall with a long list of possible portrait subjects and ranches where he might photograph sheep, wildlife and landscapes. “Melissa does a huge amount of leg work in advance, so it becomes a cherry-picking exercise for me, to pick the most beautiful places and characters,” Hall says. <br />
        <br />
        He flew to Patagonia with his assistant, <a target="_blank" href="http://oliverludlow.com/">Oliver Ludlow</a>, in December 2012. They rented a truck, and drove from ranch to ranch with program managers from both TNC and Ovis XXI. “It was quite a lot of driving, but it wasn’t difficult to get around,” Hall says. &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        It was summer in Patagonia, and because of its extreme southern latitude, Hall arose by 4:15 every morning to catch the early morning light, and worked until 9 or 10 every night. A chill wind, he says, “blew all day, every day.” By the third or fourth day, “your soul feels like a beaten, tattered flag. It takes it out of you.”<br />
        <br />
        He decided to shoot portraits outside, to connect his subjects to the landscape they were all working to save. And because the story was promoting a TNC project, Hall wanted the portraits more stylized than he might normally shoot on an editorial assignment. So he brought “a lean lighting kit,” including a <a target="_blank" href="http://profoto.com/">Profoto</a> umbrella, four Profoto heads, several medium and small softboxes, two power packs, stands and batteries. (He shot stills and video with a <a href="/Camera-Review-Nikon-5617.shtml">Nikon D4</a> camera; his assistant shot video with a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/eos_slr_camera_systems/eos_digital_slr_cameras/eos_5d_mark_ii">Canon EOS 5D Mark II</a>.)<br />
        <br />
        The stands were lightweight, and turned out to be no match for the wind. “They started to bend, so Oliver had to anchor them down to prevent them from breaking,” Hall says. <br />
        <br />
        Because the sheep were so elusive, Hall found it impossible to get the hero shot he imagined: a wide-angle close-up of sheep grazing toward the camera on fresh green grass, against an epic sky. About the best he was able to do out on the grasslands were some pictures of cute lambs huddling out of the wind among tufts of grass after they had become separated from their mothers. He also got some majestic shots of a herd of wild horses that were curious enough to let him approach.<br />
        <br />
        “I made up for what I didn’t get on the grasslands in unexpected ways with the farmers,” he says. “I made good pictures of ranchers tending to their sheep, sending them to market and shearing them. I was also able to set up location lights, and do quirky portraits in barns.”<br />
        <br />
        One of those portraits, showing two proud ranchers in a barn with a freshly shorn sheep, became the cover image. Outside the barn, where those same ranchers were tagging and castrating lambs, Hall saw an opportunity for an image he hadn’t anticipated.<br />
        <br />
        “The lambs were jumping very high in the air upon release, so I tried to capture a shot of a lamb in mid-air,” he says. He worked at it for several hours, lying all the while on the ground of an outdoor corral. “I finally got the image, and I got very intimate with more than a few sheep droppings,” Hall recounts.<br />
        <br />
        The wide-angle image, showing a lamb soaring across the corral, was a favorite of Ryan’s, and became the lead image of the story. More images from the project are displayed on Hall’s website. And as this issue of <em>PDN</em> was going to press, another story that Hall <a target="_blank" href="http://magazine.nature.org/features/giant-steppes.xml">shot last summer in Mongolia</a> appeared in the April/March 2014 issue of <em>Nature Conservancy</em>.<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        In its 142 years of publishing, the publishers and editors of <em><a href="http://www.popsci.com/" target="_blank">Popular Science</a></em> magazine have shown a fearlessness in changing the brand’s visual identity that’s somewhat akin to strapping on a jetpack. Since debuting in 1872, <em>Pop Sci</em>, now owned by Bonnier Corporation, has scrapped its logo 24 times; its overall look, more. A willingness to modernize itself seems to be part of <em>Popular Science</em>’s DNA—the magazine’s main beat is the future, after all, and its goal is to explain how breakthroughs in science and technology might alter the lives of its mass readership.<br />
        <br />
        For the first large-scale refresh of the 1.3-million circulation title in eight years, newly tapped Editor-in-Chief Cliff Ransom worked with Design Director Todd Detwiler and Photo Editor Thomas Payne to unify the magazine’s visual approach, beginning with the February 2014 issue. The magazine’s design had become somewhat fractured (the use of multiple logos, for instance) and the general feeling was that the disarray wasn’t serving the content well. The first step was a logo change. Detwiler hired type designers Gail Anderson and Joe Newton of Anderson Newton Design, well known for their “retro tendencies,” Detwiler says, to come up with a logo and branding that would nod gently to the magazine’s mid-century, flying-car heyday but push it forward into the future of tech. <br />
        <br />
        The visual changes get more interesting from there. The most noticeable change: the cover. Nearly all of <em>Popular Science</em>’s covers in recent years have been illustrated: cyber soldiers, rolling robots, levitating trains. “The illustrated covers were always something shiny and hard, something that looked like it was real but didn’t really exist. They were an intangible look at the future,” says Detwiler. “But the amount of money being spent [on] them was blowing our budget.” The solution: Hire a photographer to shoot every cover. <br />
        <br />
        In fact, <em>Popular Science</em> is now assigning more photography throughout the book. <br />
        <br />
        “When I got here two years ago, we were shooting maybe 50 percent of the magazine from issue to issue; now we’re shooting almost 85 percent,” says Payne, adding that the rest is a combination of stock photography, manufacturer-supplied images and illustrations. The result of having more photographs commissioned specifically for <em>Popular Science</em> is a more cohesive look and feel. “The more you shoot of the magazine, the better it will look because you control what you can and cannot do,” says Detwiler. <br />
        <br />
        The rise of photography at <em>Pop Sci</em> can be traced to the magazine’s evolving editorial direction. In a quest for new subscribers, there is an emphasis on relatability—how an upcoming development in science (or a current one) might affect the reader. That means more portraits and more personality profiles. The first cover of the redesigned February issue shows Olympic gold medalist skier Ted Ligety, shot by New York City-based photographer <a href="http://www.travisrathbone.com/" target="_blank">Travis Rathbone</a> in an homage to Leonardo da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man. The story is called “Engineering the Ideal Olympian,” and covers the technologies used to give U.S. athletes an edge on their global competitors. Rathbone photographed Ligety in a ski suit that has a shark-skin-like coating and precision-placed zippers to reduce drag. It’s the same suit Ligety would go into competition with, and be seen wearing by millions of fans tuning in to watch the Winter Olympic Games. The article explains a bit of the scientific backstory behind it. <br />
        <br />
        The March cover story focuses on a broader issue: the “science of sleep.” After kicking around far-out ideas, some inspired by Philip K. Dick novels, some including a live sheep, the magazine’s editors came to the conclusion that the cover would be a man in bed, yawning, holding a glowing tablet—speaking to a modern, gadget-addled lifestyle that’s not entirely conducive to sleep. It’s a topic most <em>Pop Sci</em> readers have first-hand knowledge of, and didn’t call for a futuristic illustration. <br />
        <br />
        Rathbone, who also shot the March cover, says that when Detwiler and Payne talked over the concept with him before the shoot, “the big point that they impressed upon me is the idea that we’re reflecting what’s happening right now. They’re trying to put a little bit more ‘popular’ into <em>Popular Science</em>.” <br />
        <br />
        He added that the pair chose to go for a moody shot with dark tonalities—a rarity for a consumer magazine. “I think it was a bold choice, and will pop out on the newsstand,” he says. <br />
        <br />
        Though Rathbone shot two covers back to back, Payne says that he would definitely consider other cover photographers. “We have a great back-and-forth, and I like the consistency, but we’re open to others shooting it.” <br />
        <br />
        Beyond the cover, a revised front of book will feature more prominent photography as well. The NOW section, which focuses on new developments in gadgets and tech, generally features a half-dozen product shots per month; the rest are pick-up images, using studio product photography provided by a manufacturer. Every product that’s assigned to be photographed will generally be shot by a photographer based in New York City, where <em>Pop Sci</em>’s editorial offices are located, so that Payne or one of the magazine’s creative representatives can be on hand. “If it’s a lawnmower or a lightbulb, we’ll do something cool with it,” says Payne. The rotating cast of photographers he’s used for the front of book since before the redesign has included <a href="http://samkaplan.com/" target="_blank">Sam Kaplan</a>, <a href="http://jonathonkambouris.com/" target="_blank">Jonathon Kambouris</a>, <a href="http://www.clairebenoist.com/" target="_blank">Claire Benoist</a> and <a href="http://brianklutch.com/" target="_blank">Brian Klutch</a>. “Everyone brings their creative mix to it. No one photographer shoots the entire front of book every month,” says Payne. “I’m always looking to work new talent into the mix, too.” <br />
        <br />
        Flipping forward, a new section called NEXT covers ideas and innovations. Whereas the NOW section shots are more literal, NEXT’s are more conceptual: a February story on concussions featured a Sam Kaplan shot of watermelons colliding. The section also covers personalities. A Q &amp; A in the February issue featured Dave Lange of FedEx, who’s in charge of handling the logistics of shipping anything that requires a chartered plane: whales, pandas, enormous emergency famine relief shipments, 80,000 sea turtle eggs, the <em>Titanic</em>’s hull. Lange works in Nashville, and the visual concept of a NEXT Q &amp; A is that the subject should be shot in his or her workspace. Looking for someone based in the South who could do a “Martin Schoeller-style close-up, almost,” Payne searched the online photographer directory <a href="http://www.wonderfulmachine.com/photographers/any/Tampa%2C+Florida/mi/27.95782/-82.424193/1/" target="_blank">Wonderful Machine</a> and came across the work of <a href="http://www.jacobslaton.com/" target="_blank">Jacob Slaton</a>, a portrait photographer in Little Rock, Arkansas. Slaton drove several hours to Nashville for the shoot. He photographed Lange in his office wearing a pressed dress shirt, coffee cup in hand, sitting in front of a map of the world. There’s a Walter Mitty sensibility to the picture, which contrasts Lange’s banal office world to the weird, adventurous problems he works on solving day to day. It’s a striking portrait, and funny. “The best photographers are able to see in an instant the personality of someone and extract it,” Detwiler says.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        The secondary message of that shot: The breakthroughs <em>Popular Science</em> covers can happen anywhere, so if you’re a photographer located outside New York City, Los Angeles and the other big photo markets, Payne may come searching for you. “I’m looking to find great photographers everywhere—Atlanta, Tennessee, North Dakota,” says Payne. “More and more, we’re finding that there are great photographers in smaller markets that, for our needs, work out great.” <br />
        <br />
        How does Payne look for photographers around the country? Wonderful Machine is a go-to, as is <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/PhotoServe328.shtml" target="_blank">PhotoServe</a>, he says. “There might be a great photographer that’s not on them, but I’ve had good luck so far,” he says. Another way he finds photographers is through old-fashioned printed promos mailed to his office. “It doesn’t matter if it’s just one striking image or several, I keep a huge stack of them in my office and periodically flip through them. I’m more inclined to keep them if they’re not from New York City.” He adds, “And I meet with as many new names as I can in-house.” <br />
        <br />
        The photography in <em>Pop Sci</em>’s feature well remains a mix of more conceptual themes (a story on dark matter featured a photograph of a sphere in fog, for example) and more literal ones (a story on face detection opened with surveillance camera images stitched together). But there will be at least one major difference in the magazine moving forward: “We’ll always have the promise of the cover pay off inside,” says Detwiler. Previously, the illustrated cover might have been the only time the image was seen, and the cover concept might not even have been a feature, Detwiler explains. To demonstrate how the magazine has changed, Detwiler points to the February Olympics feature. Rathbone’s da Vinci-style cover image of Ligety is followed up inside with a story opener that’s a splashy spread from the same shoot: a profile portrait of the skier tucked for downhill battle. The typography is muted; the photograph shines. <br />
        <br />
        Clearly the creative team has more control since the redesign. But they have not been given carte blanche yet. Because <em>Popular Science</em> is the biggest brand at Bonnier, “We can’t just do anything we want. Everything we do is calculated,” says Detwiler. “But if we stay within our framework, we’ve definitely got the ability to cool it up,” adds Payne.<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        When outdoor clothing and equipment brand <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thenorthface.com/en_US/index.html">The North Face</a> wanted a way to promote a ski expedition they sponsored to Mount Hunter in Alaska’s Denali National Park &amp; Preserve, they turned to <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.powdermag.com/">Powder Magazine</a></em> to produce a branded, editorial-style multimedia feature that combined photography, video and text into an interactive experience.<br />
        <br />
        The digital feature, titled “<a target="_blank" href="http://tnf-flipbook.powdermag.com/">Frozen in Time</a>,” was released by Powder in December 2013. The story follows professional skiers Ian McIntosh, Angel Collinson and Johnny Collinson as they spend a couple of weeks in April 2013 skiing previously untouched lines near the Denali base camp from which mountaineers access the highest peaks in North America. <br />
        <br />
        The multimedia “flipbook,” as <em>Powder</em> calls it, features <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adamclarkphoto.com/">Adam Clark</a>’s photographs, video by Sherpas Cinema and text by <em>Powder</em> editor John Stifter, as well as maps, journal entries from the athletes and other design elements. The piece also allows readers to see and shop for The North Face products that were used during the expedition.<br />
        <br />
        Each year The North Face funds roughly a dozen expeditions for their sponsored athletes, and the photography and video created during those expeditions provides the bulk of the content the brand uses in its advertising, marketing and communications, says Aaron Carpenter, The North Face’s vice president of global marketing. <br />
        <br />
        The flipbook about the Denali ski expedition that Powder proposed appealed to The North Face because it used new technology, and combined great photography, video and storytelling while seamlessly featuring their products. “That’s the ultimate, if we can combine a great story along with the product,” Carpenter says.<br />
        <br />
        That the flipbook was a Powder production sponsored by The North Face, rather than a North Face production released by the brand, made a difference as well. The distinction may sound subtle, but as Carpenter notes, working with media partners like Powder changes how potential readers view a story. When readers turn to <em>Powder</em> or other magazines, “they’re really in the mindset of, ‘I want a story and I want to go deep on it,’” Carpenter says, whereas if The North Face releases photo and video via their own social channels, “it actually doesn’t reach that many people” despite their large audience, which includes more than three million followers on Facebook.<br />
        <br />
        Once their agreement with The North Face was in place,<em> Powder </em>treated the creation of the flipbook “basically like another magazine” they were producing, says <em>Powder </em>editor John Stifter. The magazine’s staff, which includes longtime Director of Photography David Reddick, created and edited all of the material, including Clark’s photographs and video clips provided by <a target="_blank" href="https://sherpascinema.com/">Sherpas Cinema</a>; designed the 51 slides that went into the flipbook; then handed the production over to <a target="_blank" href="http://kindmags.com/">Kindmags</a>, a British company that produces digital magazines and other media. About a month later, <em>Powder</em> published “Frozen in Time.”<br />
        <br />
        It’s the first time <em>Powder</em> has produced a multimedia flipbook, though they previously created one static flipbook “as a way to feature photography” outside of the space limitations of print, Stifter says. (Other magazines operating under <em>Powder</em>’s parent company, GrindMedia, have also created digital magazines or other features in this style, which gave the Powder team some knowledge of the process.)<br />
        <br />
        As readers click through the pages of the flipbook, which they can view on a computer, tablet or smartphone, Clark’s action images, portraits and detail shots are the entry points into each part of the story. <br />
        <br />
        A veteran of the ski industry who sold his first images to Powder in the late 1990s, Clark is on retainer with The North Face, and is also a senior photographer for <em>Powder</em>. Often the athletes will pitch expedition ideas to The North Face and the brand will decide on the photographer, but in this case McIntosh recommended Clark—the two had traveled to Denali together before and had “scoped out some of the lines that we were shooting and skiing,” Clark says.<br />
        <br />
        The expeditions are great to work on, Clark explains, because The North Face “[tries] to give you as much time as possible to get as much done as possible,” and they also “pay well” because they “realize it’s a lot of time and it’s dangerous.”<br />
        <br />
        The difficulty of being a ski photographer often comes from long hikes with heavy backpacks, but on this trip the cold presented the greatest challenge. Clark says it was in the neighborhood of -40 degrees the first night. It was also challenging “to keep that creativity alive but also to be safe and secure.” <br />
        <br />
        The crew was working with guide Fred Collins, and Clark asked him questions about where to go and where not to go. But, he says, it was ultimately on him to decide “if I’m going to take two more steps forward to get that perfect angle … It’s all about having experience in the mountains and hopefully making a good decision.”<br />
        <br />
        Coordinating with the cinematographers was also important, Clark says. He’s often after wide-angle, tight shots of the skiers, but has to be careful to stay out of the frame of the video cameras.<br />
        <br />
        Clark went on the expedition with a shot list from The North Face, but also documented the trip as if it were an editorial assignment, something the brand appreciates. “They want more than just the hero stuff, they want all the details of these athletes’ lives,” Clark explains. Winter camping gave him a chance to make lifestyle images and portraits as he lived with the athletes in tents for a couple of weeks. “I love that aspect of it,” he says. The long days of the arctic spring also meant golden hour stretched to two or three hours. By the end of the trip they were shooting sunset skiing at 10 PM.<br />
        <br />
        The <em>Powder</em> staff was “careful” in designing and programming the flipbook, wary that readers might be put off by heavy-handed branding, a caution The North Face appreciated. “We were trying to be as careful as possible with those ‘buy now’ links and our North Face coverage,” says Stifter, adding that the brand “was not asking [us] to be over the top in their branding, they wanted it to be subtle as well.” <br />
        <br />
        A branded feature like this, Carpenter says, is “really good at reaching our most involved consumers. We call them hardcore achievers: people who really are getting outdoors and pushing their personal limits … [This type of project is] really effective with a smaller group of really influential people and loyal people.”<br />
        <br />
        “It’s exceeded my expectations in terms of views,” Stifter tells <em>PDN</em>, noting that at press time in late December, the flipbook had “been viewed just shy of 300,000 times, and the time spent analytic is 4 minutes and 28 seconds, so people are flipping through it which is really awesome.”<br />
        <br />
        Clark says he’s received “a ton of great feedback from all different parts of the outdoor industry,” from athletes to people working on the marketing side of the business.<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <a href="http://www.jocelynlee.com/" target="_blank">Jocelyn Lee</a> shoots primarily portraits, taking a conceptual approach that strives to elevate them to fine art. Her goal is to communicate ideas not only about her subjects, but about the world in which they live.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Lee, a Yale University graduate who taught at Princeton University for ten years, lives in New York and Maine. Over the course of almost 30 years, she has established a name for herself primarily by photographing women and girls, exhibiting portraits that challenge the norms of female beauty at Pace/MacGill Gallery in New York City, Rose Gallery in Santa Monica, California, and Flatland Gallery in Amsterdam. &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Her agenda isn’t heavy handed, but throughout her career Lee has sought to expand and explore conventional definitions of female beauty. “We are all imperfect in profound and complicated ways,” says Lee. “Women have a particularly difficult time with aging because youth and perceived notions of beauty are prioritized in our culture and in being so demand the complete obfuscation of a giant population of women.”&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Inspired by the casual, girl-watching photographs of Garry Winogrand in his 1975 series “Women Are Beautiful,” which she says she greatly admires, Lee has spent her career photographing her friends and family as well as paid models, exploring all body types and ages and stages of life. Her portraits, often nude or semi-nude, include very pregnant young women, nursing mothers, babies, little girls, budding adolescents, tattooed and pierced teens, middle-aged women, older women, women with the wrinkles of age and the scars of surgery, even her own mother as she lay dying. &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        “The concept behind this body of work is to expand the notion of female beauty and to add new images to our cultural image bank of the female body,” Lee explains. “I’m also interested in the psychological portrait. These pictures are as much about the internal lives of these women as [they are] about the external body.”&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        So while Winogrand took a street photographer’s approach to stealing glimpses of young women, Lee takes a portrait photographer’s more deliberate approach to her subjects, selecting indoor and outdoor environments to pose them in and photographing them with a Mamiya RB67 film camera. She scans her negatives and makes pigment prints, typically about 24 x 20 inches.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        “Although Lee is interested in photographing specific people at different stages of life, each portrait also provides a broader opportunity to reflect on our shared humanity,” notes the website of the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery where Lee was featured in the 2008 to 2009 “<a href="http://www.npg.si.edu/exhibit/feature/visit.html" target="_blank">Portraiture Now: Feature Photography</a>” exhibition with Katy Grannan, Ryan McGinley, Steve Pyke, Martin Schoeller and Alec Soth.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        In 2011, some of Lee’s portraits were published along with a selection of landscapes as <em><a href="http://www.photoeye.com/bookstore/citation.cfm?catalog=ZE138&i=&i2=" target="_blank">Nowhere But Here</a></em> (Steidl). In 2013, she received a New York Foundation for the Arts grant to help with the publication of a much larger selection to be called Women &amp; Girls.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Where Winogrand’s photographs embodied the male gaze and all the flirting heterosexual tension that it implies, Lee is after something quite different.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        “I want these portraits to convey love,” she says. “I want them to convey tenderness and compassion. I want to make pictures that feel that they were made, at least in part, by someone who loves the body that sits before them.”&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        While the immediate subject of Lee’s “Women &amp; Girls” portrait series is the female body, the subtext is aging. Because she has photographed some women repeatedly for almost three decades, her photographs portray girls becoming women and women becoming elderly.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        “It is about the individual in time,” Lee says, “short time, the moments it takes to make a single portrait, and long time, over years or a lifespan.”&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        And what she has learned from this long-term portrait project is that photography has a narrative all its own.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        “The default of being a photographer,” says Lee, “is that if you take photographs all your life, you end up photographing your life.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        Photographs are inextricably connected to memory, and our memories are, in many ways, the sum of our lives. We grew up looking through photo albums at the people our parents were before they became our parents, and at images of ourselves from before we can even remember. We keep photos of events from long ago, showing people we have not thought of in years.<br />
        <br />
        <em><a target="_blank" href="http://jleav.net/works/native-son-2014/">Native Son</a></em>, the first book by photographer <a target="_blank" href="http://jleav.net/">Joe Leavenworth</a>, is a quietly compelling work that operates at the intersection of memory and identity. All of the photographs were taken in the American South—specifically in Georgia—and represent the artist’s attempt to explore and connect with the place where he was born. If that sounds fairly conventional, here is the catch: Leavenworth has no memory of growing up in the South, because after his birth in Decatur, Georgia, in 1985, he was adopted and raised by a family in small-town New England. In fact, he made his first trip back to the state of Georgia to begin working on Native Son.<br />
        <br />
        Leavenworth’s parents were open about the fact that he was adopted, but as a child he had little desire to investigate his roots. He grew up with the knowledge that his birth mother had left a lengthy letter for him, but it wasn’t until he was an adult that Leavenworth wanted to read it. <br />
        <br />
        “I decided to read the letter and that propelled me forward to begin unraveling the mysterious nature of my own beginnings,” he says. “She talked about Georgia and her family and how I came to be and my father … it had a profound impact on me, and that was why I needed to get down there and see this place.”<br />
        <br />
        When Leavenworth made his first trip to Decatur in 2009, he was a young photographer. He soon realized that he was in over his head. His shyness made it difficult for him to approach strangers and, lacking any real plan for what he wanted to shoot, he achieved little. It took more than a year for Leavenworth to return to Georgia, but he was far more productive when he did. In the interim, he read voraciously about the state, studying its official and vernacular histories, taking note of places he might want to investigate.<br />
        <br />
        When he finally headed south again it was with a colleague who was working on a separate photo project. This time Leavenworth gave himself a solid two weeks to shoot, and arrived with places to stay, people to network with and a clear idea of the areas he wanted to photograph. <br />
        <br />
        Leavenworth returned to New York City excited about his work, but so broke that he couldn’t afford to develop the film for six months. In retrospect, he says, the dead time between creating the work and actually seeing it allowed him to “reflect and imagine my photographs as I’d remembered creating them, or the context of their creation. I found this process insightful … a little inclusion of a fictive element.”<br />
        <br />
        In the book we see dilapidated clapboard homes and churches; a man glaring from his truck window; a rope hanging from a tree; a girl on a swing; a young African-American woman looking into the camera defiantly. Leavenworth does not shy away from ideas of race and class, but also refuses to make “any sort of grand statement,” as he puts it. At the same time, his personal search imbues what could be viewed as straight documentary images with a tension that elevates the collection into something more than the sum of its parts.<br />
        <br />
        In this way Leavenworth’s outsider-ness is instrumental to the work’s success, because Native Son is a story of exploration and discovery. He is not trying to uncover some “truth” about the American South, but instead to make images that feel true to what he saw. “I am a collector, collecting evidence of my own lived experience. Nothing special,” he insists. “But I’m hungry, and I am obsessed with looking and questioning … and I want to share my discoveries.” He also wanted to make images that reflect some of what he felt when he returned “home” to a place where he never lived, a place to which he nonetheless holds a connection.<br />
        <br />
        While Leavenworth continues to travel to Georgia and search for this elusive connection, he has not yet attempted to find his mother. “It’s something I have begun to think more seriously about,” he says. “But I don’t know yet, we’ll see.”<br />
        <br />
        Leavenworth met his book’s publisher, Margo Dooney of <a target="_blank" href="http://vuucollective.com/">VUU</a>, at the <a target="_blank" href="http://nyartbookfair.com/">NY Art Book Fair</a> this past September. At the time, he was not actively looking for a publisher, and had already begun to research self-publishing options, determined to put the book out on his own if necessary. In working on his first book, Leavenworth’s biggest adjustment was balancing his own perfectionism and VUU’s tight publishing schedule.<br />
        <em><br />
        Native Son</em> is almost devoid of text, until near the end of the book where there is a scanned handwritten note: the last page of the lengthy letter that Leavenworth’s biological mother left him. Although it is brief, it grounds the photos and brings some context to the work. For the artist, it was not an easy decision to add any text, let alone use his mother’s letter. But when his publisher asked for an artist statement, Leavenworth struggled to write something he was happy with, then thought of using the letter.<br />
        <br />
        “I felt it belonged, but was a little skeptical due to the very personal aspect. It also remains slightly mysterious because she hasn’t addressed me by name … it may be confusing, but I didn’t want to qualify the letter in a statement,” Leavenworth explains. He says, “I’ve wanted to see this work in a physical book more as photographs only—no text—because it digs into that aura of mystique which one takes away from the photographs themselves … But the letter is the reason I am in Georgia.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        Los Angeles portrait shooter <a href="http://www.joepug.com/#/portfolio/current-work/OWI01" target="_blank">Joe Pugliese</a> has photographed a who’s who of celebrities, from Oprah Winfrey to Justin Bieber, and newsmakers such as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Sonia Sotomayor and the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs. His portraits of glamorous actors regularly appear in <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>, and he has photographed many of the world’s most powerful business executives for clients like Money.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        But Pugliese has also made portraits of injured American combat veterans, so it was not a stretch for<em> <a href="http://www.texasmonthly.com/" target="_blank">Texas Monthly</a></em> to commission him to photograph Texas soldiers returning from Afghanistan. <br />
        <br />
        <em>Texas Monthly</em> Director of Photography Leslie Baldwin says it was Pugliese’s “<a href="http://www.joepug.com/#/series/operation-mend" target="_blank">Operation Mend</a>” portraits of injured GIs that attracted the magazine’s attention.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        “Joe’s experience and interest in working with veterans was a plus to us,” says Baldwin. “We needed someone who was sensitive to the situation and wouldn’t buckle under pressure.”&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        There was pressure during the shoot at El Paso’s Fort Bliss because, while the creative team—Pugliese, two assistants, Baldwin and <em>Texas Monthly</em> Creative Director T.J. Tucker—had permission to photograph the returning soldiers, the veterans had just completed a lengthy plane ride, hadn’t seen their families in months and had no idea they would be asked to pose for pictures.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        “Talk about a nail biter!” says Baldwin. “Joe was the ultimate pro and made it all come together beautifully.”&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        The cover of <em>Texas Monthly</em>’s <a href="http://www.texasmonthly.com/issue/july-2013" target="_blank">July 2013 Coming Home issue</a>, and the 12-page photo essay inside the magazine, featured portraits of a dozen soldiers and their families returning to Fort Bliss after a nine-month deployment. Pugliese’s photo essay combined classic black-and-white documentary photos of the returning veterans with color portraits of the soldiers and their families posed against white seamless.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Pugliese shot the black-and-white images with a 35mm digital SLR while the 48-member unit was arriving and being processed. The color portraits were taken with a medium-format Hasselblad on a small, makeshift set moments after the soldiers were reunited with their loved ones.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        The original idea had been to photograph returning veterans all over Texas, both on their bases and in their homes, but it was decided that would be too costly and time-consuming. So Pugliese was under the gun to shoot the whole story at Fort Bliss.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        “We had no more than five minutes per family,” he says. “The whole shoot was under an hour.”<br />
        <br />
        Families that volunteered simply posed, many horsing around and mugging for the camera, in front of the white scrim Pugliese used to decontextualize and de-militarize the portraits.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        “I wanted to take the politics out of it. I wanted to make it human,” he says of the set. “They had been gone for a long time. This was a reunion.”&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Pugliese shot tethered to a laptop so Texas Monthly creatives could preview the images quickly. He says working so fast and so close could have been a disaster, but he loved how the shoot turned out.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        “For what it was, it was a fantastic project, my favorite project of the year,” says Pugliese. “I loved the simplicity and the honesty.”&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        The spontaneity of the shoot meant that Pugliese “had no idea what these pictures would look like.”<br />
        <br />
        “Would they be emotional? Stoic? Serious? You just have to pay attention and see what your subjects give you,” he says.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        For Pugliese, the take-away from the project was “direct less, pay attention, let things happen.”&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        “The learning process never stops,” he says. “The photographs get better and better the less I try to control the situation.” <br />
        <br />
        Baldwin says Pugliese’s photo essay for the Coming Home issue is “one of my favorite pieces we’ve done in the ten years I’ve been at Texas Monthly.”&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        “There’s an elegance to Joe’s portraits,” Baldwin continues, “beautiful lighting and great sense of color. The emotions and expressions in his portraits always seem genuine, not forced. We thought his approach would be perfect for our photo essay.”<br />

        Irish photographer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.andrewmcconnell.com/">Andrew McConnell</a> began his career as a photojournalist in Belfast, Northern Ireland, but since 2003 he has lived in Asia, Africa and now Beirut, Lebanon, pursuing long-term projects about stories that are often overlooked, untold or underreported.<br />
        <br />
        In 2011 McConnell won a pair of World Press Photo awards, one for a photograph of a woman practicing the cello in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the other for a photo essay titled “<a target="_blank" href="http://www.andrewmcconnell.com/index.php/category/the-last-colony">The Last Colony</a>” about Sahrawi refugees in the Western Sahara. The Sahrawi people have suffered one of the world’s most protracted refugee crises, having been condemned to refugee camps in 1975 when Morocco invaded the Western Sahara.<br />
        <br />
        McConnell’s Sahrawi story, which consisted of haunting portraits taken at night in the desert, led to an even more ambitious series: “<a target="_blank" href="http://www.andrewmcconnell.com/index.php/category/hidden-lives-the-untold-story-of-urban-refugees">Hidden Lives: The Untold Story of Urban Refugees</a>,” portraits of refugee families in eight cities around the world taken by available light. &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        “I would never have imagined undertaking a portrait-driven story. Most of my work is reportage,” says McConnell. “But when I went to the Sahrawi refugee camps I saw a lot of people I knew nothing about and the world knows nothing about, and I just felt reportage would not convey how forgotten these people are.”<br />
        <br />
        McConnell’s Saharan nocturnes came to the attention of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rescue.org/">International Rescue Committee</a> (IRC), which approached Panos Pictures, the London-based photo agency that represents McConnell, about commissioning a series of portraits to publicize the plight of urban refugees around the world. The IRC secured a grant from the European Commission’s Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection group that enabled McConnell to photograph Somali refugees in Kenya, Syrian refugees in Jordan, Congolese refugees in Burundi, Burmese refugees in Malaysia and refugees from the earthquake in Haiti, as well as refugees from many other nations now living in Bangkok, London and New York City. McConnell made all the portraits at night. &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        “Shooting at night works because it gets a sense of how hidden, how unseen they are,” explains McConnell. “These people are almost like ghosts in the cities. And on another level, it speaks to the long night these people are living through.” &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        McConnell photographed with a <a href="/Camera-Review-Canon-5887.shtml">Canon EOS 5D Mark III</a> which he says, “works magic in low light.” He supplemented the ambient city lights with one to three flash guns. &nbsp;<br />

Parvez was forced to flee Pakistan with his family after receiving death threats due to his work defending Christians charged under the country's blasphemy laws. &copy; Andrew McConnell/Panos </em><br />
        <br />
        The portraits, some 40 in all, were exhibited in 2013 at St. Pancras International train station in London and at The Cathedral of Saint John the Divine in New York City. “Hidden Lives” also has its own website, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hidden-lives.org.uk/index.asp">www.hidden-lives.org.uk</a>, that combines the portraits with testimonies from the individual refugees and photographs of their living spaces and identity papers. &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        “With reportage, a lot of times the people are just subject matter,” says McConnell of his decision to use portraiture in a social documentary project. “We wanted to elevate them as individuals and treat them with respect.” &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        The IRC’s goal with the “Hidden Lives” portraits is to challenge the stereotype that all refugees live in tent cities run by host countries and international aid agencies. &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        “For most people, the word ‘refugee’ conjures images of endless rows of white tents spread out over a dusty plain,” states the IRC website. “But this does not give an accurate picture of what life is like for millions of refugees in the twenty-first century. According to the United Nations Refugee Agency, today more than half of the world’s refugees live in the slums of some of the world’s biggest cities, such as Bangkok in Thailand, Amman in Jordan and Nairobi in Kenya.”&nbsp; <br />
        <p>“These people are everywhere,” says McConnell. “It’s not just a third-world problem. This can happen to anyone.”</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        One of the major benefits of the democratization of publishing in recent years is the autonomy it offers photographers who want to find audiences for their personal work. Now, photographers not only challenge themselves creatively with their self-assigned projects, they often also test their abilities as publishers and collaborators.<br />
        <br />
        For <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alexanderrichterphoto.com/">Alexander Richter</a>, who works primarily as an editorial and commercial photographer in New York City for clients like Atlantic Records, Nike, <em>Rolling Stone</em>, <em>Mass Appeal</em> and <em>XXL</em>, traveling to Kingston, Jamaica, to produce a body of work was about challenging himself to go abroad with no backing and create photo stories through force of determination and his ability to persuade subjects to participate. It was also an opportunity to collaborate with a writer and art director to publish and find an audience for the work.<br />
        <br />
        Richter’s interest in exploring life and culture in Kingston grew from his longtime appreciation for reggae and dancehall music, two art forms for which the city is famous. Through Tumblr, Richter had connected with writer <a target="_blank" href="http://babylonfalling.tumblr.com/">Sean Stewart</a>, who was born and raised in Kingston. After they decided to collaborate on what they envisioned as a print and digital project, they traveled to Kingston in August 2012 to work for seven days.<br />
        <br />
        They created roughly two stories per day, Richter says. “The goal was to cover music, explore art and sport culture, as well as some of the nefarious elements that exist … The idea was to show modern Kingston, its beauty and its underbelly, so once we landed it was nonstop—search, shoot and drive, day and night, to find the story.”<br />
        <br />
        Richter and Stewart had local help from a friend of Stewart’s, who made introductions for them, but as on all the best journeys, one connection led to another. A shoot with popular dancehall artist Tommy Lee led to an introduction to a fashion designer, who then introduced them to a tattoo artist. Other stories include a snapshot of Kingston gun culture, and profiles of a prominent local music promoter, a boxing legend and an Australian abstract sculptor who runs a gallery in a former Red Stripe beer factory.<br />
        <br />
        Approaching people and convincing them to participate depended heavily on the personalities of the photographer and writer. Richter brought business cards with some of his portraits of well-known musicians printed on them, but otherwise they relied on “the energy that we presented [subjects] with at that moment,” Richter says. “So it was kind of run and gun.”<br />
        <br />
        Once he had permission to photograph, however, Richter’s experience shooting editorial portraits helped him connect with his subjects. “I think the main thing that allowed me to do the work was just personality and the ability to have a very genuine interaction with whomever it was,” Richter says. “If you’re able to interact and create a natural connection there, and they can tell that you’re feeling that moment, they tend to relax and have a connection with you that’s a bit more authentic.”<br />
        <br />
        On their first night in Kingston, Richter defined the visual style he’d use for the project almost by default. Out at 2 AM documenting the prostitutes who work Ripon Road, he decided not to use a flash to limit the attention he was already drawing to himself and Stewart. He liked the look of the ambient light, and decided to shoot without flash throughout the project. An interior shot of a man holding a pistol, for instance, was lit using a Blackberry, Richter says. His photographs include documentary-style images, posed portraits, and details that pay special attention to atmosphere and place.<br />
        <br />
        Early on in his career, he says, he was gear-oriented, but work like he did in Jamaica has helped him develop a natural-light esthetic that he’s carried into his day-to-day work. “I can move people around and find places to make stuff happen that I think is interesting, but that doesn’t anchor me to outlets or battery packs,” he says.<br />
        <br />
        When they returned from Kingston, Richter and Stewart connected via Instagram with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thehomeofficecreative.com/">Anthony Harrison</a>, a designer in Portland, Oregon, who agreed to collaborate with them to publish the work digitally and in print. Richter and his collaborators dubbed the project “<a target="_blank" href="http://sevensclash.com/">Sevens Clash</a>,” a reference to a seminal roots reggae album by the group Culture, and built a brand around the work. While the ultimate goal was a print piece, which they created and released in December 2013 as a limited-edition zine, the digital component of “Sevens Clash” was essential to helping them find an audience.<br />
        <br />
        By publishing their stories as digital features throughout 2013, and sharing them on social media sites like Instagram and Facebook, Richter, Stewart, and Harrison built a following that resulted in features on <em>WIRED</em>’s Raw File blog and the now-defunct Tumblr Storyboard, among other media outlets. The work also led to commercial assignments for Richter for a major brand and creative firm. (Richter asked we keep the clients’ names quiet.) And when they published their zine, which included eight of their features, they sold out the limited edition of 100 quickly, with some of those copies purchased by fellow photographers Richter admires.<br />
        <br />
        “It was inspirational to see that the work resonated with people,” Richter says. “I already have a few other things that I’m ready to move forward with, because in the end I know I can do it independently.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        Celebrities are the new models. To sell copies, fashion magazines regularly feature the celebrity of the moment, modeling the clothes of the moment. For fashion photographers, the challenge is to create photo stories that present the celebrities in unexpected ways, while making sure they remain recognizable to readers and fans. 
        <br />
        For photographer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.emmasummerton.com/">Emma Summerton</a>, who moves seamlessly between shooting fashion and celebrity portraiture for publications such as <em>i-D</em>, <em>Purple</em>, <em>Vogue</em> and <em>W</em>, and commercial clients like Burberry, Miu Miu and Yves Saint Laurent, her approach is the same: All her work is based on creating an intriguing concept using an environment or location, and then letting her subjects inhabit it in ways that feel comfortable. “For me, it’s more about getting the mood and the space right, and then collaboratively running with it once the shoot starts.”<br />
        <br />
        The difference, she says, is that photographing models is easier. “When you work with girls like Gemma Ward or Lily Donaldson, who have been in training camp with photographers like Steven Meisel for many years, it’s incredible,” she explains. “You give them a personality to take on in the shot, and they just do it.” Moreover, they see themselves as part of a team. “They are interested in the hair, the makeup, the clothes,” Summerton says. “They don’t leave everything up to the photographer.”<br />
        <br />
        Busy celebrities, however, play a less active role in the process of creating a great image. “They are pressed for time,” explains Summerton, who has photographed George Clooney, Michelle Dockery, Nicole Kidman and Katy Perry. “They want to get the shot done, so they can move on to the next thing.”<br />
        <br />
        She frequently finds that the best images come at the end of a shoot, when everyone else feels like the workday is done. On a 2012 job for <em>W</em> photographing actors Nicole Kidman and Clive Owen, she recalls, publicists were rushing them through shots. The story was called “An Affair to Remember,” a nod to the film the two actors were promoting, <em>Hemingway and Gellhorn</em>, and to the ladylike 1950s clothes of the season in which Kidman was posing. As they were wrapping the shoot at the Beverly Wilshire hotel in Los Angeles, Summerton noticed Kidman looking in the mirror, and asked her to take one final shot. “I took about five frames, and one of those ended up being my favorite photograph,” Summerton says.  <br />
        <br />
        Summerton has years of experience both with fashion models and performers, thanks to a career that started out as a happy accident, and has grown to include commissions from commercial brands, fashion magazines and celebrities like Katy Perry, who hired Summerton to bring her distinctive, graphic concepts to the promotional campaign for the singer’s single “Teenage Dream.” <br />
        <br />
        Summerton says she never guessed she would shoot commercial and editorial work when she was a student at the National Art School in Sydney during the early 1990s. Then, while out for coffee with her musician boyfriend, she met a professional photographer who was looking for an assistant. Summerton offered her services, even though her experience was limited to working in the school darkroom. “It was eye-opening,” she laughs. “I realized I had almost no technical skills.”<br />
        <br />
        For the next six years, she devoted herself to learning the craft by assisting fashion and lifestyle photographers in Australia. During that time, she discovered <em>Vogue</em> Italia. “It was a revelation for me,” she says. “I said to myself, ‘Oh my god, there’s fashion photography that can actually be put on a wall.’” <br />
        <br />
        In 1998, she moved to London. “I wanted to leave Sydney before I got too comfortable there.” Rather than work for another professional photographer, she got a job as a studio assistant for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fionabanner.com/">Fiona Banner</a>, a British installation artist who was shortlisted for the prestigious Turner Prize in 2002. <br />
        <br />
        Much of her time in Banner’s studio was spent on printmaking and drawing, but she never stopped taking photographs. Along with capturing shots of Banner’s text-based installations, she also took the artist’s portrait for press releases. Banner didn’t influence Summerton’s personal work, but working for the artist taught her how to nurture her visions. “I got to see how someone could transform an idea into a work of art,” she explains. It’s something she aspires to do in her photography. <br />
        <br />
        Through friends of friends, Summerton met Stacey Mark, then photo director for <em>Nylon</em>, who began assigning her freelance fashion pieces for the front of the magazine, and later portraits of musicians like The Raveonettes and The Kills. Around the same time, she was working on a personal project that would inform her later esthetic, and it led to a big break in fashion.<br />
        <br />
        The project involved self-portraits she took with a Polaroid camera. “My mother was a dressmaker, and in school, she would make me dresses to wear to dances based on drawings I made,” she says. Back then, costumes were an access point to unleash Summerton’s imagination. In her “Polaroid experiments,” as she calls them, costumes again became a vehicle for her to express her inner life.  <br />
        <br />
        The most successful of the portraits involved a pair of Terry de Havilland shoes she purchased in a boutique in London. When Summerton went back to buy another pair, she found that the shop where she had purchased them was gone. “I found de Havilland’s contact information via Google, and sent him some of the Polaroids I had taken with his shoes,” she says. She hoped he would let her borrow a few more pairs. He was so impressed, however, that he offered her a job taking the photographs for the brand’s next look book. <br />
        <br />
        That job led to more work in the fashion industry, and soon she was shooting a spread for <em>Dazed &amp; Confused</em> featuring designer Stefano Pilati’s first collection for Yves Saint Laurent. He saw the work, and bought prints of the whole story. “That really opened up doors in the fashion industry,” she says. <br />
        <br />
        Today, it would be hard to find a fashion publication Summerton has not shot for. Her lush, graphically sophisticated images are easy to spot. “Emma is a great colorist with a magical eye,” says Mia Adorante, associate to the fashion and style director at <em>W</em>. Explains Summerton, “I don’t like white spaces.” She cites director Stanley Kubrick and cinematographer Edward Linden as inspirations. “If you freeze frame any of their films, the resulting images look like oil paintings.” Her esthetic also reflects her personal taste. “My apartment is stuffed full of vintage cabaret, lace curtains, pictures from all over the world,” she says. “I love things even more if they’re falling apart.”<br />
        <br />
        She also loves the look of analogue film. Although she shoots with digital equipment—she switches between cameras a lot, but cites the <a target="_blank" href="http://us.leica-camera.com/photography/s_system/">Leica S-System</a> as one she recently tried—she often imitates the color effects of her early Polaroid work. “My assistant and I keep a really detailed catalogue of all of the lighting we’ve ever done—from daylight shoots to studio sets,” she explains. This allows Summerton to go back and recreate the same effects in disparate conditions.<br />
        <br />
        Her images always evoke a sense of place. Summerton typically creates an entire environment from scratch, or collaborates with the editorial team who has a location in mind. “She loves to research and puts her all into her work,” says <em>W</em>’s Adorante.<br />
        <br />
        For a cover story on George Clooney for<em> W</em>’s Art Issue, released in December 2013, Summerton was told that Clooney would be wearing a black-and-white polka dot suit designed by the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama. After brainstorming with the magazine’s design director, Johan Svensson, and photography director, Caroline Wolff, Summerton asked Kusama to design a matching backdrop to go with the images. Thomas Thurnauer, a set designer, created a table and chair covered in dots to fill out the composition. The resulting work is equal parts surrealist and retro pop—Clooney’s face practically jumps out of the textured surfaces of the images.  <br />
        <br />
        Although Summerton primarily shoots for fashion clients, she hasn’t ruled out the possibility of showing her work in an exhibition, marking a return to what first drew her to fashion photography when she was a young assistant. “Right now, I’m just letting go, and going along for the ride,” she says.<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
         Portrait photographer <a href="http://www.michaellewisphotography.com/" target="_blank">Michael Lewis</a>, one of six photographers we interviewed for “How Great Portraits Are Made," says he has long been fascinated by <a href="http://www.pacegallery.com/artists/414/lucas-samaras" target="_blank">Lucas Samaras</a>’s Polaroids, particularly the way the artist calls attention to the subjectivity and artifice of his hallucinatory images. Working in 8 x 10- or 20 x 24-inch Polaroids, Samaras often puts himself in his frames. He also shows the light stands and gels he used to produce the otherworldly colors in his images, revealing his tools and tricks to the viewer. Lewis discovered the work when he was in college, studying color photography. To Lewis, Samaras’s work seemed to say, “We’re using fake lighting. Why do we have to pretend that it’s real?” 
        <br />
        Having photographed politicians, musicians, entrepreneurs, writers and artists, as well as many well-known movie and TV actors, Lewis is keenly aware of how much artifice goes into portraits of celebrities. When he photographs so-called “real people,” he says, he usually photographs them in their own homes or workplaces, and they wear their own clothes. When photographing Hollywood personalities, however, “You’re quite often photographing them in a place they’ve never been that doesn’t mean anything to them. They come in dressed one way, they’re shot another way,” he says. “None of it’s real.”<br />
        <br />
        Lewis says he dabbled only briefly with colored lights; even when he’s using lights to alter the space in which he photographs portrait subjects, he wants his lighting and use of color to be “grounded in reality.” Such attention to realism is “the antithesis of what I like about Samaras,” he admits. Still, he admires how Samaras references the process by which he makes his photos, which question the illusion that a photo is a window onto reality. Says Lewis, “That was something that was liberating to me.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pascalshirley.com/">Pascal Shirley</a> likes to photograph his 20-something friends on road trips and outdoor adventures, just enjoying each other’s company. It’s personal work with the genuine, carefree feel that many brand managers are looking for. But Shirley’s challenge, when he was trying to launch his career, was harnessing his documentary style for commercial application, and getting his work noticed.
        <br />
        It took time, patience, mentoring and a measure of luck. Shirley struggled to attract commercial clients for nearly two years, shooting weddings for friends (and friends of friends) to stay afloat. His career started taking off about a year ago with local assignments through personal connections. Around the same time, he signed with <a target="_blank" href="http://iheartreps.com/">I Heart Reps</a> in Los Angeles, which has helped Shirley build momentum and land his first national advertising jobs.<br />
        <br />
        After studying photography at the California College of the Arts, Shirley moved to Los Angeles in 2007. “My plan was to assist as much as possible. I came from a fine-art background, and I didn’t have much technical training,” he says.<br />
        <br />
        He assisted regularly for Jeff Lipsky and Craig Cameron Olsen. Olsen turned into a good friend and mentor. “We hang out and talk photography and look at each other’s portfolios. He has taught me a lot about the business from his own experiences,” Shirley says.<br />
        <p></p>
        <p>He also assisted many out-of-town photographers on fashion, celebrity and lifestyle shoots, including Patrick Fraser, Nadav Kander, Nicolas Moore and Patric Shaw, among others. But his intention had always been to shoot for his own clients someday, and in his spare time, he was practicing his craft.</p>
        Shirley had tried fashion test shoots. “There was this pressure in LA to do test shoots with agencies and models. It didn’t really click with me, so I went back to shooting personal work of my friends,” he says.<br />
        <br />
        By the end of 2010, he was “getting a little tired of assisting” so he cut back to free up more time for personal work. At the urging of Olsen, he also started putting more effort into self-promotion.<br />
        <br />
        “Craig got on Instagram right when it started, and he was like, ‘You ought to check this out.’ I thought: Ugh, more social media? And Craig was like, ‘You gotta get on this.’<br />
        <br />
        “I became more social on the networking side, which I wasn’t doing much, but it’s very important,” Shirley says. In addition to getting on <a target="_blank" href="http://instagram.com/pascalshirley">Instagram</a>, he also started a <a target="_blank" href="http://pascalshirley.tumblr.com/">Tumblr blog</a>. He posted pictures from his road trips with friends, “and followers started coming along. It’s not like I have tons of followers, but people started taking notice.”<br />
        <br />
        One was freelance photo editor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.katie-dunn.com/">Katie Dunn</a>. “I found [on Tumblr] tons of his images that were perfect for different stories that I was pulling images for,” she says, explaining that she was looking for images that felt more authentic than stock photography.<br />
        <br />
        It was through Dunn that Shirley began licensing images to <em>Cosmopolitan</em>, <em>GQ</em> and other magazines. Those licensing deals led to some editorial assignments. Shirley also started to get assignments with some West Coast advertising clients through connections with friends he was photographing. Those clients included Coldsmoke apparel, Fresco Towels and Garrett Leight California Optical.<br />
        <br />
        Meanwhile, Shirley had been casting about for a rep. He compiled a list of reps in Los Angeles, and sent an e-mail inquiry to I Heart Reps. Owner Dara Siegel invited him for a meeting, and agreed to represent him on a trial basis.<br />
        <br />
        “I loved his work. I liked him as a person and he had experience assisting, so he knew how it all worked,” Siegel says. “If someone’s really talented, and I see the spark of what [it] takes to be a commercial photographer, I’ll coach them.”<br />
        <br />
        She encouraged Shirley to shoot constantly, while working on his lighting and production values. “Every week I send her new pictures,” Shirley says. “She expects that, and I’ve been pretty good about it.”<br />
        <br />
        The goal was to create images in which brand managers could imagine their products. To that end, Siegel helped Shirley come up with advertising concepts for test shoots, and encouraged him to give his friends more direction when he photographed them.<br />
        <br />
        For instance, after he recently lost a bid for a Reebok campaign, Shirley gathered some friends to shoot the campaign as if he’d won it, just for practice. The brief was “three girls hanging out in Venice Beach for the day, having fun with a carefree kind of feel,” Shirley explains.<br />
        <br />
        Siegel also worked with Shirley on his social media presence, helping him edit his Tumblr and Instagram feed to emphasize images with advertising potential.<br />
        <br />
        “We’re finding that for one out of every five jobs, the art director is finding the photographer through social media,” Siegel says. “We’re making sure he’s ‘friending’ the right people, responding, liking their photos and commenting” on their posts.<br />
        <br />
        In early 2013, Shirley got an assignment to shoot an outdoor campaign for a Canadian department store called Mark’s. The job came to him through a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.maclaren.com/">MacLaren McCann</a> art director Shirley had met while assisting Lipsky. The art director “kept in touch with me and followed my Tumblr,” Shirley says.<br />
        <br />
        Around that time, Shirley quit taking assisting jobs. “As much as you might want that few hundred dollars [for an assisting job], you’ve got to cut yourself off from it totally so people don’t look at you as an assistant any more.”<br />
        <p></p>
        <p>Siegel has been setting up meetings with ad agency art directors on national accounts, so Shirley has been making the rounds with his portfolio in New York City and San Francisco, in addition to promoting himself on social media. He’s also working on a self-published book that he’ll give to prospective clients.</p>
        “People want tangible objects,” he says.<br />
        <br />
        And he’s trying to arrange an exhibition for a personal project he recently shot in Iceland, featuring attractive friends cavorting about the beautiful landscape. “Everything is digital now, and I’ve been noticing that people want to see prints,” Shirley says.<br />
        <br />
        His advice for assistants trying to transition is to make time to shoot personal work. “It is easy to get caught up [in] assisting too much because it gets comfortable,” he says. He also advises aspiring photographers to take advantage of opportunities to show their work in pop-up shows and other local venues to get attention and work from local clients, and then build business from there.<br />

        Before photographing the sketch comedy team Key &amp; Peele for The New York Times, Michael Lewis asked them for their ideas, and shared a lesson he had learned about planning portrait concepts when Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers rejected his idea and took control of a shoot.

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        Before <a target="_blank" href="http://www.michaellewisphotography.com/">Michael Lewis</a> photographed the stars of <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cc.com/shows/key-and-peele">Key &amp; Peele</a></em>, a sketch comedy show on Comedy Central, he first asked for their thoughts about how they wanted to be photographed. Photographers sometimes come up with a “gag,” says Lewis, who was on assignment for <em>The New York Times</em>, but he told Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, “I don’t think I should be telling you what’s funny. You’re the comedians.”  
        <br />
        Lewis says, “They were very surprised that I was offering this chance to collaborate.” He told them about a shoot he did 14 years ago when musician Anthony Kiedis taught him a lesson about imposing his own ideas about a subject.<br />
        <br />
        Lewis’s career shooting celebrities had just taken off when he landed an assignment to photograph the Red Hot Chili Peppers. “I had really elaborate ideas. I’d brought a lot of props.” He planned to photograph the band in the courtyard of the Los Angeles apartment building where he lived at the time. Then the band’s lead singer and songwriter, Anthony Kiedis, arrived. “Kiedis took one look at the kiddie pool, and the toy fishing line, and he said, ‘We’re not doing that,’ and he just starts moving all the props out of the way.”<br />
        <br />
        In hindsight, Lewis says, his concepts for the shoot were based on an outmoded idea of the band that dated back to when he first listened to them, when they were building their reputation as a goofy funk/punk band. Lewis had set up his props and lights indoors, but Kiedis proposed moving outdoors to the front of the apartment building. He grabbed a garden hose and started having a water fight. Then Kiedis stuck the hose down his pants. Rick Rubin, who had produced some of the band’s records, liked the photo that Lewis took so much he asked the photographer for a print.  <br />
        <br />
        Lewis says that when he studied fine-art photography, he was encouraged to express himself in his photos. In creating editorial portraits, he wants to create “a Michael Lewis image,” but has other goals as well. “A lot of portrait photographers forget that at the end of the day it’s a portrait of someone else, not of them,” he says. “They put so much of themselves in, they treat their subjects like props.”<br />
        <br />
        It surprises Lewis that celebrity publicists are more concerned with logistics or making sure the shoot doesn’t take too much of their clients’ time than they are with the content of the image, or making sure the photographer gets a good photo. Lewis, who got his MFA at San Francisco Art Institute, says his experience during class critiques is helpful when talking to reluctant publicists. “If you can verbally articulate the visual language to someone, they’ll step back and say, ‘OK, now that makes sense,’” he explains. If they’re not convinced, he listens. “Then I’ll reword my original idea using their own words to bring us to a common understanding. I’m always open to suggestions and ideas, but if I am confident that my original idea is going to make a great portrait, I can shift a bit to accommodate their concerns, so that they don’t kill the entire setup.”<br />
        <p>On set, Lewis seizes opportunities to talk with subjects themselves. “I’ll walk up like I’m going up to check the light. I’ll have an exchange with the subject that no one else hears.” He might talk to them about their work, or a common interest he’s researched. Says Lewis, “It creates a micro moment that only you and the subject have, and I’ve found the subject is more open to direction.”</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <strong>Client:</strong> ABC Carpet &amp; Home
        <p><strong> Art Director:</strong> Angela Gruszka</p>
        <p>A brilliantly colored silk carpet is spread beneath a canopy of trees at night. A path, illuminated by unseen light, leads into the distance. This fairy tale image is one of eight ads in the campaign for ABC Carpet &amp; Home, the luxury home design and carpet store in Manhattan. <a href="http://jasonmadara.com/home.html" target="_blank">Jason Madara</a> photographed eight handmade, one-of-a-kind carpets over the course of two nights on the manicured grounds of the LongHouse Reserve, a sculpture garden in East Hampton, New York. Working under a moonless sky from 7 PM until 4 AM, Madara had to provide all the illumination in the garden. “I basically approached it like it was in the studio,” he recalls. <br />
        <br />
        Madara, who is based in San Francisco, says he and Angela Gruszka, the art director for ABC Carpet &amp; Home’s advertising, spent about two months brainstorming the campaign. For a previous campaign, Madara had photographed carpets in empty rooms. Each wall was painted a different hue, highlighting the colors of a carpet’s design. For the new campaign, they wanted something different, but equally dramatic. They decided to take the carpets into nature. “Considering last year was inside, outside made sense,” the photographer says. <br />
        <br />
        When he is conceiving images, Madara typically creates mood boards to show his ideas to clients. For the newest ABC Carpet &amp; Home campaign, he took inspiration from Dutch landscape paintings in which the rich colors of forests and pastures are enhanced by afternoon sunlight breaking through clouds. <br />
        <br />
        In composing the shots, “it was a delicate balance,” Madara says. “The rugs are the heroes but you couldn’t showcase the beauty of the rugs without the environment,” he explains. “As far as the lighting, we knew it had to be dramatic and strong, making a strong statement.” <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Logistics</strong><br />
        Says Madara, “Shooting in the dead of night brings its own challenges. Lots of work lights, bug spray and generators fix that problem.” The locations for each of the eight shoots were chosen during a scout around the LongHouse Reserve. He and his crew would first set up work lights so they could see what they were doing. Then the digital tech set up the computer and monitor, while Madara’s assistants set up lights and power packs. Handlers put each rug into position. Then Madara captured separate images of the foreground and background for each scene, as well as plates of certain areas. When all the exposures were done, the crew packed up the gear and walked to the next location for the next ad. Each ad took about two hours to set up and shoot. Madara recalls, “We didn’t stop from 7 at night until 4 in the morning, we just powered through it.”<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Lighting</strong><br />
        Whether he’s shooting an interior, an exterior or a portrait, Madara’s lighting plan begins with one light, then he adds more lights in succession. In each shot of the ABC Carpet &amp; Home campaign, he took an approach similar to what he would do when creating a portrait, he says. “I start with the background and how I want it to look, always separating it from the key light on the foreground, occasionally letting the background light bleed into the foreground for overall mood and [ambience], then add the key light to the subject, normally with a gridded beauty dish or a seven-inch grid spot that’s focused directly on the subject.” Before lighting the rug, he first worked on lighting the background to set the mood. In each shot, he used between six and eight <a href="http://profoto.com/" target="_blank">Profoto</a> lights, each with 5-, 10- or 20-degree grids. <br />
        <br />
        “Grids make a bold statement and I thought the whole environment should be specular and contrasty,” he says. The hard lights are unforgiving, he notes, because moving any light by an inch changes the look, but he likes their effect. He notes, “I always travel with softboxes and umbrellas but never end up using them.”<br />
        <br />
        In the shot with the garden path in the background, he began by lighting the tree at camera left, then added grids pointing toward the bushes next to it. Tucked outside the frame, he placed another light on a stand about 15 feet high pointing down through the trees, like moonlight. Another light with a grid was placed out of the frame at camera left to illuminate flowers and branches. At the furthest visible point of the path leading into the distance, he had an assistant place a 10-degree grid about three feet above the ground. “It helped open up the path,” leading the viewer’s eye into the distance and giving the image more depth.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>He lit the rug using a silver beauty dish with a grid at camera right, pointing down on the middle of the rug, creating slight fall off at the edges. “We did test shots of the background first, then started doing test shots with all the strobes on to see how everything looked together.” Next, Madara says, “We did a few exposures of everything on, then separate plates with only particular lights on, to then put them all together in post later.”</p>

        <br />
        <strong>Camera </strong><br />
        Madara used a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hasselbladusa.com/promotions/h4x-.aspx">Hasselblad H4X</a> with a <a href="/Object-of-Desire-Ph-8204.shtml">Phase One IQ260</a> back. “We knew we wanted big files with a lot of latitude to eventually make giant prints for the store,” he says. For lenses, he used a 50mm and an 80mm. <br />
        <br />
        He bracketed each shot to make sure he provided his retoucher with enough variations in light and contrast. With no ambient light in the scene, “all bracketing was done through ISO brackets, leaving the aperture and shutter speed the same,” at f/11 for a quarter of a second, he says. He also bracketed some shots by turning the power on the packs up or down.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Post-Production</strong><br />
        <a target="_blank" href="http://pixelchickstudios.net/">Rebecca Bausher</a>, a retoucher in San Francisco, has collaborated with Madara on all of his projects over the past four years. “She’s really involved in the concept process,” and had seen the paintings he had referenced when planning the ABC Carpet shoot, Madara says. When he provides bracketed shots to Bausher, “I make notes on the RAW image of where I want the shadows and highlights to be.”<br />
        <br />
        During the post-production phase, the backgrounds were scarcely retouched. Attention was paid to accurately reproducing the colors in the carpet. Once Gruszka approved each composite, Madara provided the client with two files—an RGB file for use on the Web, and a CMYK for print ads and in-store displays. <br />
        <br />
        As Madara notes, dark, contrasty shots are more challenging to reproduce accurately when printed on paper. In converting the RGB files to CMYK, the contrast was “pulled back a little,” he says, “because we had to be wary of how they would print.”<br />
        <br />
        The ads have appeared in <em>Wallpaper*</em>, <em>Whitewall</em> and other style magazines, and the campaign itself has been featured on design blogs. Says Madara, “It turned out exactly as we had planned.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <a href="http://meikophoto.com/" target="_blank">Meiko Takechi Arquillos</a> says that no matter whom she’s photographing, “there is a story to be told,” and she sees it as her job to find that story, and translate it into a portrait that viewers immediately relate to. 
        <br />
        “I originally started out taking pictures of kids because it was easy for me to connect with them,” she says. “I love playful and authentic sensibilities in images. What I usually do is really make myself seem very goofy—I don’t need to try very hard either—and that lets people’s guard down.”<br />
        <br />
        Last summer, editors at <em>The Guardian Weekend</em> assigned her to shoot a cover for a nostalgic story about summertime food you ate as a kid. Arquillos cast a boy named Charlie for the project. She had previously worked with him on a shoot for <em>Real Simple</em> magazine.<br />
        <br />
        “He is not your usual happy, smiley kid,” Arquillos says. “He has a lot of character. While he is super cute, he also has an attitude. I love that about him.”<br />
        <p></p>
        <p>She explains that she’s not interested in shooting “normal, cute kid pictures” because they’re not authentic: Kids have more personality and complexity than such images suggest.</p>
        <p><em>Guardian</em> Picture Editor Kate Edwards didn’t want another cute kid photo for the story, either, “and I was so grateful,” Arquillos says.</p>
        Arquillos was looking for something viewers would find familiar and unexpected at the same time, so she thought about scenarios that might have appealed to her as a kid. One idea she came up with was to show Charlie with not just one colorful Popsicle, but a bunch of them all at once, melting down his chin and arms. <br />
        <br />
        “It is important to have some conversations to get to know the subject first,” Arquillos says. “It is my way to figure out how far I can stretch it. In this case, I probably said something like, ‘So Charlie! Do you like Popsicles? You do? How would you like it if I gave you eight more?!’ Then I wait and see his reaction.”<br />
        <br />
        Charlie wasn’t happy, and the cover photo she shot shows it.  <br />
        <br />
        “You look at it and go, ‘Why [not]? Is he sneaking these Popsicles before his parents find out?’ It always makes you stop and think about the story behind it when you see something unexpected,” she says.<br />
        <br />
        In preparation for all of her shoots, Arquillos comes up with a lot of ideas, but doesn’t wed herself to any of them. “You have to be malleable,” she says. “Often something unexpected strikes during a shoot.” She also avoids doing too much research on her subjects, for fear that it could drive away serendipity on set.<br />
        <br />
        After tweaking the lighting and composition, Arquillos says, “I snap away like crazy as I talk to the subject. Sometimes real stuff comes out when a subject starts to get tired, but I have to be careful not to exhaust them.”<br />

        Photographer <a href="http://scovilphotography.com/" target="_blank">Jeff Scovil</a> of Phoenix travels 230 days per year around the U.S. and Europe to photograph crystal specimens for mineral dealers, private collectors, museums, scientists and publishers. He’s the author of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Photographing-Minerals-Fossils-Lapidary-Materials/dp/0945005210" target="_blank">Photographing Minerals, Fossils, and Lapidary Materials</a> </em>(Mountain Press Publishing Co, 1996), and is a long-time contributor to <em>The Mineralogical Record</em> and <em>Rocks &amp; Minerals</em> magazines.  
        <p></p>
        <p><strong><em>PDN</em>: How did you get started shooting minerals and crystals?<br />
        Jeff Scovil: </strong>I started collecting crystals when I was about 8 years old. In college I was an anthropology and archaeology major. I did a lot of research into forensic photography, and applied it to archaeology. Then I applied what I learned to shooting minerals. That was in 1975. I started doing it professionally in 1990.</p>
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: What’s appealing to you about photographing minerals and crystals?<br />
        JS:</strong> They’re beautiful: the color, the luster, the transparency of them and the variety of forms. Photographing minerals is a matter of total control. And that’s me: a little bit of a control freak, a little [obsessive compulsive]. It gives me an outlet to finely manipulate the subject and the lighting. There’s an incredible amount of detail to recognize and bring out. <br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: So how do you go about it?<br />
        JS:</strong> The setup is done on a raised sheet of non-glare glass. That helps cut down reflections, I don’t have to worry about shadows and the glass allows me to light from any direction. I use a variety of [colored] backgrounds [and] a softbox positioned above the piece I’m photographing. I have another light under the table to illuminate the background, and a third light that I call a kicker, which sits on the glass, positioned any way I need it.<br />
        <br />
        Crystals have numerous faces, and you have to define the shape, [so] you have to get different amounts of reflection from each face to distinguish them from each other. You also have to be able to see through the reflection of each face to the inside of the crystal. Each face has micro topographic features [i.e., imperfections] and you have to bring those out, too. There’s the rub. So I have 3.5 x 5-inch cards that I carefully position around the crystal, to reflect light off of the faces.<br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: What does the kicker light do?<br />
        JS:</strong> When you’re photographing something highly reflective, you really have to use diffuse lights, or you get burned-out highlights. So I have the softbox light, but when you use a diffuse light source, you start losing dimensionality, transparency [and] saturation of color. It starts to look dead. The kicker light puts the life back in. It is aimed at the specimen, which is surrounded by the reflector cards. <br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: Besides lighting, what are the other challenges?<br />
        JS:</strong> Propping up the specimens is a challenge. Sometimes they’re heavy, or just top heavy. My greatest nightmare is breaking a specimen. I’ve only destroyed two specimens. The first time, it was a $100 specimen that fell off the glass. The second time, the specimen was worth a couple of hundred dollars. When I was putting it back in the box, it started to crumble.<br />
        <br />
        Now I carry liability insurance of $1 million, which costs $500 a year.<br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you promote yourself?<br />
        JS:</strong> I’ve been in it so long that it’s all word of mouth. But I’ve been putting an ad in <em>The Mineralogical Record</em> for the past year. I want to make sure I’m still out there, in people’s faces, and a friend of mine says I need to be branded with a classy reputation. <br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: How did you establish your reputation?<br />
        JS:</strong> Before I started doing this as a profession, my philosophy was publish, publish, publish. I became a regular contributor to several [mineralogical] magazines. I only required that every picture published had my [credit] so you were always seeing my name. <br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: How did you transition from hobbyist to professional?<br />
        JS:</strong> I would attend mineral shows, going from dealer to dealer with a portfolio, asking the dealers if they wanted me to take pictures of specimens. My first road trip was when the publisher of <em>Rocks &amp; Minerals</em> wanted pictures of some minerals from China. A collector in California had some of the minerals. So I shot those, and the road trips kept building from there. <br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you arrange jobs for a road trip?<br />
        JS: </strong>Sometimes it revolves around a show. I keep a list of [dealers and collectors] who want me to shoot for them, as well as a list of people I’ve shot for in the past, and when I have trip coming up, I call them.<br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you travel?<br />
        JS:</strong> I drive to a lot of places because I have a truck full of equipment. <br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: What gear do you carry?<br />
        JS:</strong> I’ve got a table that folds up, a couple of sheets of glass, backgrounds, diffuser material, reflector cards in a variety of sizes up to 8 x 10 [inches], natural density filters in case things are too bright, blocks, putty, clips, glass cleaner, light stands, a tripod, a magic arm, a portable <a href="http://www.manfrotto.us/" target="_blank">Manfrotto</a> boom. I carry about six cases of equipment—for shooting something so small, it’s a lot of crap, but you have to have a lot of control. I’m a fussy maximalist.<br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: What camera and lenses do you use?<br />
        JS:</strong> For years, I shot film, first with a Pentax, then the Canon F-1 system. I would light specimens as best as I could, bracket a little bit, then pray. Digital is a godsend. I use a Nikon D2Xs, mostly with a 60mm macro lens, but also a 105mm macro. I shoot tethered and I can tweak the lights until [I’m] really happy. <br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: Why do clients want the pictures? How do they use them?<br />
        JS:</strong> Dealers use pictures for publicity. Museums use them for publicity and education. For collectors, it boils down to ego. They know it’s likely they’ll have my photos of their minerals published in magazines with their name on it. I have two collectors who pay me a bonus if I get them a cover of a magazine.<br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>:  What are your rates?<br />
        JS: </strong>At first I was charging peanuts to get my foot in the door. Now I charge [dealers and collectors] $1,000 a day plus expenses. I average 20 pieces in a day. The magazines are a different story: They’re cash poor. They pay $40 a shot.<br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: Why do you continue to license pictures at that price?<br />
        JS:</strong> It’s publicity [i.e., self-promotion]. In an average year, I publish 1,300 photographs in books, magazines, posters, calendars—things like that. Textbook publishers will pay based on page size, with a minimum price of $180. <br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: What advice do you have for photographers who are interested in this niche?<br />
        JS: </strong>Start studying minerals and mineralogy and mineral collecting. As you’re doing that, find a collector in the neighborhood [who] you can mooch minerals from to start learning [how to shoot]. There’s the website www.mindat.org, where you can get information about any mineral. It also has a forum where people share pictures of minerals.<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        In the course of his career, Washington, DC-based <a href="http://www.johnharrington.com/" target="_blank">John Harrington</a> has photographed a wide range of subjects, from actors and musicians to business moguls and presidents. However, he’s often tasked with photographing people who are not used to being in front of the camera, which presents its own set of challenges. “People naturally stiffen up, and all of their preconceived opinions about their appearance come to the fore,” Harrington explains. “I try to break through that.” <br />
        <br />
        In order to do this, he talks to his subjects first—without his camera—to find out what they do for a living so he knows how to photograph them. Then he’ll slowly walk them over to where the lights are set up and ease them into the shoot. If he feels they are tensing up at any point, he’ll again put down his camera and engage them some more, asking about their family or a subject matter that will help elicit a reaction or emotion. <br />
        <br />
        Harrington began his career as a photojournalist, and notes that many portraiture assignments require the same kind of on-the-fly problem solving. When they’re not sure what the shooting environment will be like, his team always packs three cases of lighting equipment. The ideal situation, he says, is when the client wants to brainstorm ideas before the shoot. <br />
        <br />
        One of his all-time favorite examples of collaborating with a client was when he photographed Bryan Mundy and Ed Trimble of EzGov Inc. The goal of the image was to “demonstrate how the client’s company helps to get through all of the red tape in Washington so citizens can engage governments,” Harrington explains. A concept that came up in their meeting was wrapping one of the co-founders in red tape—literally—while the other co-founder cuts him free. Harrington adds, “The idea was to do this with the U.S. Capitol building—an easy symbol of the government—in the background.” Harrington made some initial portraits of the two men indoors, all the while talking up the concept for the red tape. By the time they got to the location, he says he had “primed the pump” so the subjects were excited to participate in the shoot.<br />
        <br />
        Many iconic places throughout Washington, DC, have served as backdrops for Harrington’s portraits, helping to communicate ideas as well as provide a setting for the image. Years ago, when he photographed the city’s then Mayor-elect Anthony A. Williams, he wanted the image to take place on the banks of the Potomac River—so much so that he was willing to spend 15 minutes of his hour-long shoot getting Williams to the location. At the time, back in early 1999, Washington, DC, was on the brink of financial ruin. The image of Williams “was about revitalizing the city, and water represents that,” Harrington explains. <br />
        <p>These on-location shoots can be difficult to accomplish because many spots in Washington, DC, require photographers have a permit. Yet Harrington notes that when he mentions this to potential clients it often helps him land the gig—mostly, because other photographers bidding on the job failed to mention the need for a permit so he seems more prepared. Once he’s on set, Harrington says, “demonstrating responsible confidence is important” as long as it’s not perceived as arrogance. He adds, “Clients will quickly replace an arrogant photographer with one who’s easy to work with, and can execute a vision through a garnering of respect.”</p>

        "I think a big part of being a portrait photographer is the ability to carve out the opportunity for yourself, to build the trust, to even get the change to take the picture you want to take," says Emily Shur. Her conversation with embattled former cyclist Lance Armstrong about how she wanted to photograph him put the potentially defensive subject at ease.<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        It’s rare, says <a target="_blank" href="http://www.emilyshur.com/">Emily Shur</a>, to speak on the phone with a subject before a shoot. But there she was in her hotel room in Aspen, Colorado, last November, explaining to former professional cyclist <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lancearmstrong.com/">Lance Armstrong</a> what she envisioned for their <em>ESPN The Magazine</em> shoot later in the day. The conversation was a delicate one. Armstrong, the vilified one-time king of cycling whose career and reputation were sullied by a doping scandal, was likely to be a wary subject. A misplaced word, Shur thought, and “he wouldn’t have trusted me and would’ve given me, like, ten minutes.”<br />
        <br />
        She says, “I think a big part of being a portrait photographer is the ability to carve out the opportunity for yourself, to build the trust, to even get the chance to take the picture you want to take.” She tried to convey to Armstrong that she wasn’t there to judge or put one over on him. “I really did want him to like the pictures, and I hope he did,” she says.<br />
        <br />
        Shur read the interview with Armstrong that would appear in the magazine, and felt that it was balanced and forthcoming. She told Armstrong that she wanted a “simple, honest picture of just him,” and that she’d like to do something outside, since they were in Aspen. In the interview, Armstrong spoke about the isolation he was feeling in life, in the world of cycling and with his charity, so Shur envisioned an image of “him alone in this vast natural setting.” <em>ESPN The Magazine</em> photo editor Nancy Weisman liked the idea and gave Shur the freedom to do “what I thought was best.” Armstrong was on board. <br />
        <br />
        The vibe during the shoot was relaxed and friendly, Shur says, “but when it came time to take the pictures I was definitely trying to keep in mind everything we talked about, everything I wanted to do.” She felt comfortable directing Armstrong, and as they walked in an area where he goes for runs, he suggested a location near a river that might work. “We came to the river and I saw this rock and this patch of sun, and I asked if he would sit there,” she recalls. “I felt like he understood what the picture looked like,” Shur says. “He understood where I was going with it.” That photo ran in the magazine as a double-page opener, and at the top of the full interview that was published on <a target="_blank" href="http://espn.go.com/sports/endurance/story/_/page/maginterviewarmstrong/lance-armstrong-living-more-simplified-life-espn-magazine">ESPN.com</a>. Other images of him walking on a trail and crossing a bridge also ran in the magazine, along with a tight shot of Armstrong in his home.<br />
        <br />
        Shur chose not to light the outdoor photos. “Part of doing this is sensing the vibe of the situation,” she says. Because she chose not to set up and test lights with an assistant, she says, it felt like a “walk in the woods.”<br />
        <p>The magazine had called Shur the day before Thanksgiving and asked if she would travel over the holiday weekend for the assignment. While she was reluctant, the opportunity to photograph Armstrong at an interesting point in his life for a client she likes proved worth it. “It’s such a perfect example of why I don’t like to turn down work,” Shur says. “You just never know. You could have an experience that reaffirms your faith in photography.”</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        Before he photographed actor Michael Shannon for a cover story in the men’s style magazine <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.port-magazine.com/">Port</a></em>, photographer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nadavkander.com/">Nadav Kander</a> first met with the publication’s co-founder and senior editor, Matt Willey, to discuss the portraits. They spoke about getting a variety of emotions from Shannon, who is often portrayed in a way that reflects the tough or haunted characters he has played in films like <em>Take Shelter</em> and <em>Man of Steel</em>, and the TV series <em>Boardwalk Empire</em>. Kander notes, “He’s always known as this sort of aggressive actor so [we aimed for a range], from aggression to a real softness.” Yet the photographer is quick to add that he never really knows how a shoot is going to go until the subject is on set. He prefers to let things happen intuitively. <br />
        <br />
        To prepare for the Shannon shoot, Kander, who is based in London, studied images of the actor. “Always my homework is in the face more than in the writing about the person,” he says. “I’m not that interested in Wikipedia and column inches about a person. I’m much more into how they look, which often I feel is more accurate to who a person is than what they’ve done in life.” <br />
        <br />
        Looking at photos of his subjects also helps Kander discern the type of lighting to use. On set he tweaks the lights as he goes, often not remembering exactly what he changed. For the Shannon shoot, Kander can only recall that the strobe lighting was “flat because he has a very craggy and arresting face, so I lit him quite open and just let it be.”<br />
        <br />
        What’s fresher in his mind was the atmosphere on set. He and Shannon very much collaborated on the images, with the Method actor losing himself in the work. As is his habit, Kander talked to Shannon before they began but never while he was shooting. Music was an important part of the process: They listened to the indie rock band Pavement and jazz guitarist Grant Green. “Actually <a href="http://stocklandmartelblog.com/2013/09/20/nadav-kander-photographs-actor-michael-shannon-for-port-magazines-first-word-free-cover/" target="_blank">the cover picture</a> is [Shannon] snapping his fingers to the music that he had put on and sort of going off in his own head.”<br />
        <br />
        In front of a camera, “Actors are very particular as a genre to photograph because they so understand an entertaining image—they so understand atmosphere, they so understand that there is an otherness to a picture, to a film, to a stage play,” Kander explains. “It’s not just what the words on your lips [are] or the look on your face, but there’s an atmosphere created and that sits apart from you.”<br />
        <br />
        The magazine dedicated eight pages to the article, so the photographer had to make a variety of images that required several wardrobe changes. Kander says he often worries that in fashion shoots, an actor will feel more like a model than a portrait subject. He and Willey both agreed to keep the styling to a minimum, and worked with stylist and Port Fashion Director David St. John-James who, Kander says, “has a very light touch and you feel things are not overly done.” <br />
        <br />
        Kander always strives to make portraits that feel authentic to the subject—whether they represent the person accurately or reflect the mood on set that day. For the Shannon shoot, the goal was to portray the actor in a way that felt real and not too fashion-y while avoiding clich&eacute;d representations of him. The photographer notes, “In the months after that shoot I saw so many pictures of him snarling at the camera and looking terrifying, and I was really pleased we didn’t go there.”<br />

        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.donnadecesare.com/">Donna DeCesare</a> says in her 2013 book, <em><a target="_blank" href="https://utpress.utexas.edu/index.php/books/decuns">Unsettled/Desasiego</a></em>, that she moved to El Salvador in late 1987 “to witness and report on war, with all the earnest idealism and na&iuml;vet&eacute; of youth.” Ever since, she has been exploring causes, effects, and possible solutions to a troubling legacy of Central America’s civil wars: gangs and urban violence.<br />
        <br />
        DeCesare still believes in the power of journalism to bring about change by sounding alarms of injustice. But what if things are complicated and intractable, and the story long outlasts the media’s attention span? DeCesare’s response has been to find creative ways to engage directly with audiences that care the most: her subjects, their families and communities, and others trying to help.<br />
        <br />
        She has worked with NGOs trying to help people escape gangs. She teaches workshops and sometimes coaches subjects individually to help them connect with others, gain self-confidence and see alternatives for themselves. She has created a website, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.destinyschildren.org/en">www.destinyschildren.org</a>, to tell stories about youth caught up in gang life and their efforts to escape, and to provide resources to others who want to get out.<br />
        <br />
        DeCesare has also worked with academics and public officials to explore the social and psychological causes of gang attachment and violence. Her goal is to combat stereotypes about gang members and help change draconian public policies that have (inadvertently) strengthened gangs. All the while, DeCesare has walked a fine line between journalism and advocacy.<br />

        “You have to bring your own critical thinking and perspective to the issue … but I also feel that it’s important to develop human relationships,” she says. “I don’t see that as contradictory. I think you can be detached, but in the sense that spiritual traditions talk about: that you feel empathy and compassion, and that you try do whatever you can without getting overly involved. Our role [as journalists] is to be witnesses. It’s not to be social workers.”<br />
        <br />
        DeCesare’s book traces the arc of her career in three parts, beginning with her coverage of the brutality of the civil wars of El Salvador and Guatemala during the 1980s. Her images show mostly women and children bearing up amidst the chaos and death around them. <br />
        <br />
        “I saw myself as telling the story so people in the United States would care,” she says of the motivation behind her early work. The U.S. was propping up right-wing oligarchies that were terrorizing peasants to maintain a political and economic status quo in the region. Death squads murdered with impunity those suspected of sympathizing with rebels. Boys were kidnapped and forced into the army.<br />
        <br />
        But DeCesare soon realized that things weren’t black and white. Violence begat retaliation, and victims became victimizers. “I started to feel that if we really care about changing things, it’s not just about blaming [people], but it’s also about understanding the human psyche and the human heart and what makes people behave in the way that they do, and how do we get people to change.”<br />
        <br />
        Her encounter before the end of the war in El Salvador (in the early 1990s) with a young man named Franklin Torres led to her coverage of gangs in Los Angeles. Torres’s mother had fled with him to the U.S. city when he was 11. Unschooled in American culture and unable to speak English, he was ostracized and bullied, and ended up joining a gang for comfort and protection. He was eventually deported to El Salvador, after serving time for drug crimes.<br />
        <br />
        “It struck me as ironic that someone who fled war as a refugee to find safe haven became involved in another kind of violence. That’s what I decided I wanted to find out,” DeCesare explains.<br />
        <br />
        Gang culture was entrenched in Los Angeles long before Central American war refugees arrived there. DeCesare found that gangs “filled a void” for marginalized Latin Americans who, like Torres, had limited economic prospects and troubled lives.<br />
        <br />
        As drug trafficking and the proliferation of guns made the gangs more violent, U.S. authorities cracked down by deporting gang members who were originally from Central America. DeCesare followed them with her camera back to El Salvador and Guatemala, where authorities dealt with them brutally.<br />
        <br />
        “Young people … who desperately want a chance to correct the past and build a different life find themselves isolated, vulnerable and invisible,” DeCesare writes in her book. Most deportees had to remain with the gangs for the same reason they had joined in the first place: physical and emotional protection. Attempts to suppress violence, in other words, were just breeding ever more virulent forms of it.<br />
        <br />
        Having built close relationships with many gang members, DeCesare was interested in how to break the cycle of violence in their lives. She asserts that most media coverage about gangs emphasizes the frightening manifestations: tattoos, sinister-looking men and harsh prison life. Those images show truth, but incomplete truth.<br />
        <br />
        “You don’t get a sense that they have families, they have mothers, they have kids. They grew up in situations where they had to make terrible choices at a young age. It’s very complicated,” DeCesare says. In the popular view, “The gang is evil incarnate, and every child with any kind of relationships to it must be tainted and must be [irredeemable], and that’s just wrong,” she says. “People change, and the circumstances that led them [to gang life] can change.”<br />
        <br />
        DeCesare followed a number of subjects, hoping to show how they extricated themselves and found new lives and identities. And she had already decided that she could—and should—do more to help her subjects while she was photographing in a red light district in El Salvador. “I didn’t want to take pictures and then leave,” she says. “I thought the most effective way to [help] was to help them get out of [prostitution] if they wanted to.”<br />
        <br />
        Her opportunity came when an NGO that was offering a literacy program in El Salvador asked DeCesare for help reaching the prostitutes. “I started to realize that I could be a teacher at the same time [as being a journalist],” she says.<br />
        <br />
        She continues, “[Journalism isn’t] just [about] going in aggressively and exposing things. It’s also about developing bonds of concern and compassion, and one’s own behavior can model a way of being in the world that can have an impact on that subject as well.”<br />
        <br />
        DeCesare started teaching her subjects photography, so they could tell their own stories. She also gave her subjects a measure of control over how and when she photographed them, and how she identified them.<br />
        <br />
        “When you’re victimized, one of the things you lose is a sense that you have control over anything. You feel powerless,” she says. “Making it collaborative makes it feel less invasive. It gives [subjects] the sense that they are the protagonist, and that they are directly reaching out to tell their story.”<br />
        <br />
        DeCesare also withheld her images of gang members for several years before publishing them. She explains that she didn’t want her subjects condemned forever by photographs that showed one isolated time in their lives. “I wanted to see how people change over time, the way a documentary filmmaker would.”<br />
        <br />
        She found a few success stories. One of her subjects managed to escape gang life and establish a career as an artist in Europe, for instance. DeCesare says it is essential to tell those stories, but her book ends with a palpable sense of disappointment.<br />
        <br />
        “Too many of the youths I met while making this book are now memorialized by RIP tattoos,” she writes in the epilogue. On her most recent trip to Central America, in 2011, she found a pervasive climate of fear and danger for everyone, “especially for those who have left gangs.”<br />
        <br />
        And yet, she says in our interview, “I remain hopeful.” A tenuous truce between rival gangs has held, just barely. Officials in the region—and at influential international organizations such as the World Bank—now see Central America’s gang problem as a public health issue, not just a criminal justice issue. That has opened up the possibility of promising new political approaches to dealing with gangs.<br />
        <br />
        “Things are terrible, but I think we’re sort of at a turning point where things could get better,” DeCesare says. “But it will take the effort of all concerned, working hard on many fronts.”<br />

        Jeffery Salter says that he likes to talk quietly to subjects to explain what the photo is about. Before photographing basketball player Dwyane Wade and his sons for the cover of Ebony, published after George Zimmerman was acquitted of the murder of Trayvon Martin,&nbsp; Salter told the two boys, “You’re here for the young man who can’t be here.”&nbsp;

        Trained as a photojournalist, <a href="http://jefferysalter.com/New-Work/1/" target="_blank">Jeffery Salter</a> doesn’t give his portrait subjects much direction. Instead, he views a portrait as a collaboration, and believes his role as the photographer is to engage his subjects. “I like to set the stage and wait for things to happen.” <br />
        <br />
        He continues, “You can set the tone by being low key or high key, but the most important thing is to have enthusiasm. I think when people see you have focus and enthusiasm on the set, they respond accordingly. ‘He’s here, he’s interested. I’m going to respond accordingly.’” <br />
        <br />
        For the September 2013 cover of<em> Ebony</em>, Salter was assigned to photograph Dwyane Wade, a shooting and point guard with the Miami Heat, and his two sons. The headline on the cover read “We Are Trayvon,” and it was published after a jury found George Zimmerman not guilty of the February 2012 murder of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old African-American man.<br />
        <br />
        On set with Salter, Wade and his two sons each wore a gray hooded sweatshirt, which Martin was wearing the night he was killed. Salter says he wanted the portrait “to go beyond the symbol and make a more human connection” between the viewers and the boys he was photographing. “It was important the image be more than a simple, flat, two-dimensional document. It needed to convey the gravity of the situation.” <br />
        <br />
        To engage Wade’s sons, Salter gave them access to Pandora and let them choose the music when they arrived. “That set the scene that they could just be themselves,” Salter says.<br />
        <br />
        Salter, whose clients include <em>Inc.</em>, <em>O, The Oprah Magazine</em>, <em>Sports Illustrated</em> and <em>The New York Times</em>, says that whenever he photographs subjects who aren’t used to being in front of the camera, he explains what he wants the photo to say. “I tell them, ‘I’m going to be here for a little while in your life and a lot of people are going to see the picture. I want you to relax and think about why you’re here.’”<br />
        <br />
        When Wade and his sons were in front of the camera, he told them, “‘You’re here for the young man who can’t be here.’ When I said that, I didn’t shout it. I walked up and I whispered it.”<br />
        <br />
        After that, Salter simply watched for cues. “I have to find the moment and just say, ‘Do that again,’ or ‘Hold that.’”<br />
        <br />
        Before these moments of quiet observation, however, Salter spends hours on location scouting and setup. When shooting in an office or other location, Salter usually alerts the PR people that he’ll be arriving about four hours early to look around. His goal is to find a location that helps him deliver a storytelling portrait.<br />
        <br />
        He adds, “I’m not afraid to change a location if I see something while walking the subject to the set. I ask questions, such as ‘Where do you go to relax?’ or ‘Did you drive your Harley to the office today?’” <br />
        Once he’s set up for the shoot and has the subject in front of the camera, he turns his attention to communicating his ideas for the photo.<br />
        <br />
        “I show them where I’m going,” he says. “I don’t hide anything.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        Photographer <a href="http://louiepalu.photoshelter.com/" target="_blank">Louie Palu</a>’s <em>Mira Mexico</em>, a 15 x 12-inch “conceptual newspaper” on the Mexican Drug War, forces its audience not only to confront the grisly violence of the conflict, but also to wrestle with ideas of censorship and modes of representation. “Something I like doing is blurring the lines between journalism and art,” Palu says of the project, a departure from his years of work as a photojournalist covering conflict for major media organizations. “At this stage of my career I’m not afraid to challenge myself. I’m not afraid to look in the mirror and face my own criticism.” <br />
        <br />
        The son of Italian immigrants living in Toronto, Palu grew up in a neighborhood where the power of the criminal underworld was an open secret. Organized crime was a subject that he had long wanted to explore photographically, but thought doing it in his own neighborhood would get him “knocked off, probably,” he says. After five years working on and off in Afghanistan, Palu was looking for his next move. He applied for and won a fellowship from the New American Foundation, a Washington DC-based think tank. That grant enabled Palu to take the first of what would become several trips to Mexico over a two-year span. <br />
        <br />
        “I started doing some research. I looked at how people were covering the [Mexican Drug War] and then I just [went] down [to Mexico] and started covering violence,” Palu explains. “But [my work] became something more than just understanding the violence. It was about understanding how the violence happened and what were the mitigating factors that let that violence happen.”<br />
        <br />
        He worked along the U.S.-Mexico border, wading through the bottomless depravity of America’s often forgotten drug war, eventually securing funding from the <a target="_blank" href="http://pulitzercenter.org/projects/us-mexico-border-security-immigration-issues">Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting</a>. The years Palu spent covering the Afghan war proved invaluable as he soon saw the many parallels between the conflict he had just left, a world away in Central Asia, and this one, right on North America’s doorstep. The pervasive corruption, the absence of social infrastructure, the erosion of the rule of law, the prisoners, the refugees, the dead bodies—all these things dominated the day in Mexico, but to his mind, the true scale of this conflict was going unseen in the West, particularly in the United States and Canada. <br />
        <br />
        Palu believes the bloodbath raging in Mexico is far more relevant to the interests of the United States than the conflicts in Syria or Afghanistan. “What’s going on in Mexico is much bigger than what people really understand,” Palu insists. “There are sections of Mexico that are not in the control of the government, and I’m not talking a corner—I’m talking about large swaths of territory.” <br />
        <br />
        To Palu’s eyes, Western media was largely ignoring the reign of terror in Mexico while conflicts in the Middle East dominated front-page news. That observation led him to think about how to approach the realities of the war and media coverage conceptually. “With this work, what came to mind most was how the war was being documented, talked about and represented with pictures in the media,” Palu says. “It became a project about questioning what we see, what we don’t see and who are the gatekeepers that control this.”<br />
        <br />
        Creating visibility was at the forefront of Palu’s mind when, eschewing a more traditional approach, he partnered with three different media entities to release his work in January 2013. Canada’s <em>The Globe and Mail</em>; <em>Foreign Policy</em> in the United States; and Mexico’s online news magazine Animal Politico all simultaneously published individually tailored photos and writing from Palu in their respective corners of NAFTA. For Palu, the idea was to maximize the discussion, to put Mexico’s trauma in front of as many eyes as he could and keep it there. <br />
        <br />
        The broadsheet <em><a href="http://louiepalu.photoshelter.com/gallery/Mira-Mexico/G00000HwIP1Korg8/" target="_blank">Mira Mexico</a></em> project, produced in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.newamerica.org/" target="_blank">New America Foundation</a>, was another way of expanding that dialogue. Most conflict photographers have experiences of their work being cropped or edited in a way they don’t agree with, or used in a context other than they intended. By printing and publishing <em>Mira Mexico</em> himself, Palu decided what would be included. The newspaper has been distributed at university events, museums and galleries, and limited quantities will be available online through the photo bookstore <a href="http://www.photoeye.com/bookstore/citation.cfm?catalog=ZF763&amp;i=&amp;i2=" target="_blank">photo-eye</a>. <br />
        <br />
        On one side of the paper are unflinching images from the drug war’s blood-soaked trenches: bodies lying in the short grass, wrists bound, pockets pulled out like rabbit’s ears. A needle dangles from a junkie’s hand as he bends to his task next to the Tijuana River. The rubber-gloved hands of U.S. Border Patrol agents stacking bricks of seized contraband in Laredo, Texas. But turn the paper another way and that story disappears, replaced by images of “another Mexico,” where orderly new factories churn out exportable goods in a Free Trade Zone. Children play in the waters of the Rio Grande, laborers carry their harvested produce to market and a mayor-elect beams at her ecstatic supporters celebrating a victory at the polls. <br />
        <br />
        While Palu’s newspaper allows readers to decide which side of Mexico they view and encourages them to think about the selection of images, <em>Mira Mexico</em> shows there is little distance between everyday life in Mexico and the pestilence of drugs and death. The Mexico of the hard-working peasant, the hopeful migrant, the youth at play in the slum is the same Mexico occupied by stone-faced gangsters, the sick and destitute, and the corpses of the condemned, given over to rigor mortis and left twisting in the sun. The maladies of poverty, corruption and inequality hover behind it all, the drug war the most prominent symptom. In one photograph a man with a U.S. passport waits to cross the border into the United States with his bicycle. In the background of this would-be innocuous example of open borders and cultural exchange—somewhat out of focus—a drug dog stands, tongue lolling. There is just one Mexico. Either you choose to see it all, or you don’t.<br />

        Salt Lake City photographer <a href="http://www.pier23photography.com/index2.php#/home/" target="_blank">Mark Thackeray</a> shoots mostly weddings and commercial assignments. But a little more than three years ago, after documenting his grandparents’ funerals at his mother’s request, he started marketing himself as a funeral photographer, too. &nbsp;<br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: What’s appealing to you about funeral photography? <br />
        Mark Thackeray:</strong> I like how new it is. It’s in its infancy stage. I also like it because there’s a huge range of emotions. I love capturing that, and the interactions between people. That’s why I’m drawn more to this than commercial work: This is so real and so personal. <br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: How many funerals have you documented?<br />
        MT: </strong>Twenty-five or so. <br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you market yourself?<br />
        MT: </strong>Primarily by word of mouth, and I contact people I’ve worked with in the past to generate more referrals. I’ve also approached some funeral homes to get them to include my services in some of their package options. <br />
        <br />
        It’s a new market, and a lot of people haven’t thought of it before. I use albums and DVDs to show people what it’s going to be like, and I explain that a funeral is an opportunity to relive old memories, and create more memories. It takes a series of meetings before the event, where I’ll outline my approach, and make sure everyone is on board.<br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: What is your approach?<br />
        MT:</strong> I have a journalistic approach. I like to capture things as they unfold. <br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: What concerns do potential clients have?<br />
        MT: </strong>The [idea] of someone being right up in their face while they’re viewing their loved one in the casket scares people. But once you show them, and they understand the reality, people start to open up. <br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: Walk us through a typical job. What’s the procedure? <br />
        MT: </strong>Doing your homework is the biggest thing, and that involves communicating clearly with the family. Make sure you understand what they want. Some people don’t want to be in the pictures, they just want all the detail shots, and the displays. <br />
        <br />
        I make sure I have the schedule dialed in. I’ll show up at the viewing 20 or 30 minutes early to suss out the lighting conditions, and figure out what I’m going to do. I get shots of all the details of the displays—the cards and flowers—before people arrive. Once people arrive [I get] the interaction between the people and those displays. That’s also a great time for any family photos that you’ve arranged prior to the event. <br />
        <br />
        Then I’ll spend an hour or two capturing the candids, and the faces of the people coming in. That’s another thing I’ll try to discuss with the client before I come to the event: I’ll tell a family to please let everyone know I’m going to be there taking pictures. And if there are people they want me to photograph besides the family members, I’ll ask one or two family members to point those people out to me. <br />
        <p></p>
        <p>The next day, at the service, I’ll [again] take pictures before everyone arrives. Then I’ll make sure I get pictures of the pallbearers and the hearse. I like to get pictures of them bringing the casket in, and bringing it to the graveside. And I just follow the event as it goes—the talks and tributes that different people give. I’ll ask the family during the event if there’s anything we hadn’t thought of beforehand. I like to let them know that within reason, I’ll do whatever they want.</p>
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: What are some dos and dont’s?<br />
        MT:</strong> The dos include longer lenses to maintain distance, stay in the background as much as possible so I don’t have any influence on what people are doing. In terms of interacting, it’s a conservative approach. I don’t instigate many conversations with people.<br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: Can you give us a sense of where, how far back you are, compared to a wedding job?<br />
        MT: </strong>I’d say I’m almost twice as far back as I would be at a wedding. I’ll never be closer to the casket than anyone else. And I’ll try to camouflage myself behind a display of flowers. <br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: What’s the rule about taking photographs of people who are openly grieving?<br />
        MT:</strong> A lot of people are afraid of that. I like to tell them beforehand there probably will be pictures of them where they look vulnerable. A lot of people see the value in [those pictures]: That was a trying time, and I’m glad that image shows what I was going through. But some people don’t feel comfortable with it, or with having other people see it.<br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: What about taking pictures of the deceased? Any rules about that?<br />
        MT:</strong> That’s a big one. I specifically ask them before the event: How comfortable do you feel about pictures of your loved ones in the casket? I’ll show them some examples, and say it’s a personal choice. <br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: What gear do you use? <br />
        MT: </strong>I shoot primarily with a Canon EOS 5D Mark II body and I only shoot with prime lenses so if I want to frame something differently, I have to move. That keeps me on my feet. Also, they’re faster lenses. I have a 24mm, a 50mm, an 85mm and a 135mm lens. <br />
        <br />
        In terms of light, I don’t like to bring much except my 580EX II Speedlite. I usually keep it on camera. I don’t want to be a distraction, and I want to keep it as simple as possible.<br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: What do you deliver to the client?<br />
        MT: </strong>Most of the options I offer include an album. I put photos into an online gallery so my clients can share them with family and friends, and pick out pictures for albums. It takes seven to ten days to design an album draft. <br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you charge clients?<br />
        MT:</strong> The hours of coverage are the biggest component. Albums are a big part, too, and then digital rights [so clients can] make prints on their own.<br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: What is your fee?<br />
        MT: </strong>It depends on the number of hours they opt for, but it’s usually $300 to $500 per hour.<br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: What advice would you give a photographer who approached you about getting into this niche?<br />
        MT:</strong> Be conservative in your approach. Realize the importance of the situation, and how vulnerable people are. If you can acknowledge those things and empathize, people will be open to the idea of your being there, and capturing it. <br />
        <br />
        It’s such a new thing, and people still aren’t sure about it quite yet. There’s definitely a lot of selling that needs to go on beforehand to get people on board.<br />

        Complex photo studios share a breadth of space and offerings. We investigated three—Thunder Studios, and the in-house studios for The Walt Disney Company and Time Inc.—to find out how each organization handles variables like booking clients, accommodating staff and freelance photographers, shooting simultaneously and wrangling technology that will impress even the most devoted gear heads. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Thunder Studios</strong><br />
        <br />
        <img style="float: left;" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/Green-Screen-Thunder-Studios.jpg" alt="Green screen at Thunder Studios" /><br clear="all" />
        <em>A Thunder Studios set with a green screen, which is the largest on the West Coast. Photo courtesy of Thunder Studios.</em><br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://thunderstudios.com/" target="_blank">Thunder Studios</a> epitomizes a mega studio in every sense of the word. Located in Long Beach, California, the facility, set on six acres of land, is 150,000 square feet, and accommodates 20 discrete studios, all of them rented to outside clients. <br />
        <br />
        “You can fit a lot of photographers in 150,000 square feet,” says Wendy Kjorness, the VP of sales and marketing. <br />
        <br />
        Thunder is a dream-space for the tech savvy. Best known for automotive photography, the studio is equipped to accommodate the challenges of capturing large subjects. Along with being the only studio with pre-rigged <a href="http://www.fisherlight.com/" target="_blank">Fisher Light</a> softboxes and flats, it also has a built-in turntable, as well as all of the grip and electrical equipment a production team might need. Each of the 20 studios has either two or three cycloramas, earning Thunder the title of having the most cycloramas in North America—if not the world. “We don’t really know about the competition in China,” Kjorness notes. Another record setter is the green screen, which is the largest on the West Coast. “Basically, if a photographer needs something, we can get it,” she says.<br />
        <br />
        Thunder can also accomodate product, editorial, fitness, fashion and lifestyle shoots, beauty portraits and even educational programming. Lately, the studio has been handling a lot more 360-degree photo tours for websites, which show the interiors and exteriors of cars, boats and busses. “These kinds of projects are hybrid photography-video shoots which dovetail nicely into our flourishing commercial business,” says Kjorness.<br />
        <br />
        Given the volume of clients, the studio is like a thriving hive. “There is a buzz in the air, people in all directions, moving with purpose.” Busy periods can fluctuate, but Kjorness says the time when they’re at the most capacity is the most exciting. “Those days are long, but really rewarding for us.”<br />
        <br />
        Among the freelance photographers who lease space at Thunder, a few choose to rent from the studio exclusively, making them part of what Kjorness calls the Thunder Family. Depending on the client and the project—see the sidebar to learn how Thunder keeps shoots a secret—socializing is encouraged. “We provide lounge areas for networking,” Kjorness says. She notes that many crewmembers and photographers stay in touch through social media, which often leads to future work.<br />
        <br />
        <strong><br />
        Keeping Clients’ Secrets</strong><br />
        <br />
        <img alt="Tesla car shot at Thunder Studios" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/Tesla-Tunder-Studios.jpg" style="float: left;" /><br clear="all" />

        <br />
        Given that Thunder has a number of automotive clients, they frequently host prototypes of cars and other products that cannot be unveiled to the public. Handling such shoots requires tight security, which Thunder excels at.<br />
        <br />
        When there’s a “code red,” or highly secretive shoot, the staff at Thunder doesn’t even enter the stage. Rather, they handle the security at all of the entrances to make sure that only the crew sees the product. They accomplish this by posting a 24-hour guard at the front gate to the facility, along with at the doors to the stage. Crew members use a passcode to get into the space—many times, the shoots are given fake names like those used by movie stars when they’re checking into hotels.<br />
        <br />
        The secure stages have their own private entrances so that none of the other clients or staff at Thunder can see what’s going on. The prototype is often parked on the stage for many days, so that many different types of people—public relations, photographers, commercial directors and even focus groups—can visit without the product ever having to be moved. “Everyone comes to us,” explains Kjorness.

        <strong>The Walt Disney Company</strong><br />
        <p>
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p><img alt="Walt Disney In-House Photo Studio" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/Disney-Photo-Studio.jpg" style="float: left;" /><br clear="all" />
        <br />

        <br />
        The four on-staff photographers for Disney’s Yellow Shoes Creative Group are, in simple terms, living the life. Working within the Disney corporate structure in Celebration, Florida, ensures them job security, health insurance and pensions; at the same time, the gig allows staff photographers a variety of work and creative freedom.<br />
        <br />
        “It’s like a dream freelance job only you don’t have to worry about bill collecting,” explains David Roark, the manager of creative photography at <a target="_blank" href="http://thewaltdisneycompany.com/">The Walt Disney Company</a>. <br />
        <br />
        The staff photographers are working primarily for the marketing group of Disney Destinations LLC, which means that they spend a lot of their time traveling around the world taking photographs of the empire’s many parks, resorts, and cruise ships in locations as far flung as China, Croatia, Ireland and South Africa—to name just a few destinations. &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        When they’re not in helicopters over the Adriatic, or in resorts in Shanghai, the staff photographers are working in a cavernous studio—it measures 16 x 25 feet, and has 14-foot ceilings—in the Disney marketing building. It used to serve as a storage area, but now it’s fully stocked with equipment by Nikon, which has been an official sponsor of Disney since the 1960s. “We use the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.phaseone.com/">Phase One</a> system for large-format cameras,” Roark says. “We have the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.roundshot.ch/xml_1/internet/en/application/d77/d111/f112.cfm">Seitz Roundshot D3 panoramic camera</a>, and a lot of specialty housing stops.” In terms of lighting gear, they use <a target="_blank" href="http://profoto.com/">Profoto</a> systems, along with movie lights, hazy lights and a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dino-lite.com/">Dino-Lite digital microscope</a>. The studio is set up with a cyclorama on one side, and a cove on the other. Double doors to the loading dock allow staff to move in items as large as a MINI Cooper. “It’s hardly picturesque,” laughs Roark, who says the photographers generally work independently. “None of us are particularly tidy.” &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Given that the studio services so many different aspects of Disney’s brand and programs, there is hardly any downtime. “The workload never stops,” Roark says. “We have clients who will move their projects around to wait until we have time to shoot them.” Each job comes through Account Management, located one floor up in the building. “Account Management gives the job to Creative Administration, which assigns an art director. With the writers and digital team on staff, they come up with a concept.&nbsp; Once a concept gets approved with our input, the collaboration continues on through the production.” <br />
        <br />
        As an example of the studio’s capacity, Roark cites the effort that went into a promotion about volunteering that featured Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy on the Mad Tea Party ride at the Magic Kingdom Park in Florida’s Walt Disney World. Rather than staging the set in the park itself, which is open seven days a week, Roark and his team re-created the ride in the studio using teacups that had been removed by the maintenance crew to give them new paint jobs.<br />
        <br />
        Other projects have included creating intricate miniatures of upcoming rides and resorts that have yet to be constructed. “We try to make them look as realistic as possible so that they look like the real thing,” Roark says. <br />
        <br />
        The autonomous and varied working conditions have inspired loyalty from the staff photographers; Roark has been an employee for 32 years, and some of his colleagues have been there for over 40. <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Time Inc.</strong></p>
        <p><img style="float: left;" src="/static/photoserve-xml/images/Time-Photo-Studio.jpg" alt="Time Inc In-House Photo Studio" /><br clear="all" />
        <br />
        <em>An image taken at the Time Inc. Digital Studios' Tribeca location in New York City. Photo &copy; Time Inc Digital Studio.</em><br />
        <br />
        The studio owned by the publishing arm of Time Warner, a media conglomerate that lists over 150 magazines as assets, is a busy hub for freelance photographers. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.timeinc.com/home/">Time Inc.</a> also employs five full-time staff members including a studio manager, photographer and imaging specialist. Located in the Time &amp; Life Building in midtown Manhattan, the studio is roughly 2,500 feet, and can accommodate up to five shoots a day.<br />
        <br />
        These shoots tend to be pretty small—three or four people—given that the photographers are mostly doing still lifes or portraits for editorial, or advertorial/advertising campaigns. Their subjects include products, furniture and food. The walls are movable, and if more room is needed, the studio can be expanded to create a single, open space. Along with the bays for shooting, the studio also contains a well-equipped prop room, green rooms where portrait subjects can wait for shoots, closets, conference rooms and a fully loaded kitchen.<br />
        <br />
        For any photographer who has worked for a publishing client, the equipment at the Time Inc. studios will be familiar. “We are heavy on DSLR use but also have medium- and large-format cameras,” says Studio Director Virgil Bastos. “We are a <a target="_blank" href="http://profoto.com/">Profoto</a> studio as far as lighting goes.” Although the studio specializes in still photography, they also rent out the space to production groups shooting videos. These groups bring in their own teams of grips who handle the lighting. <br />
        <br />
        Freelance photographers are generally hired by the editorial team at any given magazine, who themselves handle the booking of the studio. When photo editors choose to use the studio within the building, it’s usually because of its convenience.&nbsp; “The editors, the product, everything is here,” explains Bastos. For bigger environmental or fashion shoots, Time Inc. also has a larger studio in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan. This space, which is 5,000 square feet and full of natural light, can accommodate a minimum of three shoots a day. <br />
        <br />
        The Tribeca space is occasionally rented by outside clients. Bastos estimates that 10 to 15 percent of shoots in the space are used by clients not within the Time Warner empire. “It’s a very selective process,” he explains. “The goal of our department is to cover our costs while providing the highest level of service.” Renting the studio helps keep both spaces afloat financially. <br />
        <br />
        Given that Time Inc. works with the publishing cycle, their craziest months are September through December—but the studio bustles for most of the year. August is the only month when the staff can take <br />
        a breather.<br />
        <br />
        Few celebrities pass through the studio though, Bastos says, “We get mostly politicians, financial people, some sports people, some television personalities, but not a lot of movie stars.” They pique some interest, but are usually in and out within 15 minutes. <br />
        <br />
        The space is set up in such a way that crews from different shoots are able to interact—and in fact, Bastos encourages networking. “We want the photographers and editors to keep on coming back to shoot with us.” In the communal spaces, pantry areas and hallways, editors frequently meet new photographers. Sometimes, all it takes is exchanging a smile to start a conversation, which Bastos says can lead to future collaborations.</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        The story of any civil war is told by how its refugees speak of home. The Palestinian of 1948 speaks of a home that persists only in memory. The Yugoslavian of 1991 grieves for a home that appears on no map. The Rwandan of 1994 gestures to a home that is near, yet so far. For the Syrians of 2011, their wounds are fresh, home is tangible; anxiously they speak of patience. The idea that perhaps soon all will be returned to normal, and they will go back to the lives they knew, hangs in the air like gunpowder. <br />
        <br />
        “By the Olive Trees” is a fresh look at the ongoing Syrian Civil War by two photographers from the American West. Salt Lake City-based <a target="_blank" href="http://www.michaelfriberg.com/">Michael Friberg</a> and Denver-based <a target="_blank" href="http://www.benjaminrasmussenphoto.com/#/overview/Overview_01">Benjamin Rasmussen</a> have little previous experience documenting conflict, but their editorial photography backgrounds helped them find a distinct approach to the subject matter. <br />
        <br />
        The photographers created “By the Olive Trees,” which they published as a multimedia piece and print newspaper, by interweaving portraiture with each refugee’s personal narrative of war and exile. The work pulls its subjects from the faceless, victimized crowds of “displaced people” and restores their humanity and their agency by sharing their individual hopes and fears. While the photographers appreciate and respect traditional photojournalism, Friberg and Rasmussen credit their editorial backgrounds for providing them with the tools to present Syria’s refugees in a different light.<br />
        <br />
        “The way that we shoot for magazines, you try to photograph a subject in a way that people are going to think they are important enough to read that story,” Rasmussen explains. “We have a visual language that we use to communicate the fact that somebody is important. We wanted to take that language and use that on a group of people that no one was really paying attention to.” He points to the cover of “By the Olive Trees” as an example; in it a handsome, young man stands holding an olive branch. His clothes fit well, a fashionable shirt unbuttoned to the chest, and he holds the branch carefully, looking away, but his gaze is troubled. Friberg shot it in natural light, but the key to their approach was spending quality time with their subjects and letting the photographs become an extension of that, instead of simply following someone around taking pictures.<br />
        <br />
        The photographers had long discussed collaborating, and found a common interest as they followed the burgeoning war in Syria. “Mike sent me this NPR article that was talking about how there were 500,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan and [the number] was expected to potentially reach one million by the end of the year,” Rasmussen recalls. While both had been following the reports and images coming out of Syria since the initial uprising, that article helped them realize there was a void that perhaps they could fill. “Neither of us felt like we were seeing very much work that made us interact with the fact that these were people being affected,” Rasmussen continues. “It all felt quite impersonal.” <br />
        <br />
        Rasmussen and Friberg left for Jordan with just one concrete assignment: to create a multimedia piece for the <em>New Republic</em>’s tablet edition. In retrospect, they both see that commission as an unintended-yet-crucial component of their editing process for “By the Olive Trees.” When they returned from the Middle East, the looming <em>New Republic</em> deadline forced them to get started on editing the images and text. Having to hunker down with the <em>New Republic</em>’s creative director and make sense of all their raw material, while the ideas they had discussed in Jordan were still fresh in their minds, laid valuable groundwork for the next step.<br />
        <br />
        After the piece was published by the <em>New Republic</em>, the photographers continued to push the work, earning coverage in <em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em> and <em>M: le magazine du Monde</em>, and on the <em>TIME</em> LightBox blog. Those experiences made it clear to Friberg and Rasmussen that if they wanted to do something more expansive with the work, they would have to self-publish it. They raised over $12,000 through a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/michaelfriberg/by-the-olive-trees-stories-of-syrian-refugees">Kickstarter campaign</a> to fund a newsprint version of the project, which they are distributing for free, in bulk, through their personal networks and through the networks of their Kickstarter contributors who have volunteered to participate in the crowd distribution. It is an intriguing marriage of old media and new, one that they hope will allow a wider audience to engage with the work.<br />
        <br />
        “I would love to not print on newsprint but the idea here is to not make $80 to $100 photo books which only 200 people, who are already interacting with material like this, will ever buy,” Friberg says. “To get us out of the photo, art, editorial ghettos that we exist in, why not make something cheap? If one person interacts with this who wouldn’t have before, that is a win to me.”<br />
        <br />
        For Friberg and Rasmussen, conditions on the ground in Jordan were illuminating. In those early days of the conflict, media outlets in the West had given them the impression that the Syrian people were united in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Once they arrived in Jordan, they began to realize that the conflict was much more complicated. <br />
        <br />
        Rasmussen was mainly shooting 4 x 5, large format in natural light, while Friberg was shooting medium format and using lights, so the question of who should take a particular picture was often self-explanatory. Both men agree that the most valuable aspect of their collaboration came at the end of those long days, back in their “crappy hotel room, drinking warm whisky” when they would plot the next day’s activity and discuss the work’s growing narrative.<br />
        <br />
        Avoiding easy tropes also meant that both photographers purposely searched for subjects outside of the sprawling Zaatari refugee camp. Roughly one-quarter of the Syrian refugees in Jordan reside in the overcrowded camp, but the photographers estimate it is the source for 90 percent of reportage on the subject. Of course, it is much easier to fly into Amman and head out to a camp with 144,000 people than to try to locate the other three-quarters of the refugee population amidst the wider Jordanian populace. “We were pretty intentional about seeking out under-represented narratives, even to the extent of wasting several days trying to find pro-regime minority groups willing to talk to us,” Friberg says. It wasn’t that regime supporters didn’t exist, they were just unwilling to speak publicly. &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Still, there is a wealth of diversity to the stories told in “By the Olive Trees” and a palpable intimacy in the images that accompany them. Despite the disturbing subject matter, the project is not a grim compendium of sorrows, but a careful piece of documentation on a humanistic scale. The Syrians profiled have their own personal tales of exile and concerns for the present, their own ways of talking about home. <br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        Assisting is a time-honored way of launching a career in the photo industry--as a photographer, of course, but also as a digital tech, studio manager, or producer. Photo assisting is competitive work, however, and the key to getting steady work as an assistant is to distinguish yourself on set from the start. We asked two photographers (both of them former assistants) and a studio producer for tips about how to break in as an assistant, and get called back over and over.
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Be Professional&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>What interns and aspiring assistants often don't understand, says New York City photographer <a href="http://www.jessedittmar.com/" target="_blank">Jesse Dittmar</a>, is that livelihoods and a lot of money are at stake on photo shoots. "It's not play time, it's not, hey, I get to meet all these cool celebrities," he says. "It's real work."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So act professional if you want to get hired (and re-hired), he advises. "Send professional e-mails and invoices, talk on the phone in a professional way. Treat every meeting like it's for a $50,000 job."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Therese Gietler, who is the producer at the <a href="http://www.andybatt.com/" target="_blank">Andy Batt's studio</a> in Portland, Oregon, says assistants "have to have good phone skills and good e-mail skills" before she'll hire them, because those are good predictors of how they'll interact with clients on set.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"One [assistant] candidate answered his phone during the interview. I never hired the guy. He said, 'Oh, I gotta take this.' Really? It tells me you're going to answer the phone on set, too."</p>
        <p>Gietler recounts another assistant who decided to take off his shoes in the middle of a shoot. "Andy had to go over and tell him to put his shoes back on," she says. "I have an assistant who fell asleep on set once. It reflected on us. It's hard to make people understand until they're in the same situation--if someone shows up late, they don't look bad. I look bad as a producer."</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Show Gratitude</strong></p>
        <p>Los Angeles photographer <a href="http://arimichelson.com/#/Advertising/Advertising%201/1/thumbs" target="_blank">Ari Michelson</a> says he's often surprised (and put off) by the sense of entitlement of many aspiring photography assistants. "People are like, 'OK, I'll do you a favor, and [assist] on your shoot. How much are you going to pay me? Really? Whatever.'" If you want to work for top photographers on big jobs, he advises, consider yourself lucky and show an eagerness to work "because they can pick any other assistant" to replace you.&nbsp;</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Mind the Pecking Order</strong></p>
        <p>Photographers usually have a chain of command on set to keep the shoot running smoothly. It's their way of delegating work and avoiding the endless distractions of small decisions and problems. "I post a crew list, in order of rank, so everyone understand what the pecking order is," Gietler says. "When you have a question or a problem, you don't go to Andy. You take it to the second or third assistant. And if they don't know the answer, they know [who to ask.]"</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Focus On Your Work&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>"Your job is to do everything in your power to make the shoot easier, and help the photographer you're working for make the pictures better," Dittmar says. He goes on to explain that you can't do those things if you're on set taking pictures behind the scenes, posting to Instagram, texting your friends, flirting with models, looking over the client's shoulder, or engaging in any other tempting distractions. &nbsp;He says, "A lot of [young assistants] are looking more than doing, and that gets old quick."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Michelson says his first assistant "will go through third assistants like nobody's business" because so many novice assistants lack a work ethic. "You need that extra set of hands, but they're too busy looking through camera lens, or talking with the client, or flirting with stylist and models."&nbsp;</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Stay Away from the Digital Tech</strong></p>
        <p>This is a special corollary to the "Focus On Your Work" rule. For young assistants, it is especially tempting to look over the digital tech's shoulder. "A lot of people want to see Polaroids and I was one of those guys. You see the lights around you, and you're like, 'Oh my god, what does that look like [in the picture]? It's a natural desire to have, especially if you're trying to learn," Dittmar says. "Looking over the digital tech's and the photographer's shoulders to make a decision about how to change the lighting--that's not your job. You're not working if you're looking at the images."&nbsp;</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Hustle</strong></p>
        <p>Shoots move quickly, especially editorial shoots, and there's no reason you shouldn't be doing something at all times while on set, Dittmar says. Equipment has to be set up, broken down, and packed away. Equipment cases and vehicles have to be organized.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Learn the tasks," Dittmar advises. "Keep a check list of things that need to be done, then check it and double check it." And what if you're so new to the game that you don't yet know what all the tasks are? "Look to the first assistant and ask: What needs to be done? What can I do for you?" Dittmar says.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Working hard pays off, he says. &nbsp;"By the time I got onto Annie Leibovitz's set as a fourth assistant, I probably had put up and broken down a thousand [light] stands. I could do it automatically, and concentrate on what Annie was doing and learn, but it didn't look like [I was watching her]. Learn from photographers, and learn a lot, but make sure you're competent and that you're working for them."</p>
        <p>Michelson says he earned his places as a regular assistant for a top lifestyle photographer by hustling on set. He'd assisted a couple of times without making a peep, and says "she barely knew who I was." The third time he assisted, she needed a ladder, "so I ran across the field, grabbed a ladder, ran back, and set it up," Michelson says. "She gave me that nod of approval." After that, he traveled all over the world with her as a regular assistant, and got much of his education from her.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Never Promote Yourself on Set</strong></p>
        <p>Showing your portfolio to a client on someone else's set is a cardinal sin. "I've seen assistants get tossed for talking about their work on set," says Dittmar. And it's not always the assistant who starts the conversation. Dittmar explains: "A lot of clients think the [assistants] are all photographers. They'll say, 'Oh, what kind of photography do you do?' Deflect it. If the photographer walks by and hears you having that conversation, they won't know who initiated it. If [a client] asks you about your work, you go, 'I'm a photographer, but today I'm working as an assistant for whoever.' Deflecting those conversations is a big skill."</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Be Carful About Engaging Clients (and other non-crew)</strong></p>
        <p>Some photographers don't want their assistants interacting at all with clients. Others are OK with it, up to a point. Dittmar advises, "Be personable with the people who are paying the bills--the clients, the photographer, the agent of the photographer, anyone the photographer has a better relationship with than you do. But on set, it's always better safe than sorry, so don't engage [ie, initiate conversation with] those people unless you're sure it's OK."</p>
        <p>Michelson says he doesn't mind if assistants on his set talk to clients. "I like everybody to get along like family," he says. But he expects them to be well-mannered, and not to socialize when the light is disappearing and there's still work to be done.</p>
        <p><span style="white-space: pre;" class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></p>
        <p><strong>If You Think You Know More Than the Photographer, Hide It&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>"If you are on set as an assistant and your attitude is that that you know better than the photographer, it comes out in everything you do," Gietler says. The attitude quickly infects other crew. &nbsp;"It goes bad fast and the clients notice. The whole production just doesn't feel right. If clients are walking away with that feeling, then they don't have incentive to hire us again."</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if you notice something wrong, or something about to go wrong, quietly notify the next person up the pecking order. Any decent photographer will thank you for it after the shoot, and remember who you are.</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        “Do I need a model release?” It’s a simple question that is deceptively complex. Depending on how a photograph is used, a release isn’t always necessary. But not having one – or at least an appropriate one – when consent is required to use a person’s image can potentially create all sorts of havoc for stock agencies, art buyers and photographers. To help photographers better understand the complexities of publishing people’s likenesses, PDNOnline asked three experts to share some insight about model releases:<br />
        <p>
        <strong>Alan Capel</strong> is head of content at Alamy, a photo agency based in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom, that has a sales office in Brooklyn, New York. <br />
        <strong>Dan Heller,</strong> who is based in Santa Cruz, California, is the author of <em>A Digital Photographer’s Guide to Model Releases</em> and a former photo industry analyst who is now chief executive officer of the biotech firm Two Pore Guys. <br />
        <strong>Nancy Wolff</strong> is a partner at the law firm Cowan, DeBaets, Abrahams &amp; Sheppard in New York City. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>PDN: What are the most common mistakes you see photographers making in regard to model releases?<br />
        Capel:</strong> Not actually getting a signed document, doing things on [a] handshake. People move on and relationships break down. We’ve seen former partners wanting images removed because they claim they didn’t give consent, etc. And not putting an image of the person on the release as a clear reference.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>PDN: Do you generally recommend that photographers always get model releases because there’s a chance someone will want to use their stock photos commercially? <br />
        Capel: </strong>Where possible yes, but in many cases it’s not feasible. The type of imagery tends to dictate what’s needed. A photojournalist depicting a riot will never need a release and nor can they reasonably expect a rioter to stop and happily sign a release. But if you are setting up a shoot and the images lend themselves to advertising or promotional purposes, use models and get a release. If you use friends also get them to sign a release. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>PDN: Do you find there are many gray areas when it comes to knowing when a model release is necessary? <br />
        Capel:</strong> Yes, how long have you got? The main question is the idea that you don’t need one if the person is “unidentifiable,” but who decides what that means? I could identify a silhouette of myself or my family and close friends quite easily for example. We take the view that if you are selling for advertising/commercial purposes, it doesn’t matter if people are shot from the rear or in silhouette or distorted or even just body parts. Get a release and then you are covered. <br />
        <br />
        Also, it’s assumed a release is needed just for commercial use. An editorial feature where the subject matter may be sensitive or controversial – for example an article about anorexia or alcoholism – should also use a released image.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Heller:</strong> It's not simply about “editorial” versus “commercial” use. The actual laws, which vary by state, generally state that consent is required if the manner in which the person is portrayed can be perceived as advocating or sponsoring a product, service or an idea. These factors transcend commercial activity. For example, using an image of someone that suggests they support a non-profit company, or a religious or political point of view, may require their permission, even though no profit is made, nor does it involve a commercial product or service. Even editorial uses can result in a lawsuit if the manner in which someone is portrayed causes harm to their personal or professional life. The legal defense against such a claim is that the use of the image and/or commentary was both newsworthy and in the public’s interest to know.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>PDN: When is a model release required for editorial use? <br />
        Wolff: </strong>Editorial use is a truthful use where there’s some reasonable relationship between the photograph and the subject. The story does not have to be about the photograph, there just has to be a connection. For example, there was a case in New York where there was an article [in 1988] about how drinking caffeine increases the success of in vitro fertilization and there’s a photograph of a family with lots of kids. The family sued and said [essentially], “My children were not conceived with caffeine and in-vitro fertilization” and the court essentially said, “So what? The story talks about big families, it’s a big family, there’s a relationship. We don’t care if it’s not about you.” <br />
        <br />
        And that’s the underpinning of stock photo licensing. For editorial use you can have a database of unreleased images available for editorial use that includes documentary films, textbooks, magazine articles, newsletters, blogs and the like. <br />
        <br />
        You can’t use an editorial photograph on a cover of a novel because there wouldn’t be a relationship between the cover and the characters in the book. If you [wanted to] put a celebrity on the cover, for example, you couldn’t do that. If you put the celebrity on the cover of a magazine and there’s an article in the magazine about that celebrity, that’s fine. </p>
        <p><strong>PDN: Why do some magazine publishers require releases for cover photos?<br />
        Wolff: </strong>For business reasons many publications feel more comfortable if you have a model release [for a cover image]. But, if there’s a relationship between the cover and an article in the magazine, with case law in New York you would not need it. A lot of times releases are used to make frictionless transactions. There’s subtlety with the First Amendment, so … it’s easier to give [photo departments] rules like, “If you have a cover, get a release.”  <br />
        <strong><br />
        PDN: What advice do you have in regards to model releases for people shooting street photography? <br />
        Wolff: </strong>It isn’t illegal to take a photograph of a person in most situations unless you’re violating some other law. If a person’s in a public place or a place where you can see them, like through a window, you can take their picture. Because we have a very strong First Amendment in the United States, you’re allowed to take a picture of anyone you see on the street. That’s the whole basis of licensing images of news events and reportage, i.e. street photography, in which there are no releases. If someone’s doing something everyone can see, even if they’re sitting in a window of a restaurant, you can take a photograph of them and you’re not going to violate any law. Some states have laws, such as California, regarding long-range lenses to view someone’s private house – primarily to protect celebrities from paparazzi. <br />
        <br />
        Then if you want to sell your photos, can you sell them without a release? The act of selling something by itself is not – and most people get very confused with this – a commercial act that requires a release. The fact you make money from something doesn’t necessarily mean the ultimate use is a commercial use. Otherwise you could never license any news photographs. The New York Times would have no pictures in it other than those taken by staff. The fact that you make a sale is not what triggers whether you need a release or not; it’s the context in how that photograph is used. If you were going to make a sale of a photo of, for example, someone on the street attending a St. Patrick’s Day parade, you could sell that to magazines, newspapers, online blogs, anything as long as there’s a relationship between the photograph and a truthful news or public interest story. </p>
        <p>You could also create and sell fine-art prints because photographs are an expressive work. The First Amendment of the [U.S.] Constitution protects freedom of expression and freedom of speech, and visual images are part of speech and they’re also an expressive work of a photographer. So all the state privacy laws must be interpreted and drafted in a manner that does not overstep the boundary of the First Amendment. In the U.S., freedom of expression outweighs privacy concerns when it comes to the use of images for editorial use and expressive uses.   <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Capel:</strong> Street photography gives realism and a candid view of the world but you have to understand the limitations of how an image can be used if you don’t get releases. If you can stop passersby and explain and maybe pay them something in recognition of them signing, that’s great, but be prepared for a difficult conversation. Suspicion will have to be overcome.  </p>
        <p><strong>PDN: What if a photographer photographed someone for an editorial use but later wants to use it in a more commercial use like an ad? Does the photographer need to find the subject to get a model release? <br />
        Wolff: </strong>Whoever would want to use it in an ad would have to get the permission of the subject. If the photographer knew the subject, the photographer could help the user get permission. <br />
        There have been some interesting situations. There was a news photo of President Obama wearing a Weatherproof raincoat when he was on the Great Wall of China and [the apparel company] put it on a billboard [in 2010]. I don’t think the President would ever [sue], but he would have a legal right to sue because his likeness was being used for advertising purposes, not news. I can imagine in those situations the White House would say, “It’s our policy not to have the president in advertising, please remove it.”<br />
        <br />
        <strong>PDN: What if that image were used in a book – would the publisher need a model release? <br />
        Wolff: </strong>If the book is by a news photographer who had a history of photographing presidents, you would not need permission to put photographs of past presidents or other recognizable people in the book because the book is a First Amendment-protected use … it’s this photographer’s expressive work…If it’s an educational textbook and it’s about history and culture, and there’s a reason to have that photograph there based on the context, you would not need consent.<br />
        <br />
        If it’s a novel, so it’s not factual or it’s not the artistic expression of the photographer but it’s just a book and maybe it references China, you can’t put the picture of the president on the cover because it would be there just to sell the book and there wouldn’t be any reasonable relationship between the text in the book and the cover. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>PDN: Do public figures like actors and politicians have more or less protection than private figures?<br />
        Heller:</strong> Pragmatically, public figures must take into account the effects of their actions when they decide whether to exercise their publicity rights. Actors have a greater incentive to protect the financial value of their likeness, so they will be more assertive in legal action if their likeness is used inappropriately. By contrast, politicians have a “persona” that needs to be maintained. It wouldn't serve their political career to get into the business of suing people.<br />
        <br />
        The one area where public figures’ rights are a bit different is in the realm of First Amendment rights. Their likeness can be used for satire and other commentary – even when such images are used in commercial products – because such commentary usually trumps publicity rights.<br />
        <strong><br />
        PDN: Does the rise of “native ads,” “branded content,” or other sorts of advertorial content that’s disguised as editorial complicate things? <br />
        Wolff: </strong>Advertorials are always commercial. If the main purpose of the article is to sell a product or service, that’s commercial use and you need a release. <br />
        <br />
        Where things can blur the line, and there’s really no answer to it, is that publishers are trying to figure out how to make money online. You can have a legitimate article: for example fashion magazines always have photos of celebrities caught out walking. So what if a publisher uses technology that allows you to hover over the celebrity’s coat, and you can see where you can buy it and how much? Now, is that celebrity selling the coat? These technologies are emerging and there are no decisions on whether this is advertising or editorial. Publicity rights are state rights and can vary state to state so you could have a different type of result in, for example, California than New York.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>PDN: What’s another other gray area with digital media and releases? <br />
        Wolff:</strong> If you’re a photographer and want to publish on your website samples of your work. In a way you’re promoting yourself but then again you’re just displaying your own expressive works in which you own the copyright. By having your portfolio online do you need a release? Some people who strictly construe promotion might say yes. I think that leads to an absurd result because then only commercial photographers with releases could ever show anyone their talent and news photographers could not. Often there are no decisions on common practices because you would need to have a case filed go all the way through the court system, including an appeal, to have a decision. Otherwise, you make judgments. Most photographers maintain an online portfolio as it has become a necessary way to display previous work and attract new business. If someone were to complain, it would be easy to take down a picture. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>PDN: Is posting on social media considered publication or promotion? <br />
        Heller: </strong>Once again, context is everything. The pivotal question in publicity rights is whether someone is portrayed in a manner where a reasonable person would perceive them as supporting or advocating a product, service or political or religious point of view. This assessment transcends any and all media forms. But social media is still evolving, and complex contexts can blur interpretations. <br />
        <br />
        Currently, most such uses do not meet the traditional definition of “publishing” insofar as the laws surrounding publicity rights are concerned. There are too few cases coming to courts, and most of those are settled before judges can make rulings that establish legal precedents. California and other states are even having a hard time passing laws that allow parents of minors to force social media sites to take down images, citing both publicity and privacy laws, but so far, First Amendment advocates are prevailing.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>PDN: In what states do right of privacy laws mean photographers need to be warier about photographing people and obtaining releases? <br />
        Wolff:</strong> I think the basic law of when you would need someone’s permission for editorial versus advertising and merchandise – like faces on T-shirts – while they’re alive has similar principles. Where I think there’s a big discrepancy is after someone dies whether those rights continue. And then there’s also the litigious nature of certain celebrities since they make a lot of money out of endorsements so they and their agents are much more protective of their rights.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>PDN: There’s a prevailing mindset that photographers should always get model releases if they can. However, Dan Heller, you say photographers should instead consider the costs and benefits of getting model releases. Can you explain more?<br />
        Heller: </strong>Because a large company has a great deal of legal exposure if it were to publish an unreleased image for an ad campaign, it would be less likely to license an image from an unknown or untrusted source.  Unless you’re a well-known, trusted commercial photographer who has a track record shooting models, or are with a known company, chances are very low that you will ever license an image to a large company for high fees.<br />
        While everyone’s experience may vary, here’s the quick exercise: add up all the money you ever got from sales that you never would have gotten unless those images were released. So now think about the time, effort and overhead necessary to get all the model releases you’ve ever obtained, and add the hours you invested to catalogue and maintain a relational database of images-to-model-releases. Amortize your income and expense ratio over the years you’ve been in business.<br />
        <br />
        Chances are the return on that investment is very, very low. For anyone who doesn’t shoot models as their main profession, I would proffer that the time would be much better spent developing your business in other ways.<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <a href="http://winniewow.com/" target="_blank">Winnie Au</a> first photographed the Halloween Dog Parade in New York City’s <a href="http://www.firstrunfriends.org/" target="_blank">Tompkins Square Park</a> as part of a personal project, so she was pleased as punch when fashion, style and beauty website Refinery29 hired her to shoot it the following year.<br />
        <br />
        “This was a personal project that turned into an assignment,” Au says. “It’s always awesome when that happens.”<br />
        <br />
        Even better, the goal of the shoot for <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/" target="_blank">Refinery29</a> was pretty much the same as she envisioned it for her personal project: “To take portraits of the amazing dogs in costume at the Halloween Dog Parade.”<br />
        <br />
        Along with three assistants who helped Au set up the shoot, move equipment and wrangle the dogs, Refinery29’s Associate Photo Editor Laura Miller and Senior Photo Editor Christy Kurtz served as art directors.<br />
        <br />
        We caught up with Au to find out how she was able to prevent this successful mobile studio shoot from going to the dogs.<br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: Why did you come up with this particular concept for the shoot?<br />
        Winnie Au:</strong> The year prior to the shoot with Refinery29, I had decided to document the amazing costumes that appear every year at the Halloween Dog Parade in Tompkins Square Park. I’ve always been interested in the quirky, funny and weird things that people do, and the Halloween Dog Parade is one of those perfect blends of creativity, cuteness and craziness.<br />
        <br />
        I wanted to do something different from the street-style snapshots that people typically take at this event. So, inspired by Richard Avedon’s portraits, I set out to create an outdoor photo studio that would really make the dogs’ personalities stand out. I wanted to make really classic portraits of a really ridiculous subject matter. <br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: How far did you have to travel with your portable studio?<br />
        WA: </strong>Luckily for me, I’m based out of Brooklyn, New York, and the parade takes place in Tompkins Square Park in Manhattan, so it’s really not super far for me. The most difficult part of shooting in a park is that you really can’t drive right into the spot where you are going to be, so it’s important to have plenty of carts and wheels for moving everything. Having enough assistants is super necessary and helpful. Additionally, one of the main hurdles in setting up an outdoor photo studio in the middle of a very busy event is having access and permission. We had to work in conjunction with the First Run Friends dog park at Tompkins Square Park in order to be able to set up at the event. I started speaking with them weeks before the event in order to make sure everything would go smoothly.<br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: Explain how you were able to create a small mobile studio environment to photograph these dogs alongside a parade. Did you have to make any unexpected modifications once you were on site?<br />
        WA:</strong> The word “parade” in Halloween Dog Parade is actually misleading. The dogs don’t parade around the block or neighborhood the way we would imagine in a traditional parade. Instead, hundreds of dogs come to Tompkins Square Park, and thousands of people arrive inside the park, too. It’s basically a dog costume contest with commentators, and each dog vies to win Best in Show. We set up our mobile photo studio like a booth. Everybody would line up and wait their turn to get their photo taken.<br />
        <br />
        The logistics of shooting animals outdoors in a very crowded environment is not easy. I did a few things to keep our studio effective and also safe for the dogs. First and foremost, when you’re photographing animals, the most important thing is to have a stable backdrop that won’t fall over. It seems like a simple goal, but when you’re setting up anything on stands outdoors, it’s very easy for a little bit of wind to knock it all over. It’s also very easy for startled or confused animals to knock a set over. So we brought very strong stands and lots and lots of sandbags. I also decided to use daylight as our key light instead of strobes. This spared us from having to bring in battery-powered strobes and/or a generator. Some dogs react unhappily to strobe lighting, so I always prefer using daylight when it’s possible. The backdrop that we set up was a painted canvas that my assistants and I made. It’s pretty important to have a sturdy backdrop like this instead of a white seamless paper. Dogs move around a lot, and they tend to tear up seamless paper and make it fall over. The canvas was also washable and wipe-able, which was nice since the backdrop got really dirty as the day went on. I didn’t realize that the park would be so dirty, so we really had to sweep and wipe the backdrop in between every dog, and we had to be ready to wipe dust off the camera lenses.<br />
        <strong><br />
        <em>PDN</em>: Describe what it was like to photograph dogs in this type of environment. How were you able to get them in a (relatively) calm state to photograph them?<br />
        WA:</strong> It was very chaotic. I typically photograph dogs in their own homes or in a studio, and I purposely always schedule the dogs to be photographed one at a time, with the least amount of distractions possible, not around lots of other dogs or people. The Halloween Dog Parade is exactly the opposite of this. It’s loud; it’s crowded; there are dogs everywhere, distractions everywhere, people everywhere. There’s a lot of crazy energy and most dogs have trouble focusing. We purposely set up the studio to face away from all of the chaos of the Halloween Dog Parade. We also set up solid fabrics to the right and left of our backdrop, basically for lighting and also to make the studio as enclosed and private as possible. I wanted to make sure that once I was photographing the dogs, they would only see me and their owners. Once the dogs stepped into our studio, I would shoot about ten to 20 frames. The owners would be there to help wrangle and get them to sit. We had plenty of treats available. And I had to shoot pretty quickly.<br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: What gear did you bring and why?<br />
        WA:</strong> My inspiration for this shoot was to do something very classic, like what Avedon used to do on the road. I wanted to use daylight but knew we would be in a fairly open space so we would just need to manipulate the light to what we wanted. Our backdrop was a simple canvas painted white (clamped to a crossbar held up by C-stands and weighed down with sandbags), and then we basically created a giant top and front-lit light box. We put black fabric on the right and left of the dogs and a big silk on top to diffuse the light. We had one more 6 x 6-foot frame and silk in front to diffuse the direct sunlight which kept moving, and voila, beautiful outdoor photo studio. Additionally we brought cleaning supplies for the backdrop, treats for the dogs and a laptop with an external battery that I shot tethered to.<br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: Were there any specific lighting concerns?  <br />
        WA: </strong>The most annoying thing about using daylight as your key light is that it moves and changes throughout the day. The great thing was that we weren’t reliant on battery power or limited by strobe recycle times, but we did have to keep moving our silks around to diffuse the harder sunlight. <br />
        <br />
        Overall it wasn’t too difficult a lighting situation. Luckily dogs are small enough in scale that your equipment doesn’t have to be as large as it would need to be for humans. With dogs I like to keep the situation as simple and easy to adjust as possible. The biggest trick to photographing animals is to make sure that your environment won’t hinder you or that it’s quickly adaptable. In other words, once you have your subject in front of you, you want to be able to focus only on capturing the cuteness. Dogs don’t like to stay in one spot and they’re pretty unpredictable, especially in this type of situation, so the best thing you can do as a photographer is to create a situation that is easy to shoot in. Hence I went with an even-lighting scenario and tried to make my backdrop big enough so that the dogs could move around within the space comfortably.<br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: What was the biggest challenge you faced and how did you resolve it?<br />
        WA:</strong> First off, your subject matter is dogs, which is always a challenge in itself. Getting the dogs to stay in one spot, especially one specific spot right on your backdrop, is never easy. But usually the owners and treats go a long way to make this happen. In this case, we had to make sure we captured each costume at its best angle, so you could understand what it was, and still see how cute the dog underneath was. And the hardest part about this particular shoot was the sheer volume of dogs and people around. I shot about 85 dogs in four hours, and I usually shoot about one dog in two hours. So that was crazy …<br />
        <br />
        When we arrived at the shoot, one of the veteran event photographers warned us to make sure no dog peed on our set. “If one does, they all will,” he told us. Fair enough warning. We were lucky, and there weren’t any accidents during the shoot for us to deal with. We made it the entire day without having our set peed on by any dogs, until the very, very end, after we broke down everything, a tiny little dog decided to come by and pee on one of our sandbags. We were so close!<br />

        <strong>Client:</strong><em> Real Simple</em><br />
        <strong> Photo Editor:</strong> Lauren Epstein <br />
        <strong>Art Director:</strong> Abbey Kuster-Prokell<br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://www.joyce-lee.com/" target="_blank">Joyce Lee</a> likes to create still lifes that tell stories. The photographer, whose clients include <em>Martha Stewart Living</em>, Herm&egrave;s and Kate Spade for Bloomingdale’s, often finds a way to suggest a person has just stepped away from the scene. When it comes to planning her lighting, she says, “All of my images are based around an actual time of day. I want people to be reminded of a time and place when they see my work.” <br />
        <p></p>
        <p>An assignment to shoot a story for <em>Real Simple </em>on “easy summer entertaining” called for her to create a fun image of a backyard party taking place in dappled sunlight. “I wanted to give the feeling of life and celebration through the colors, textures and light,” says Lee. “With the photo editor’s request for a ‘summer light’ look, I knew we needed bright colors and natural light if possible. I love working with natural light, which isn’t always possible, but I wanted to try for this shoot.”</p>
        As back up, she brought strobes to the location, but was fortunate to have lots of sunlight—so much, in fact, that she had to modify the light to make sure the bright colors of the food and the model’s clothes didn’t wash out. She had a different problem when she was shooting a still life on electronics for <em>Esquire</em> magazine’s <em>The Big Black Book</em>. She wanted to suggest mid-afternoon sunlight—but she also needed to shoot in a windowless studio. She created the illusion of window light using monolights and modifiers.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Logistics </strong><br />
        For the <em>Real Simple</em> shoot, Lee found a house in Bellport, New York, that had a backyard pool surrounded by white poured concrete. She worked with Judy Sillen at Allencrest Locations who negotiated the usage and got the owners to agree to fill the pool, though the shoot took place on a brisk April day. <br />
        <br />
        “The goal was to make the images feel like there was a full party happening but with only one model in each shot,” Lee notes. Because it couldn’t look like a fashion shot, she wanted the model’s face to be obscured. <br />
        <br />
        “I had purchased a colorful raffia hat for the shoot, which ended up working nicely for this shot. The red fringe played off the red accents on the table and it covered her face in a fun way.” She also used a ladder, and stood on the second and third steps to get images looking down on the model, so her full face wasn’t visible. <br />
        <br />
        Prop stylist Martha Bernabe and food stylist Cyd McDowell laid the patio table as if for multiple guests. Lee had to direct the model to chat with imaginary companions: “I explained to the model that she was the host of a party and to imagine talking to someone across from her at the table,” she says. “I’d say: Pretend like you’re engaged in conversation. OK, now laugh.” <br />
        <br />
        Lee says that while she wanted the image to capture the casual fun of a backyard party, she had in mind a classic Irving Penn image of a “caf&eacute; society” woman and a “Fifties notion” of effortless entertaining, “just this fabulous spread and the lady of the house is looking gorgeous and not at all overworked.”<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Lighting</strong><br />
        “I wanted to try and use as much natural light as possible and have longer shadows on the table for a sunny afternoon feel,” the photographer notes. The shoot was set up by 1 PM, Lee recalls. “The sun was almost directly overhead at that point.” After doing some test shots, Lee determined the sun was too bright, making the food look unappetizing. <br />
        <br />
        To soften the light on the scene, she placed a 6 x 6-foot scrim with a full-stop silk on C-stands about three to four feet behind the model and the table. The scrim was a little short, but the model conveniently blocked one of the C-stands. She also had an assistant hold two 42-inch disk reflectors (one gold, one silver) directly behind the ladder on which Lee was standing to bounce light back towards the model. “We were able to take full advantage of the natural light with just a few simple pieces of equipment,” Lee says. “It was kind of like when you first start taking photos with just your camera and a reflector. It was a return to that, but slightly more sophisticated.”<br />
        <br />
        For <em>Esquire</em> magazine’s <em>The Big Black Book</em>, Lee photographed electronic equipment arranged on busts in a studio. “I wanted to have a controlled setting since electronics require involved lighting.” Still, she wanted the image to have bright colors and the look of mid-afternoon shadows. She used <a href="http://www.elinchrom.us/style-500-500ws-bxri-multi-voltage-compact-flash-unit" target="_blank">Elinchrom BXRi 500 monolights</a>. At camera left, about four feet from the props, she set up one light with a large softbox to provide fill. A gridded light at camera right, about three feet from the props, created the dark shadow cast by the bust onto the wall, and then she added a third light with a reflector. “A 4 x 4-foot wood cucoloris was placed on a C-stand about two feet in front of the light with a reflector,” Lee recalls. She says a cucoloris “is great for creating a window-light feel by adding shadows and depth.” She also used a silver card to highlight some areas of the electronics. <br />
        <strong><br />
        Camera</strong><br />
        Lee shot the outdoor image for <em>Real Simple</em> with a <a href="http://www.phaseone.com/Camera-Systems/645DFplus.aspx" target="_blank">Phase One 645DF</a> body, <a href="/PDN-Product-Review--3149.shtml">IQ140</a> back and 55mm lens at f/16, ISO 100, 1/200 of a second. The medium-format digital camera “was a great choice due to its sharpness.” She shot tethered, using <a href="/Software-Review-Pha-9363.shtml">Capture One software</a>, with the monitor sitting on the grass near the model. <br />
        <strong><br />
        Post-Production</strong><br />
        “I tend to do a lot of my own retouching,” Lee says. She removed the leg of a C-stand visible through a water pitcher on the patio table. To remove the goose bumps that appeared on the model’s bare arm in the 55-degree weather, Lee turned to photographer <a href="http://www.emilymalan.com/" target="_blank">Emily Malan</a>, “who is great at retouching skin.” <br />
        <br />
        Lauren Epstein, photo editor at<em> Real Simple</em>, had told Lee she wanted the images to look “100 percent like my work,” Lee says. “I believe clients hire me because they want a polished look but without it being too perfect.” With the help of a sunny day and a few tricks, she was able to deliver.<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        When photographer <a href="http://www.jaylclendenin.com/" target="_blank">Jay L. Clendenin</a> was assigned to shoot celebrity portraits at the 2013 <a href="http://www.sundance.org/festival/" target="_blank">Sundance Film Festival</a> in Park City, Utah, for the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, he knew just what he wanted to bring: backdrops, tons and tons of different backdrops. The challenge was getting all these backdrops, along with his regular collection of photo gear, to Park City and finding a quiet space to photograph celebrities during the hectic festival. In the end he was able to convince the <em>LA Times</em> to set up its own temporary studio at Sundance for the paper’s photo and video shoots.<br />
        <br />
        “I did a lot of persuading of<em> LA Times</em> Director of Photography Calvin Hom, as the Times had never had a studio at Sundance,” Clendenin says. “Film Editor Julie Makinen was on board immediately and helped maintain a Google Doc of our schedule with all the attending publicists and their talent. Sunday Calendar Photo Editor Cindy Hively kept us alive in the paper, helping usher our online galleries as well as a page of portraits in the Sunday Calendar the final weekend of the festival.”<br />
        <br />
        Even with the temporary studio, Clendenin’s mobile portrait sessions—over 100 in all—were ambitious. He filled us in on how he was able to pull it off.<br />
        <strong><br />
        <em>PDN</em>: Why did you come up with this particular concept for the shoot?<br />
        Jay L. Clendenin:</strong> I knew I’d be shooting more than 100 portraits and wanted to bring multiple backgrounds. Over the last couple of years, I’ve been using pieces of fabric, approximately 4 x 9-foot for Calendar section portraits, and figured I’d do the same at Sundance, but needed a way to have them up all the time, where I could move between them quickly during five-minute shoots. Asking around, friends pointed me in the direction of New York City-based photographer <a href="http://www.victoriawill.com/" target="_blank">Victoria Will</a> and how she had wrapped foam core with fabrics at a previous Sundance. I took the idea and ran with it, creating ten movable backgrounds with 8 x 4-foot foam core and a collection of fabrics used for single portraits, and then my nine-foot-wide cloth background for groups.<br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: How far did you have to travel to set this shoot up? Were there any specific logistical concerns?<br />
        JLC: </strong>We were able to ship our 8 x 4-foot foam core and lighting gear by truck from LA to Park City. <br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: Describe the temporary studio you used for your portrait shoots during Sundance.<br />
        JLC:</strong> The<em> LA Times </em>photo and video studio took over an empty business space, ground level, below the Park City town ski lift. The Village at the Lift is a traditional destination during the Sundance Film Festival, where there are several sponsored spaces as well as a handful of photo studios. We weren’t technically part of the Village as we didn’t have a sponsor, but since we cover so much of Hollywood and bring several writers, publicists were making us part of their photo plans, filling my six days there from 9 AM to 6 PM. To my knowledge, this space had never been used as a studio, as it had been occupied in previous years. The location was ideal, as publicists could bring their talent to us first (scheduled in advance) on the ground level and then make their way upstairs to see other studios and sponsored lounges where gift bags and swag could be had. <br />
        <br />
        In this empty business space, I set up my studio in a room, approximately 12 x 15 feet, while our videographer, <a href="http://www.myungchunphotography.com/" target="_blank">Myung J. Chun</a>, utilized a room at the back of the business, approximately 10 x 10 feet. I had one window on Main Street, but because it would potentially draw too much attention, I decided to give up my one source of natural light and just use my lighting gear. By Saturday of the first weekend of the festival, our third day of shooting, we consistently had a large gathering outside of fans and some entertainment photographers (paparazzi?!), which meant our one security guard would help escort the talent into our space and then out a back route to their next venue. <br />
        <br />
        For a first-time studio, we felt it was a home run. We had a full schedule every day and have been using the pictures throughout the whole year, and are in the process of making arrangements for our 2014 studio.<br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: How did you source the different backdrops you used for these portraits? How portable or heavy was this setup?<br />
        JLC:</strong> I have been shopping for fabrics in the fashion district of downtown Los Angeles for a couple of years now. I shoot a lot of celebrity portraits for the <em>LA Times</em> and after wearing out all the local hotels’ wallpapers and curtains, I needed more cost-effective ways to add backgrounds to my bag of tricks, besides buying a new nine-foot muslin every week! The fabrics offer a great variety, some two-sided, with the most expensive only being around $20 per yard, with three yards being sufficient. For Sundance, I utilized five backgrounds my wife [<a href="http://www.nancypastor.com/" target="_blank">Nancy Pastor</a>, who is also a photographer] had been using and was able to buy five more, for ten movable (once mounted to the foam core), along with one nine-foot, black, patterned, Savage fabric. I had the movable backgrounds up against two walls and shifted them depending on what someone was wearing, trying to make the best match on the spot. In total, two walls of the room were used for shooting against.<br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: Describe some of the planning behind the setup. Did you have to make an unexpected adaptation or modification once you were on site?<br />
        JLC:</strong> Once I had ten backgrounds picked, I wanted to do a quick test shoot in the <em>LA Times</em> studio. One of the biggest hurdles was how best to secure the fabrics over the foam core. I tried gaffer tape, but soon switched to an office binder clip, securing the fabric over the edges of the foam core. After the successful test, being able to slide the backgrounds in and out of a small area, I rolled all the fabrics up and then spent two hours with our shipping department building a hard-edged box to protect the sheets of foam core during shipping. In Park City, one day before the official start of the festival, I was building out my “studio,” steaming all the fabrics and getting everything in place. <br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: What gear did you bring and why?<br />
        JLC: </strong>I brought an assortment of gear to make this studio work. While the majority of my shooting was done on a <a href="/Camera-Review-Canon-5887.shtml">Canon EOS 5D Mark III</a>, with the new <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ef_24_70mm_f_2_8l_ii_usm" target="_blank">EF 24-70mm f/2.8 II USM lens</a>, I also used a Canon EOS 5D Mark II, with a <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ts_e_45mm_f_2_8" target="_blank">Canon TS-E 45mm f/2.8 tilt-shift lens</a>, and a <a href="/Object-of-Desire-Fu-9690.shtml">Fujifilm Instax</a> to make a collection of instant prints and give some away. <br />
        <br />
        I used two <a href="http://savageuniversal.com/products/background-stands/port-a-stand" target="_blank">Savage Port-A-Stand</a> background kits, which I leaned my ten movable backgrounds against [so they would] stand flat for shoots. My large, black, fabric background was supported by a <a href="http://www.manfrotto.us/black-adjustable-background-holder-crossbar-for-9-paper" target="_blank">Manfrotto crossbar</a> and two nine-foot stands. Because I was utilizing two walls, my lighting was situated pretty central to the room, where I would be shooting past the softboxes. For lighting the large, black background, I used one medium <a href="http://www.chimeralighting.com/" target="_blank">Chimera</a> softbox, boomed, overhead, with a second small Chimera box below when I felt I needed the extra fill. On the wall of movable backgrounds, I was using two medium strip boxes by Chimera. For lighting power, I was using two <a href="http://www.dynalite.com/power-packs/" target="_blank">Dynalite 1000w/s packs</a>, one for each setup.<br />
        <br />
        Another very important part of my equipment list was a <a href="https://jawbone.com/speakers/jambox" target="_blank">Jawbone Jambox</a>, attached to a Sundance specific playlist on my iPad, which provided us with great sound during our 12-hour days at the studio.<br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: Were there any specific lighting concerns? &nbsp;<br />
        JLC: </strong>My biggest concern was getting a high enough ceiling for my lighting ideas. Luckily, the location we secured had ten-foot ceilings, minus a giant hanging light in the middle of the room, where I would be standing. My goal was to have the light coming from above for my groups, as the space was tight and I wanted to be able to move more easily around the room. I boomed that softbox from behind my shooting position, over my left shoulder, allowing me to move to the left wall to swap out the moveable backgrounds. For the second shooting wall of movable backgrounds, I shot between the two strip softboxes.<br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: What was the biggest challenge you faced and how did you resolve it?</strong><strong><br />
        JLC:</strong> Other than the very short shoot times (most individual portraits were under five minutes, producing less than 40 frames between two cameras) and some rowdy groups that, at times, tested my patience as well as the small space, I think getting everything into that room and being able to move around efficiently was the biggest challenge I had to overcome at this first <em>LA Times</em> photo studio. We’re looking at the space again now and trying to figure out how to make it better for next time. I’m already getting a headache from it.

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        Master photographer and teacher <a href="http://www.pacemacgill.com/selected_works/artist_page.php?artist=Emmet%20Gowin" target="_blank">Emmet Gowin</a>, whose new book is excerpted in the article "<a href="/Emmet-Gowin-A-Photo-10381.shtml">Emmet Gowin: A Photographer’s Path to Seeing</a>," was influenced by a number of photographers, among them Diane Arbus, Eug&egrave;ne Atget, Walker Evans and Ralph Eugene Meatyard. But none shaped Gowin’s work and career like <a href="http://www.pacemacgill.com/selected_works/artist_page.php?artist=Harry+Callahan" target="_blank">Harry Callahan</a>, who became his teacher and mentor when Gowin enrolled at the Rhode Island School of Design in 1965. They remained close friends until Callahan’s death in 1999, and Gowin still speaks of Callahan with reverence and appreciation.<br />
        <br />
        “There’s so much to say about Callahan,” Gowin said in a 2009 talk that is reproduced in <a href="http://www.aperture.org/shop/books/emmet-gowin-books-2817" target="_blank">his new book</a>. He recounts how someone once approached Callahan at an exhibition to ask what the photographer was trying to say with the negative and positive space in a particular photograph. Callahan dismissed the questioner, explaining, “I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m just not that kind of guy.” Gowin said, “For me, his directness was beautiful, if sometimes unnerving.”<br />
        <br />
        Gowin’s work is informed by painstaking effort and patience, and he credits Callahan with reinforcing those qualities. He recounts how Callahan once told him, “Really, there’s no difference between us except I’ve made more bad pictures than you have.” Gowin said Callahan let that sink in before adding: “And, of course, I made more good ones, too.” Then Callahan told Gowin the story of how he had apologized to Edward Steichen for having  just one image to show for an entire year’s worth of effort. Steichen gave that image a look and told Callahan, “This was worth a year.” &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Another lesson—and perhaps a more elusive one—that Gowin said he learned from Callahan was the importance of a subject’s emotional resonance with a photographer, and the photographer’s awareness of that resonance. Early on, when he was in graduate school, Gowin had shot some street photographs in the style of Callahan’s earlier work. Callahan looked, and according to Gowin, said: “I wish I could’ve done all of those. There was a time I could have, and now I can never go back to where I was.”<br />
        <br />
        “This is a very important thing for young artists to know,” Gowin said, “to be in the time and place which is appropriate. That which is appropriate—which is to say, that which is your property. Something is proper to me, it’s right for me, it’s near my core, it belongs to my emotional orientation.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[<em>More than a decade ago, photographer <a href="http://notifbutwhen.com/">Brian Ulrich</a>, then a graduate student, began creating a body of work that examined American consumerism as a reflection of our culture as a whole. He started by surreptitiously photographing middle-class shoppers at malls, and at large chain retailers like Target and Home Depot for a series titled "Retail." Later, for the series "Thrift," he photographed thrift stores “as a narrative for poverty.” And as the country descended into the Great Recession, Ulrich traveled around the country photographing abandoned stores and shopping malls for a series titled "Dark Stores."</em>
<p><em>Ulrich exhibited his work extensively before opening a retrospective exhibition, “Brian Ulrich: Copia—Retail, Thrift, and Dark Stores, 2001–11,” at the Cleveland Museum of Art in 2011 and publishing a monograph with Aperture. The exhibition traveled to the North Carolina Museum of Art in 2012, and is currently showing at the <a href="http://www.marquette.edu/haggerty/exhibit_2014_01_Ulrich.shtml">Haggerty Museum of Art at Marquette University</a> in Milwaukee, WI.</em></p>
<p><em>Over the decade, the project has lead Ulrich to unexpected places, and opened a variety of opportunities and assignments for him. Since the first retrospective opened, Ulrich has added new twists to his project: “Relics” includes objects and archival images from malls and other retail stores;  “Great Prosperity” includes press negatives Ulrich found by trolling eBay. “There are these wonderful 12” x 5” negatives from various press archives that are really powerful [and] described the period from post-World War II up until the late 60s,” Ulrich says. “You see the whole arc of the manufacture of desire, the middle class boom, this huge economic growth.”</em></p>
<p>PDN<em> spoke with Ulrich on the day his exhibition opened at the Haggerty Museum to find out how he created, funded and found an audience for his work.</em></p>
<p><strong>PDN: How did you develop your visual strategy for "Retail"?</strong></p>
<p>Brian Ulrich: Initially it was a very practical thing. I didn’t have permission to [make photographs in retail stores]. And I wanted to make pictures that were surreptitious and candid, because I was really interested narratives that arise from careful examination – in this case ones that examined the subtle moments between purchaser/buyer, need and desire, the environment of the store and the resulting behavior it shaped. I also loved the fact that the photographs can really allow you to scrutinize the consumer experience, which is not an experience meant to looked at in that manner. There was a lot of trial and error in the beginning to come across a process that worked, which ended up with simply using a medium-format camera with a waist-level viewfinder.</p>
<p ><strong>PDN: What about the medium-format, surreptitious images you were creating worked for you visually and conceptually?</strong></p>
<p>BU: There was a vibration between an almost interior landscape picture and an intense and personal picture in which we’re right up front to an individual and we can really reflect on them in that space. Even the vantage point of the camera is in line with where you would be if you were standing there. That came from a strategy of sitting in one place and picking a great backdrop, and waiting for something to come into that space and occur.</p>
<p>The other thing that was important to me in "Retail," was that the pictures achieved an optical fidelity. I wanted you to feel as if you were really there and were able to examine and scrutinize.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: How did you approach "Thrift"?</strong></p>
<p>BU: "Thrift" changed things, because the stores were happy to let me come in and make pictures; they understood why I would want to do that. But there was also the problem of photographing junk and throwaways, and how do you do that in a way that asks people to really consider it? So that’s where the 4x5 camera started to take over, and I could spend a lot more time and work much more in a language of still life [and] portraiture.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: How did your portraiture change from "Retail" to "Thrift"?</strong></p>
<p>BU: I realized the main characters of the Thrift series [weren’t] the shoppers, but [rather] the people who worked in the places, who were volunteers, or who were working off a community service [sentence] for petty crime or something. Or even kids who felt like they were activists working at these places to deal with the environmental problems—those people are receiving this massive amount of goods and their job is to determine whether or not [something] has value. They seemed [to be] the important people in that narrative. Those portraits became much more studied and much more related to classic portraiture.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: When did you decide the next step in the project would be to photograph the "Dark Stores"?</strong></p>
<p>BU: That was an idea that I remember writing down when I started "Thrift." [Those photographs] were in many ways based on a similar principle, which was [that an] economic system that is based on [constant] growth is bound to have this fallout. I remember writing that the logical conclusion of the project would be the stores shuttered and closed. But "Thrift" is a part of that too, because …it’s where everything that was shiny and new ends up…. which is also representative of the ideas of planned obsolescence and of course representative of different economies. ["Thrift" also] talks about the way our relationship to objects changes so rapidly. The idea that an object is used and therefore loses a certain degree of aura or desire is really interesting to me. That idea also factors into the "Dark Stores," because it’s not just an object that loses its aura, but an actual architectural site.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: What is the significance of pattern and repetition in your images?</strong></p>
<p>BU: What started to become really apparent to me at the beginning of this project, but also as a person living in the world, is that cultures get really homogenized and it’s specifically tied to this way in which retail culture and consumer culture have expanded, so that the Target in Indiana is no different than the Target in Washington State or Schenectady or wherever.</p>
<p>In Chicago they recently opened up a Target in the former Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building, this amazing, fantastic architectural feat, a [Louis] Sullivan building. I was kind of excited by the idea of what Target could do in that space because it’s so unique. And when you go inside they basically made it a Target, which is to say that even the wonderfully art deco, ornate columns have been spray painted white so that they disappear into the glowing-box light of the space. [My] emphasis on form and repetition comes from all that. It was important to use that idea, especially in "Retail" and throughout the whole series, whether it's the patternation of the computer monitor pile in the "Thrift" pictures, or the rows of wire hangers, or in the facades of the buildings themselves [in Dark Stores].</p>
<p><strong>PDN: You also use a lot of signage in your compositions. When did you develop that?</strong></p>
<p>BU: I remember when I was still in grad school, which is where this project began, one of my professors, Bob Thall, used to give me a really hard time about cropping text. He said, “You’re not paying attention enough to everything that’s happening in the frame.” All of a sudden it was this idea: “Wait a second, yeah, there are all these messages happening.”</p>
<p>The messages become really important, because that is one of the most obvious strategies for trying to effect or manipulate or transform the experience of not just the consumer, but also the people who work in the place. We got the title of the book from the specific photograph where you’re in a back room looking at these doors that lead out to the showroom and somebody has crudely stenciled “Is this place great or what!” over the doors. And it’s not a question for them, it’s an exclamation mark. Which fascinates me to no end, not just because of what it is and how wonderfully esthetic it looks, but also the idea: How do you convince people for minimum wage to not just do their job well but to believe in an ideology? That’s where the text becomes huge, and it goes all the way, even into "Thrift" and certainly into "Dark Stores," which was a kind of fun way to flip it on itself, because in some cases the text was still there even when it was removed.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: Have you had any complaints from subjects of your "Retail" photographs?</strong></p>
<p>BU: I’ve been pretty lucky in that regard, I guess. I think part of that comes from the fact that I’m not trying to point out any duped shopper. This project is certainly not about trying to shame anyone. Not only do I not find that all that interesting, I think it’s kind of a horrible use of photography—the whole “people of Walmart” thing—but I also don’t think that’s an effective strategy to get people to think about their own role in these environments.</p>
<p>So I really do try to make the pictures, especially with people in them, look beautiful in a photographic, artistic, esthetic sense, where there is something to them or they do function like portraits [that make] you want to know more about the person, because that’s of course what pulls us into the narrative of the picture.</p>
<p>I think the “people of Walmart” thing is just this ridiculously rampant poverty-shaming that’s going on, and unfortunately that kind of stuff happens a lot.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: The show that originated at the Cleveland Art Museum in 2011 is currently up at the Haggerty Museum, and the work continues to resonate with people. Why do you think it’s had this longevity?</strong></p>
<p>BU: One of the reasons that it initially had such a big impact with people was because [retail shopping is] such a common experience. I don’t know if I would lay claim to this necessarily, but I don’t know if people had seen a comprehensive version of what that looked like, and what it looked like in such a specific and esthetic way. It seemed to reverberate with people from when I put my first website together [in 2004]. The "Dark Stores" were probably the most difficult. When we started showing that work in 2008 and 2009, people had a hard time looking at it, because it was so indictive. But now there’s this distance between it [and present day]. I can only imagine what the project will look like in 15 years. It’s the first decade of the 21st century; even that is interesting.</p>
<p>For a time I worked at the Howard Greenberg Gallery and I used to just stay late every night digging through all those archives of photographers’ work, and it was such a powerful lesson that these things could slowly add up to something, and it could slowly transform over time. And some work needs a lot of time. I like how that happens, I like how the work changes.</p>
<p>There’s another part, specifically with my project, where we have such a connection to these places because they’re so embedded into our consciousness, they’re so much of our environment. It’s why we feel a little bit sad about the "Dark Stores." I don’t necessarily feel that bad about them, but I do understand why some people say that…. These are the places where we all congregate and get together. This is where the human experience happens, and that’s why it is a kind of interesting indicator of what’s happening in US culture and of course how this idea of American culture has been exported or has been looked at or transformed into others’ cultures over time.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: What have been the keys to getting the work supported?</strong></p>
<p>BU: I’ve been very lucky in that regard. It’s very important to me for the work to have a life, so I’ve always worked hard to have the work exist in all these different conversations, not just [those about] photography. The work talks about economics, it talks about sociology and anthropology, and so I want to have conversations with people who are interested in that as well as art and photography.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: Did you just reach out to people in each field that might have an interest?</strong></p>
<p>BU: Yes, what’s been interesting about digital culture, or what some people call convergence culture, is that we have access to so many different specialists that have a lot of information about something. That could be the dead mall, or the psychology of the consumer from an advertising point of view, or it can be about architecture, it could be about commercial real estate. My work is tapping into all that stuff, so I want to reach out to people and ask them what they think. That’s been a really big part of how the work has lived in the world, it takes a lot of research. But it’s also really gratifying when it works because the work changes and gets informed.</p>
<p>In terms of support, this whole project—the book that was published by Aperture and the exhibition that started at the Cleveland Museum of Art—really came from two people, Fred and Laura Bidwell, two collectors in northeast Ohio. I met them originally because they sponsored a lecture series at the University of Akron in Akron, Ohio, where I went to undergrad. They brought me to do a lecture there, and that started the conversation. Fred’s in advertising so we had a lot to talk about. We developed a relationship over time and [they] would visit the studio once in a while when I was still in Chicago. In 2010 I was at Fotofest in Houston and Fred was there with [Cleveland Art Museum photography curator] Barbara Tannenbaum. I showed them the early version of a maquette of the book and Fred was like, “Well let’s do this.” And I was like, “I was told it’s not supposed to be that easy.” Which of course it wasn’t. The actual making of the book and the prints is one of the craziest experiences I’ve gone through.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: You also won a Guggenheim Fellowship. Were there other important grants?</strong></p>
<p>BU: The Guggenheim was one of the first really big things in that sense. Other than that, there was an Illinois Arts Council grant. There was a small grant that I received while I was at Columbia College as a student, a Jack Jaffee Award, which sponsors graduate research there. But really not a lot. My work’s very comprehensive, so in that sense it’s always been difficult to summarize it in whatever the required small amount of pictures are for a grant [application]. Or perhaps I’m really not good a writing about my work. But I haven’t had the best grant luck.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: Except for that one.</strong></p>
<p>BU: Except for one of the best. That was quite an affirmation to get [a Guggenheim Fellowship]. When I got out of grad school I got some really great advice from a woman named Sarah Hasted, who is a photography dealer now: “It doesn’t matter if they don’t like it, just show it to them.” So I would make trips to New York and just try and get the work in front of people and it didn’t necessarily matter if it was editorial or if it was an art gallery or it was a collector. It was a kind of introduction. It didn’t necessarily matter if they said they didn’t like it or want to do anything with it at the time. A lot of great things came out of those meetings. Early on the <em>New York Times Magazine</em> was super supportive, Kathy Ryan, and at the time Kira Pollock [now at <em>TIME</em>] was there, and they were just really excited about the work and they gave me some of my first editorial jobs. I did a lot of work for <em>Wired</em> magazine; [former director of photography] Zana Woods gave me some of the greatest assignments, and I also understood that it was a really great way to get out into a different part of the world to continue working on my work. If the assignment was two days, I could make it four and work on my things once their things were done. That stuff was crucial because those were like mini fellowships. And then really it wasn’t until 2006 that I started selling some prints here and there, and of course that made a huge difference too.</p>
<p><strong>PDN: What have you learned in your decade working on this project that you would pass onto other photographers?</strong></p>
<p>BU: One of my great mentors and friends Dawoud Bey would say to us early on as grad students, “You have to remember that what you’re conceivably doing here is signing up for life to do this thing.” Which was wonderful advice. Terrifying advice, but wonderful. It asks you to take a lot of responsibility, but it also gave you the idea that this doesn't all have to happen tomorrow or even next week. What you’re doing is committing to something and committing to it so much that you’re willing to see it through no matter how long it seems.</p>
<p>The other thing that’s been really great about doing a long-term project is that it’s not necessarily a success or failure to have one thing happen or another thing happen, or to have one great picture and then have a bunch of bad pictures. The whole thing becomes a process. You pay a lot of attention to the work and it really takes you places. Crawling through the ceiling of a dead mall is not something I expected to have happen. But the idea has become so powerful and interesting and important to me that it’s really important to listen to that and pay attention to that. Those things are really what it’s all about. The career things and the successes are wonderful, and they’re the result of a lot of people’s efforts and hard work, but ultimately there is no other luxury like being able to stand in a parking lot somewhere in the world and wait for the light to do the right things. Nobody else has that job. And then you talk to people who don’t have that job and they tell you about their job and you realize, “Wow, this is really quite [a] profound thing that I’m able to do.”</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        When <a href="http://jorgbadura.com/" target="_blank">Jorg Badura</a> planned to capture a recent New York City Marathon, he’d hoped to shoot finish-line portraits just after the runners completed the race, with the agony and ecstasy of the long-distance achievement still pouring from their faces. With such a massive event, however, that plan turned out to be logistically impossible.<br />
        <br />
        Instead, Badura opted to shoot motion only of the marathon, pulling stills from the footage later on. But he never gave up on the idea of capturing post-race photo portraits. He knew that he’d need to come with a different event for his concept. So Badura turned his attention to the <a href="http://www.seasurfer.org/" target="_blank">SEA Paddle NYC race</a>, where stand-up paddle boarders compete in a 26.5-mile marathon paddle around Manhattan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
        <p>After an initial success with shooting SEA Paddle NYC portraits, Badura’s idea grew into a multimedia personal project that has included stills and animated and motion footage of various aspects of the race. We asked Badura about this project and how he’s able to transport his mobile studio over land and water.</p>
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>:&nbsp; How far did you have to travel to set this shoot up? &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Jorg Badura:</strong> My studio space is on 25th Street in Manhattan so South Street Seaport, where the race is based, is not that far. Depending on the year, we packed it in several cars, used a small truck or simply cabbed it.<br />
        <p></p>
        The logistics were challenging, since I would start shooting the event around 6 AM at the start, jump on a boat or Jet Ski, and follow the entire event around Manhattan’s northern end. Then I’d shoot the leader paddling until just after the Williamsburg Bridge, and then hustle to get off the water to shoot him and everyone else arriving at the finish line.<br />
        <br />
        The key has been to have a reliable group of assistants to set up the backdrop and lighting. The most important thing is to be ready when the first finisher gets out of the water. Model releases are labor intensive. On one side, you want to be able to use the images freely and on the other you want to be able to share the images with the people you photographed. With an event of over 150 participants, obviously you pick certain people to shoot, but the challenge is to track them and keep them lined up. <br />
        <br />
        Other challenges, while shooting, are to communicate what’s happening, how and why, and to answer questions and concerns while still keeping the spontaneous vibe and the realness of the moment. It got easier after the third time. People recognize you and tell others, since they know what’s going on, that they can trust the photographer.<br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: Explain how you were able to create this mobile studio environment to photograph the paddle boarders. Did you have to make an unexpected adaptation or modification once you were on site?<br />
        <br />
        JB: </strong>Each year there have been new surprises, but I tend to handle my personal projects, at times, like full-on produced shoots. Sometimes I have a producer help, but other times an assistant or intern will be in charge. Or I simply do it all myself.<br />
        <br />
        So for each of these SEA Paddle NYC shoots, I did a walk-through at the sites, kind of location scouting the start, finish, even the boats, if needed, like a tech scout. It helps reduce the gear you think you need. The goal is to shoot as much as possible and spend as little time as possible setting up and breaking down, to be able to change on the spot and adjust.<br />
        <br />
        The finish line for those early years was on a tiny little beach (in fact the only natural beach I know Manhattan to have) right underneath the Brooklyn Bridge, so you have this amazing shadow of the bridge creating a constant light. There is the sea wall rising up out from the beach. So all we really had to do from 2011 on was tie a 12 x 12-foot butterfly to the metal fence and, with a little light enhancement, we had perfect conditions. Keeping a 12 x 12-foot butterfly from flying off can be considered a challenge. Kind of easy under the bridge, but a bit more technically involved on the flat barge. Roping skills come in handy. Safety is first.<br />
        <br />
        For some projects, I enjoy backdrops, since they calm the image down, focus your attention, support bringing out the personalities. And for this project I wanted the viewer to get the participant in one glimpse.<br />
        <br />
        I wanted to do it right and I was fortunate to throw some money at this project. I could afford a crew of five consisting of assistants, interns and PAs. One assistant would be with me on the boat around Manhattan for the whole event, the other assistant would lead the other crew to set up the backdrop and lighting upon instructions and an earlier meeting. I wanted to keep sand in the shots to show a beach.<br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: Describe what it was like to photograph portraits of athletes just as they finished the event.<br />
        <br />
        JB: </strong>Very real. It is intimate. You are standing in front of someone whose entire body is pumped on adrenaline. They are in a different zone. You have to be careful, while being fast.<br />
        <br />
        You know they are done, they can hardly stand, exhausted. It feels like you can look inside of them, take an image of the real, true person, all masks are off. Something that touches us viewers deep inside becomes visible, something we can all connect with. I try to go with them into that zone to connect. They guide me to the best shot.<br />
        <br />
        We live in a world of manipulated, controlled and enhanced beauty. We forget or perhaps have never seen the real, true beauty of a person, no matter what their bodies are like.<br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: What gear did you bring and why?<br />
        <br />
        JB:</strong> When I first shot it in 2010, I was still very much in love with shooting film (for certain projects I still am), so I had my Pentax 67s, as well as the then brand-new <a href="http://www.s.leica-camera.com/en/System/LEICA-S2" target="_blank">Leica S2</a> (a loaner) with a 70mm lens, and the <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/eos_slr_camera_systems/eos_digital_slr_cameras/eos_1ds_mark_iii" target="_blank">Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III</a> and <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/eos_slr_camera_systems/eos_digital_slr_cameras/eos_5d_mark_ii" target="_blank">EOS 5D Mark II</a>. It was very ambitious, but we only shot 15 or 20 people due to the very difficult logistics. We had <a href="http://www.brieselichttechnik.de/en/homepage.html" target="_blank">Briese HMI lights</a> to enhance the natural light and plenty of solid floppies. <br />
        <br />
        The other years I choose the Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III, since it can handle a spray of saltwater from the river, and two Canon EOS 5D Mark II bodies, one for stills and one for motion, along with a 50mm f/1.2 lens, a 16-35mm lens, and 24-70mm or 24-105mm zoom lenses for the stills. I also used a 50mm f/1.2 for the motion with a shotgun mic for audio. There was a Kobalt 800W for the light pop on a 2K generator.<br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: What was the biggest challenge you faced and how did you resolve it?<br />
        </strong>
        <p><strong>JB:</strong> The biggest challenge is feeling out the rhythm of the event. There is tons going on and you want to be able to see what happens while shooting, to see your next shot. I kind of get in a groove, a sort of flow, a dance, a timing that places steps for me. Don’t let anybody or anything disrupt your rhythm, no matter what the assault. Focus on the shots to get. Keep the groove flowing, shoot what happens. Drink enough water and don’t forget to eat! And, oh yeah, suck up any bathroom urge …</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <a href="http://www.tomschierlitz.com/" target="_blank">Tom Schierlitz</a>’s 4,000-square-foot studio and workspace in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan includes roughly 1,200 square feet of shooting space, which he often divides into smaller work areas, and a kitchen that a food stylist has told him is one of the best food studio kitchens in New York City. “It’s a pretty nice space,” Schierlitz says. <br />
        <br />
        He moved into a large portion of the space ten years ago when he was making a transition in his work. “I came from a studio where I’d been for about 15 years. There, we had a full-color darkroom, we processed our own film, we made our own prints.” After he began shooting with digital medium-format backs, he says, “I needed a completely different setup.” During renovations, he installed space for three workstations for viewing and retouching images. He also had new wiring and plumbing installed, new floors and custom built-ins added. &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        The shooting space can often accommodate two sets. Schierlitz, who shoots products and still lifes, explains, “Fashion stylists take sometimes an hour or two to do what they have to do. So we’d have two stylists and just go from one set to another.”<br />
        <br />
        That also means he has two sets of all his equipment: Two sets of Leaf backs and two sets of lenses, two Hasselblad systems and all the lenses, all the Profoto lighting gear he needs as well as some Broncolor lighting gear, “which we use for high-speed photography.”<br />
        <br />
        When clients like <em>The New York Times Magazine</em> began asking him to shoot food, he had to rent a studio with a kitchen. Then five years ago, his next-door neighbor moved out, so Schierlitz bought the space and went through another long renovation to install a kitchen. He had its massive stove placed away from the walls, so he can easily move lights around it. <br />
        <br />
        Schierlitz has been calculating whether owning the space is still a wise business model. “My expenses go up every year,” he says, “and the magazines come back and say they want to pay less and less each year.” But, he notes, he still thinks the intimacy and efficiency of the space he’s created help him produce better work. And after renovating every inch to his specifications, “I still come in here and I like it.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        For <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tomrobertsonphoto.com/">Tom Robertson</a>, landing a social media assignment from The North Face to photograph two ultra-marathoners attempting a record-breaking run was the easy part. Delivering the pictures was another story.<br />
        <br />
        “I knew I would have to be in pretty good shape,” says Robertson, who got almost no sleep over three days as he leapfrogged the runners for 210 miles along a remote trail through California’s Sierra Nevada mountain range.<br />
        <br />
        Robertson got the assignment through his acquaintance with runner <a target="_blank" href="http://neverstopexploring.com/athletes/mike-wolfe/">Mike Wolfe</a>, who is sponsored by The North Face. The company sponsors athletes on extreme expeditions to test and promote their products. Wolfe and <a target="_blank" href="http://halkoerner.com/">Hal Koerner</a>, another runner sponsored by The North Face, were proposing to break the speed record for running the John Muir Trail.<br />
        <br />
        “I told them that if The North Face wanted it documented, I really wanted to do it,” Robertson recounts. “I wanted to get a foot in that North Face door, and this seemed like a good opportunity to get that.”<br />
        <br />
        When The North Face decided to sponsor the run, they agreed to send Robertson along to take pictures for social media and for their image library. “They told me they wanted it documented so it felt like you were there with the runners,” Robertson explains.<br />
        <br />
        As an adventure-sports photographer, Robertson keeps himself in good physical shape. But Wolfe and Koerner are in another league of physical prowess, and Robertson would be saddled with cameras and lenses along the trail. He knew he couldn’t keep up the entire distance, so his plan was to meet the runners at strategic points along the way, and help deliver food and water, in addition to shooting photographs. It was logistically difficult because the trail is remote, with few access roads. Robertson would do a lot of hiking to and from the trail at different points.<br />
        <br />
        “It was challenging to figure out where you needed permits” for access and camping, Robertson says. “I had to know the area well, and make sure I didn’t miss [Wolfe and Koerner] on the trail.”<br />
        <br />
        He spent five days on preproduction planning and scouting. Koerner put him in touch with another runner who knew the area. “He showed me all the access points, and helped me figure out what would work in terms of timing” the rendezvous with Wolfe and Koerner, Robertson explains.<br />
        <br />
        The hike began on August 1 at the summit of Mount Whitney. Robertson accompanied the runners on the 12-mile trek up the mountain, shot some photographs of them at the summit, “then I hiked down as fast I could, drove two hours down the road to the next trail head.”<br />
        <br />
        After uploading some images to Instagram, he hiked from 8 PM until 4 AM to get to his next meeting point with the runners. It was an 11-mile hike over a 12,000-foot pass, and he used a headlamp to find his way in the dark. “I was pretty beat,” says Robertson, explaining that he drank a lot of coffee, and stayed well hydrated, to keep himself going.<br />
        <br />
        He got two hours of sleep before Wolfe and Koerner arrived. While they rested for half an hour, the photographer made them a hot meal and some coffee. “I was shooting them at the same time,” he says.<br />
        <br />
        When they resumed the run, Robertson accompanied them for about a mile up the trail to shoot more pictures. Then he retraced his steps, broke camp and hiked the 11 miles back to his car. “That was probably my lowest point,” he recounts.<br />
        <br />
        Robertson uploaded some more pictures to Instagram, then drove further up the road to another trail access point near Mammoth Mountain. That time, he was able to drive to within a mile of the John Muir Trail, where he once again awaited the arrival of Wolfe and Koerner.<br />
        <br />
        “I documented them coming in. They were in rough shape,” Robertson says. He took pictures of them as members of the support team washed their feet, and fed them burgers and milkshakes. They slept for two hours, and by 11 PM that night, they were back on the trail, running in the dark, using headlamps to consult their maps and find their way.<br />
        <br />
        The North Face wanted pictures of them running at night, so Robertson ran down the trail with them for about three miles. Robertson cranked up the ISO on his camera to shoot and relied on whatever light he could get from his own headlamp as well as the runners’ lights. “Headlamps gave it a whole different feel,” he says. “There were a lot of trails going a lot of different ways, so they kept stopping to look at maps, lighting each other and the maps” with the lamps.<br />
        <br />
        Robertson says he was exhausted, and operating on instinct at that point. “I was just trying to get [all the images] I could,” he says. He’d thought about what images he wanted before the run started. “I didn’t have a shot list written out, but I kind of had it in my head.<br />
        <br />
        “The one shot I couldn’t miss was of Wolfe and Koerner coming into the finish line.” He drove with the support team to meet the runners at the end of their run in Yosemite National Park. Having already scouted the finish line and figured out how he wanted to photograph it, Robertson accompanied Wolfe and Koerner on the last three miles of their run, capturing the exhaustion and elation.<br />
        <br />
        “As fatigued as I was at the end, if I could have done it again, I could have run that last 20 miles with them, and I could have got a lot of epic shots with El Capitan in the background,” Robertson says. “That was the thing, looking back, that I wish I could have changed a little bit.”<br />
        <br />
        Robertson’s fee worked out to about $650 per day, plus expenses, which is a modest sum for the time and energy he invested. But he’s optimistic about getting more work from The North Face. “They were really happy with what I was able to do.” He’s also been able to sell the story to some magazines, including <em>Backpacker</em>, and he’s using it for self-promotion. “I’m confident other work will come of it,” he says.<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        When Lisa Shin began looking for a new studio two years ago, she and her agent put a lot of thought and energy into creating a space clients would want to visit. “We wanted it to feel like a destination. It makes us more competitive with other photographers,” the New York-based still-life photographer explains. “Of course, the photography is the most important thing, but the reality is, there’s so much competition.” Clients can choose to work with photographers who will deliver both great imagery and a pleasant working experience, Shin says, “from beginning to end, from the phone calls to the sitting in the studio to the catering to the retouching.” After two years, she’s still planning more upgrades to her studio. “It’s not finished the way a lot of rental studios are, but I get a lot of compliments on it.”<br />
        <br />
        The conveniences begin before clients enter the studio. Located in Manhattan’s SoHo neighborhood, “we are surrounded by every kind of hotel,” Shin says. “We have tons of food options.” The building, which is occupied primarily by small businesses, offers a pleasant lobby and a full-time superintendent. “I feel well taken care of,” she says. <br />
        <br />
        Natural light pours into her roughly 1,200-square-foot space through a large skylight. “It pretty much lights the studio all day so I don’t need other lights on,” says Shin. “Most of my clients enjoy working under the skylight. It’s cozy enough they want to stay all day.”<br />
        <br />
        A media company leased the space previously. After Shin signed the lease, her first step was to knock down walls and tear out the built-in cubicles. She also had a kitchen installed – a first for the building. “I wanted my kitchen to feel like a chem lab,” she says, explaining the high tech fixtures she selected, which contrast with the pickled oak of the cabinets seems incomplete to me as worded.&nbsp; For an <a href="/How-I-Got-That-Shot-9744.shtml">assignment for H&auml;agen Dazs</a> that Shin did last year, she and her food stylist had to bring in ten refrigerators to keep each ice cream flavor at its optimal temperature. The weekend before the shoot, Shin called in an electrician to upgrade the power and install a new electrical box. Shin, who has used HMI lights to shoot video, notes, “A lot of the new lighting doesn’t require as much power but it’s nice to know that I‘ll never have to worry about it.” <br />
        <br />
        Lots of props and merchandise move through her studio. “To keep my place clean and presentable, I have to constantly clean house,” she says. Her lighting equipment, props and scrims get stowed on shelves when she’s not shooting or prepping for a shoot. Typically, however, there are lots of computers, lights and set ups occupying the shooting space, which Shin estimates is about 600 to 800 square feet. Clients expect that, Shin says. “There’s equipment everywhere but I think it helps the energy when they see photo sets up,” she says. “I think that clients are happy to be on the set finally after all the paperwork and the preproduction.” To let them watch the action, she has a computer on the conference table.. “We have it on iShare so clients can watch everything as we go along. It really helps the whole process and the energy. It says: You’re part of this process.”<br />
        <br />
        Shin has a six-year lease, and plans to continue renovating, adding more storage and, in the kitchen, an island with seating. Because she had moved from a larger studio where the rent was higher,&nbsp; she felt the cost of customizing the space was justified. “I like working with contractors and crew,” says Shin, whose father and brother are architects, “I guess because I want to make sure I get what I want, and the only way to do that is to be involved.” <br />
        <br />
        Fellow food and still-life photographers often ask her why she has to lease a space of her own, rather than renting for shoots. Having her own space allows her to keep shoots set up for days in case she wants to reshoot something, she says. “I don’t see it as being a functional business model for me to store my equipment,” which includes custom-made scrims. Not having to rent all her lights and modifiers, or space for reshoots, saves money for her clients, and that becomes a selling point. Clients she says, “find me when looking for a photographer in New York with a studio.” &nbsp;<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        When Brooklyn, New York-based photographer <a href="http://lisaelmaleh.com/" target="_blank">Lisa Elmaleh</a> travels in pursuit of her ongoing projects, her Toyota truck functions as her darkroom and living space. Elmaleh, who uses the wet-plate collodion process to make tintypes and images from glass negatives, has driven the truck, following the Appalachian Mountains, through Virginia, West Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee, and taken it on repeated trips through the Florida Everglades. <br />
        <br />
        “What’s so great is not just that I have all my equipment with me wherever I’m going, but I can go wherever the heck I want to, including pretty far off the beaten track,” says Elmaleh. &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Having saved for many years, she was able to buy the truck in 2011 after <em><a href="/Client-Meeting-Harp-6651.shtml">Harper’s Magazine</a></em> published some tintypes she made in the Everglades. She and a friend built a bed with storage underneath into the back of the truck. “It’s a small platform bed on a series of shelves that are sized to hold my unwashed plates and various boxes of chemistry.” When she’s processing her plates or tintypes, she uses as her darkroom “a cardboard box with a big, black fabric enclosure that wraps around me.” <br />
        <br />
        Before she bought the truck (which she named Harriet, after her grandmother), Elmaleh traveled to the locations she wanted to photograph by car, and pitched a tent to sleep in each night. “But that proved to be a little bit annoying, because I’d wake up, I’d cook my breakfast on my little camp stove, and then I’d have to break down my entire camp and put it in the car and by the time I was out on the road, the sun was already pretty high in the sky,” she recalls. Now that she lives out of the truck, she says, she can remain in a location and be ready to shoot from sunrise to dusk. “You have a different relationship to a place when you can wake up in that place and work there all day,” she says.<br />
        <br />
        She’s fond of the truck’s distinct smell and shade of “sun-faded red,” and says that because she often ventures “an hour to an hour-and-a-half from town,” she values the truck’s four-wheel drive. It “helps a lot if I want to get off the main road or if I get stuck in the mud.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        Jody Dole's studio next to his house in Chester, Connecticut reflects his success as a commercial photographer in New York City during the 1990s and his fascination with vintage darkroom processes. A modern post-and-beam barn with 4,500 square feet of space, the studio includes drive-in shooting bays, a commercial prep kitchen, a rare book library and conference room, a printing suite, a wet-plate darkroom, a guest suite, and plenty of storage space.
        <p>"It went way overboard," says Dole, who'd rather not say how much he spent to build it. "There are so many details in this place that only an obsessed still-life photographer would have dreamed of doing." The windows, skylights and bay doors bathe the studio in natural light. The floors are polished concrete, so equipment rolls smoothly. A high speed fiber optic network is built into the floors and beams. The electrical system delivers 400 amps, with separate circuits for the computers so the studio lighting doesn't interfere.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fifteen years ago, Dole had been planning to buy just a weekend house, with no intention of leaving New York. The 9/11 attacks, not far from his studio, changed everything. That day, he says, "I bought the [Connecticut] house on the phone because I was scared shitless."</p>
        <p>He had to renovate, so Dole didn't move his family to Connecticut until 2002. The change was a shock, he says. "I was used to museums, restaurants, car service, ad agencies, design firms," and sophisticated, demanding clients, he says. His new location, about 90 minutes' drive from New York, had almost none of that.</p>
        <p>Dole began re-building his business as a generalist, shooting for a variety of local and regional clients. He originally put his studio in a 1,400 square-foot addition the previous owner had built onto the house. But that made life in the house too hectic. Besides, Dole wanted more space to accommodate his extensive collections of photography books and magazine, antiques (including a car), and other things. So he had the 4,500-square-foot building constructed on his property.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"I've always been a pack rat," he says, explaining that his new studio has a 900-square foot storage room, with shelves 14 feet high, packed with boxes of objects he's saved over the years, thinking they might become part of a photo project someday.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dole also needed more space for photo gear. "I'm equipped to a fault," he says, adding that in semi-rural Connecticut, "It's not easy to call in a rental." In addition to a full complement of HMI lights and strobes, Dole shoots with a Nikon D800E, and medium format with digital camera backs, including a P45+ Phase One back. "I also have two of everything, in case anything goes wrong."</p>
        <p>He does his own printing in a suite equipped with an Epson Stylus Pro 9900 printer. And then there's the wet-plate darkroom. Nine years ago, Dole befriended Matt Isenberg, a neighbor who owned a world-class collection of 19th century photographs and cameras. Before Isenberg sold the collection in 2012 (for $15 million), Dole spent a lot of time photographing bits and pieces of it.</p>
        <p>"When I got close to it, that made me want to try [wet plate photography]," he says. "My son and I took a workshop, got wooden cameras, brass lenses, and started shooting pretty much everything in tintype that wasn't commercial work. Then I showed my clients, and they started asking for it." (Sam Dole, his son, also uses the studio and teaches wet-plate workshops in New York City.)</p>
        <p>When Dole built his studio, he took on the role of general contractor. It was a distraction that left little time for shooting and self-promotion, he says. His foray into wet plate photography and other personal projects also diverted attention from his commercial business, but on the flip side, those project have rejuvenated him creatively. Now it's time, Dole says, to start re-building his business.</p>
        <p>The new studio, he explains, "isn't about all the stuff we put in it to make it look good. It's about me being able to take pictures that I feel really strongly about that also we can sell to earn a living in order to pay for all this stuff."</p>

        <em><a href="http://www.pacemacgill.com/biography.php?artist=Emmet%20Gowin" target="_blank">Emmet Gowin</a> has been making photographs of remarkable grace, beauty and mystery for more than 40 years. In a <a href="http://www.aperture.org/shop/books/emmet-gowin-books-2817" target="_blank">new retrospective co-published by Fundaci&oacute;n MAPFRE and Aperture Foundation</a>, Gowin elaborates on his work, and on the importance of a photographer’s intuition, patience, chance and personal engagement. The following excerpts from the book are taken from an artist’s statement that Gowin wrote for his master’s thesis in 1967, and from a lecture he gave on the occasion of his retirement from teaching at Princeton University in 2009.</em><br />
        <br />
        <strong>May 1967</strong><br />
        My age now is 25 and I have been photographing for almost six years. From the beginning I wanted to make pictures so potent that I would not need to say anything about them.<br />
        <br />
        … The pictures are made as a part of living and are not the result of any project or assignment. Most of the pictures were made with a 4 x 5-inch camera on a tripod. In this situation, both the sitter and the photographer look at each other and what they both see is part of the picture.<br />
        <br />
        Before 1965 I had been involved with taking pictures of the momentary—what Henri Cartier-Bresson called the “Decisive Moment.” After taking pictures this way for almost four years, taking pictures with a static camera, of people who knew that they were being photographed, was for me an important change in my interests. More the unique qualities of photography interest me, particularly the mystery in an extremely sharp and detailed image.<br />
        <br />
        The photographs of Eug&egrave;ne Atget, Walker Evans and particularly Harry Callahan have influenced me. I accept and embrace this tradition of photography.<br />
        <br />
        Yet always I want to make my own pictures and to follow my intuition.<br />
        <br />
        I do not feel that I can make pictures impersonally, but that I am affected by and involved with the situations which lead to, or beyond, the making of the pictures.<br />
        <br />
        Often my photographs resemble home snapshots. Many of the people in my pictures are my family or my wife’s family or their friends and I make many pictures of my wife. But I always hope to make a picture that is more than a family record. I feel that my clearest pictures were at first strange to me—as D. H. Lawrence said, “Even an artist knows that his work was never in his mind.” I feel that whatever picture an artist makes it is in part a picture of himself.<br />
        <br />
        Kisses are among the vehicles I would use if I were not able to make pictures.<br />
        <br />
        For me, pictures provide a means of holding, intensely, a moment of communication between one human and another.<br />
        <strong><br />
        2009</strong><br />
        I began teaching in Dayton, Ohio, in 1967. Within a week or so of arriving in Ohio we received a postcard from [photographer] Gene Meatyard: “I hear you did a good thesis. Please send it to me in Lexington, Kentucky, and I’ll make an exhibition at my eyeglasses shop.” And I knew enough about Meatyard to say yes. I think Meatyard is one of a few American artists that could fill a pitcher with light. [Editor’s note: The photo Gowin is referring to can be found at <a href="http://www.uky.edu/ArtMuseum/photography/i/arch_1982_10_005a.html" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1bUifPx</a>.] It’s just miraculous. And the whole of his life is a shining beacon. This is miraculous work … <br />
        <br />
        This is, perhaps, my first real image, and there’s a little story to go with it [“<a href="http://www.jacksonfineart.com/Emmet-Gowin-5131.html" target="_blank">Nancy, Danville, Virginia, 1965</a>”]. I’d received my induction papers to go to Vietnam in 1965 … So I packed up my stuff to drive back home to Virginia to argue with the draft board. But before I left I borrowed a view camera from the school … Of course, I was going home to save my life. I wasn’t going home to make pictures … But I got home, and that next evening I made some pictures of a cousin I’d never met. My little niece watched all of this very longingly … That night she crawled up into my lap [and said], “ … Tomorrow, I’m going to think of some really interesting things and you’re going to take a lot of pictures of me.”<br />
        <br />
        I offer this story in this spirit. When a moment of change comes into your life, you can be in a terrible mood and make a great picture. And you can be in the best mood in the world and still make bad pictures. It has to do with something else. [Photographer] Frederick Sommer says, “When feeling is lucid, structure is art.” There’s something deeper than your intentions towards the picture. What you produce in the picture has to be understood in its own terms, and it has to be understood after the fact, because it has nothing to do with intention.<br />
        <br />
        These pictures, from 1965 onward, in some way reflect a thought game … [that] began with a thought about how I would love to see more of the world. I would love to travel deeply and widely. And what is the deepest and widest you can travel? It’s to come back to where you already are. And I saw my own circumnavigation of the Earth, in my mind’s eye, and I realized in that moment that nothing would be more dear to me than where I already was. And, in fact, to anyone else on Earth, where I was—Danville, Virginia—was already as strange and as mysterious as though one of us had arrived in New Guinea. This comforted me in powerful ways.  It gave me a sense of patience, which, in a majestic way, Callahan had reinforced for me very early on … [He said,] “Steichen came to me one year to see my new work, and I had to say, ‘I’m sorry, Edward, but I’ve worked hard for a year and yet I only have one new picture.’ Steichen looked at it and said, ‘I think this was worth it. This was worth a year.’” I am always reminded of this story because of this picture from the next year, 1968.  I thought I got nothing that summer. Three months; not much. Until I found this picture. And I said, “OK, that’s what Callahan was talking about.” [See photo at <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=46774" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/IDhJZI</a>.]<br />
        <br />
        … What always interests me is the story behind [pictures]. It’s the going to, as Diane Arbus said. The going to places, the going and stepping into mysteries that you don’t understand. Sommer says, “Art is the sensuous apprehension of what we do not yet understand, in the presence of nature.” Or in the presence of reality; I think he would use the words “nature” and “reality” interchangeably here.<br />
        <br />
        … In the summer of 1972, Edith’s grandmother had died, followed in the fall by the death of two of our favorite uncles. And in some profound ways my idea of the “local picture,” or of an intimate picture, of pictures at home, changed beyond repair. Here was a natural end to that. [A] picture, [of a] snow-covered landscape, was made from the treehouse that the children built. I think about what [theoretical physicist] Werner Heisenberg says: “When all is said and done, reality is stronger than our wishes.” And Frederick Sommer says almost the same thing: “Only chance is fair.” Thinking that you know what’s required, what you need, is such a facetious idea. What the children had made, what’s there already, what’s there by chance, is so much greater. I would never have made this picture without the children …<br />
        <br />
        [Philosopher Arthur] Schopenhauer wrote a great essay about the appearance of an intention in a life. He says that when you get to a certain age and look back you see all the things which structured your life that happened truly by chance—which could never have been controlled in any way—and yet from hindsight they look like the chapters in your story. “Who wrote this story?” he asks. And my feeling is in accord with what Sommer would tell you: “It’s what you do every day and in the simplest way that counts. The important thing is quality of attention span and to use that for acceptance rather than for negation.” That’s a totally different mindset, and it’s the mindset that turns the corners and opens doors and opens your eyes. I wanted to begin tonight by quoting from the Gospel of Thomas: “Know what is within your sight and what is hidden from you will be revealed.”<br />
        <br />
        … What we find, we ourselves never knew—it came as a shock, it came as a surprise. It was new. We could never have known what we were going to do before it happened. In that sense, we discover.<br />
        <br />
        … And, finally, this is what I need to say to you. There are things in your life that only you will see, stories that only you will hear. If you don’t tell them or write them down, if you don’t make the picture, these things will not be seen, these things will not be heard.<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        At <a href="http://riverimaging.com/wp-riverimaging/" target="_blank">River Imaging Studio</a> in Cincinnati, five photographers and one digital media company operate independent businesses under one roof, while taking advantage of the creative and business perks of a partnership.<br />
        <br />
        “It’s a difficult animal to explain,” says photographer <a href="http://langphoto.net/" target="_blank">Al Lang</a>, who owns the 12,000-square-foot building. He leases space to photographers <a href="http://www.cutiphoto.com/" target="_blank">Bob Cuti</a>, <a href="http://hooverphoto.net/" target="_blank">Randy Hoover</a>, <a href="http://www.keelingphoto.com/default.php" target="_blank">Jon Keeling</a> and <a href="http://www.lawrencewhitephotography.com/" target="_blank">Lawrence White</a>, and the 3-D illustration and animation company <a href="http://www.alloyfx.com/" target="_blank">Alloy FX</a>, which is co-owned by Marc Phelps and Jeff Meyers.<br />
        <br />
        “I’m not a partner kind of guy,” Lang explains. “So I wondered: What kind of business model could I create that allows individuals to have creative freedom, and stand on their own, but still share space?”<br />
        <br />
        The question came up around 2005, after a big client decided to take its photography in-house. “I had too many eggs in one basket,” says Lang, who could no longer maintain the space on his own.<br />
        <br />
        He decided to bring in other photographers, but he “didn’t want it to look like I hired a bunch of kids out of college to shoot. That business model was out there: big guy, supervising other photographers.” Instead he invited in other Cincinnati photographers “with outstanding reputations [to] make the statement that this is something different.”<br />
        <br />
        Lang was offering them better space at lower cost than they already had in their stand-alone studios, without loss of control of their businesses. They had to bring their equipment, do their own marketing and cover their own expenses—except for utilities, parking, Internet access, the alarm service, and a few ancillaries such as coffee and cleaning supplies. <br />
        <br />
        They’ve ended up sharing cameras, lenses and props on an informal basis. And they share the studio’s five shooting bays. “You choose the studio that best fits your needs, and you sign up for it when you get a job, not when you bid on a job,” Lang says, citing a rule that he enforces when he needs to. <br />
        <br />
        An advantage of the shared space, besides the cost savings, is the constant bustle. “As soon as I walked in, I loved it. It was bohemian, cool and it gave you a feeling of energy. It was the first studio in Cincinnati that reminded me of home,” says Bob Cuti, a native New Yorker who joined River Imaging Studio five years ago. “It feels great walking in, and my clients feel the same way.”<br />
        <br />
        Leases are renewable each year, with the option on both sides to terminate with six months’ notice. Currently, there is room for one more photographer. “If anyone approaches me about joining, we decide as a unit whether the person is a good fit for River Imaging,” Lang says. <br />
        <br />
        One challenge for the photographers is keeping professional jealousy in check. There is some direct competition among them, and dry spells can be trying when colleagues are busy. There are also occasional conflicts over the studio reservation schedule, “but no fist fights,” Lang says. “You have to be a big boy or big girl to be in here.”<br />
        <br />
        But the advantages far outweigh the challenges. The atmosphere is always collegial, according to Cuti. Says Lang, “It’s wonderful coming into work. There’s a tremendous amount of positive energy.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        Amy Salzman is a veteran senior integrated art producer with over 20 years of art production experience. She began her career as an art buyer at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising, and then moved on to McCann Worldgroup. She is currently freelancing at both major ad agencies and boutique ad agencies. She talks to<em> PDN</em> about finding and selecting photographers, what the bidding process is all about and how shooting the right tests can help photographers compete for global ad assignments. <br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: When you’re looking to hire photographers for campaigns, what do you consider?<br />
        Amy Salzman:</strong> It’s based on their style, and how much their work matches the comp and the idea that’s been tested. If it’s a car campaign showing a car on a highway with glamorous people, it has to be a photographer who can shoot cars with a sense of glamour and a sense of fashion. &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        In the pharmaceutical world, pharma [companies] test their ads with focus groups and the FDA [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] has to approve the ads, so you have to find someone whose style is very, very close to the ad that’s been tested. And they have to be on budget.<br />
        <br />
        If someone is really being considered for a job, I ask their availability first. Lessons learned: If my shoot is in New York and they’re shooting in Japan the day before, they might think they’re available for my shoot but I’d question that.<br />
        If they’re available and they’re right for the job, then it’s time for the creative call with the creative team. Those calls are very important.<br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: What do you think photographers should ask or say during creative calls? <br />
        AS:</strong> I am looking for them to add some vision. We’re presenting you with creative and we know what we need to accomplish; the photographers should be adding what their vision is for accomplishing it.<br />
        <br />
        Some photographers don’t say anything; you tend to wonder why not. Are they not prepared? Do they not have any ideas? Did their rep not give them a layout? Did they shoot somewhere the night before and they just woke up? Are they in the car and they can’t converse? It’s often not a good thing. <br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: After a creative call, it’s time for a triple bid?<br />
        AS:</strong> First there’s an internal conversation among the creatives: Whose opinion did you like? Who didn’t have an opinion? Then it’s time for a bid, which is a good process. <br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: Why? <br />
        AS:</strong>You may think you can pre-judge a budget, but when you get three bids and they’re all around, say, $150,000 to $160,000, then you can more easily say to the client: This is what this production demands. <br />
        <p></p>
        <p>If you get one bid that’s low ball, you wonder: Are they cheapening certain things to get the job?&nbsp; If two bids come in at $150,000 and one comes in at $250,000, you wonder if they’re overdoing it. </p>
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: So it’s not always the lowest bid that gets the job?<br />
        AS: </strong>That’s true. <br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: Why not? It seems that photographers and reps don’t believe that’s true. <br />
        AS:</strong> It depends on what the difference is between the high, middle and low bids. It also depends on which photographer you think is best for the job. Do low bids tend to look better?&nbsp; Absolutely. But do they always get the job? Not necessarily. On a recent pro bono job, for example, all three photographers came in within $7,000 of each other. Then it was just a matter of client choice about the photographer they wanted to work with.<br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: Do you ever go back to a low bidder and say: Look, there’s no way this can work?<br />
        AS:</strong> I’m not going to tell a photographer how to produce the job but if there’s someone we really want to work with, but they’re way out of the range, I’ll say, “We really want to work with you, but you’re way out of the range,” and let them re-try.<br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you typically find photographers?<br />
        AS:</strong> When I first started, [it was] promo pieces. We had offices with doors. I used to put promos on the wall with the photographers’ and reps’ phone numbers on them. Art directors could come in and look at all kinds of photography, and pull cards off my wall. Now direct mail is expensive, and everyone works in open spaces with no walls. I can’t emphasize enough the importance of a good, simple website.<br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you know which photographers’ websites you want to look at?<br />
        AS:</strong> I try to go to portfolio reviews. I also go on-set and find out who the first assistant is. Some assistants are photographers trying to make extra money assisting, some are learning by assisting and some of them are ready to make the leap to doing a production of their own. It’s the art buyer’s responsibility to learn those things. <br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: Can you share an experience of matching a photographer to a campaign?<br />
        AS: </strong>When I worked at Draftfcb, I helped choose the photographer to shoot the campaign for Oreo’s one-hundredth anniversary. I wasn’t really looking for a food photographer, because it was just cookies and milk, but it was iconic, so I needed someone who creates iconic still lifes and is here in New York City. Someone I’d worked with before was <a href="http://www.richardpiercephoto.com/" target="_blank">Richard Pierce</a>. He can shoot still lifes, he can shoot props and he can shoot liquids. Also he works fast, and we had 17 print ads to shoot. We looked at food photographers and tabletop photographers, but he was the right photographer for the campaign. Just as <a href="http://martinschoeller.com/" target="_blank">Martin Schoeller</a> was the right photographer for the Al Jazeera America campaign [produced by the ad agency Maude].<br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: So you require triple bids, but it sounds like sometimes you have a favorite in mind for the job. <br />
        AS:</strong> Sometimes. But just because a photographer might be my favorite, after the art buyer starts the process of sending links, the [selection] then goes to an associate creative director or a senior art director, who has to present it to a creative director, who then has to present it to an executive creative director and then it has to go to the client. There are a lot of things along the way that can change. So though you have to depend on your art buyer to be out there and bring in [photographers], there are a lot of levels to get through before someone is awarded a job. But when you have three photographers bid, you have to be prepared to go with any one of the three.<br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: What are the advantages and disadvantages of working as a freelancer?<br />
        AS: </strong>The advantages are you can pick and choose where you want to work and the kind of projects you want to work on, and usually you don’t get involved in office politics. A disadvantage is that you always feel like a freelancer, you don’t feel like a member of staff. <br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: When you’re brought in to work on a job, how do you learn about the client, their brand and what they need?<br />
        AS:</strong> I try to get involved from the beginning. That’s harder when you’re freelance. You’re usually brought in at the last minute. But the more you know about the brand, and the more the account team shares with you, the more easily you can pick the right photographer. <br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: Do photographers need to educate themselves about brands in the same way?<br />
        AS:</strong> I think for photographers it’s about delivering the assets. A photographer who shoots cars because he loves cars doesn’t need to know all about the different car companies. What matters is that he delivers great car photography that’s on message. <br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: What do you wish photographers understood better about advertising?<br />
        AS: </strong>The people I’ve worked with understand the job. They understand that if you want to shoot advertising, you have to be able to take direction. I do look at tearsheets for that reason. I like to know which photographers have done work for clients. <br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: Is it difficult for photographers to break into advertising if they’ve only shot editorial work?<br />
        AS: </strong>I don’t think so. Editorial allows photographers to build their books and their imagery. Photographers also shouldn’t be afraid to test. And to test with diverse talent. This is a diverse world we live in. We need to see books with diverse talent in them. Everyone should be shooting for global clients and photographers are not putting diverse people in their books, including age-diverse talent. Baby boomers are the biggest generation and they have the money, but not enough photographers want to shoot older people. <br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: Do you have any other advice for photographers?<br />
        AS:</strong> Keep shooting. Read magazines. Look at other images, look at other websites and look at who your competition is. And if you don’t know who your competition is, research that. If you want to shoot the next Kraft macaroni and cheese ad you should know who’s shooting it now. Do your research. <br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        If you’re wondering where the inspiration for <a href="http://www.adrienbroom.com/" target="_blank">Adrien Broom</a>’s whimsical photography comes from, you can count her studio as one of the sources. It’s located in the old Erector Set toy factory in New Haven, Connecticut, which was converted into artist studios in the 1970s. “Most of the people on my floor are painters or sculptors, and most people’s doors are usually open,” Broom explains. “Being in this space really seems to feed and encourage the  creative mind.”<br />
        <br />
        Broom has partitioned her 900-square-foot studio into separate areas that include a living room, kitchen, storage, wardrobe and workspace. She notes that organization is key, given the elaborate sets that her images require. “With some of the larger sets I build there is always a lot of … stuff … that goes into them, and finding a place to store everything is extremely important. I try to keep each section as a separate space and purpose,” Broom says.<br />
        <br />
        Occasionally, she actually builds the sets within in her studio, as she has done for “The Color Project,” an ongoing series where each “room” featured in the series is dominated by a single color. The studio’s open layout is a perfect fit for her work because it allows her to transform the space easily. “I have painted the floors over at least ten times, and the walls a few times as well,” she notes. Having six-foot tall windows along the largest wall of the shooting space also contributes to the “look and feel” of her work, she says, adding that the “huge, old-school, industrial windows let in amazing amounts of beautiful natural light.”<br />
        <br />
        She supplements that light with an array of equipment that she stores at the studio, including the hot lights and <a href="http://www.k5600.com/" target="_blank">K5600 Jokers</a> that she’s been working with lately. “I also have a ton of <a href="http://www.chimeralighting.com/" target="_blank">Chimeras</a> that I’m constantly swapping out for one another to find the perfect combo with natural light, if I’m shooting during the day.”<br />
        <br />
        Depending on what Broom is currently working on, her daily routine can vary greatly. However, she says her to-do list items usually fall into three distinct categories: building, shooting or editing. “For me, [the studio] is a second home and a place for all parts of the job—brainstorming, building, shooting, editing and celebrating,” Broom explains. “My sets take a while to build,” usually between one and three weeks, she says, “and renting a space per project just wouldn’t make sense.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        When <a href="http://kwakualston.com/home/" target="_blank">Kwaku Alston</a> moved from New York City to Los Angeles 13 years ago and bought a building in Venice Beach, “everyone thought I was crazy,” he laughs. But buying property is “the smartest thing I ever did, and I recommend that [to all photographers],” he says. “If you’re making a little cash, buy some property.”<br />
        <br />
        When Alston purchased his two-story, Spanish modern, live-work space on Abbot Kinney Boulevard, now considered one of the hottest blocks anywhere, the area was “gang-infested,” he recalls. People told him, “Your career is going to go to hell.”<br />
        <br />
        But there were other artists living in the area. “When I moved to Abbot Kinney, no joke, there were ten photographers on my block,” Alston recalls. He could walk down the street and have lunch and talk shop with legendary architectural photographer Martin Rand, and all of the artists “had a great fellowship,” he says.<br />
        <br />
        Alston bought the building from a painter, Enrique Martinez Celaya, who also designed the space. The big selling point was the light. “The light was like 5.6/125 all day long, in one big 2,000-square-foot room [on the second floor],” he says. “It was beautiful.”<br />
        <br />
        In the 13 years Alston has been there, the portion of the building he uses for his studio has grown and contracted, and the building’s adaptability has been valuable as the market—and neighborhood—has changed. <br />
        <p></p>
        <p>At one time Alston maintained a full-service studio, with a full-time staff of four. Celebrities and their handlers liked coming to his space because they could park easily on the street, and they could be relatively anonymous. Then a paparazzi agency moved in nearby and figured out that he had famous subjects coming in and out. “I had paparazzi outside,” he recalls. “So it killed my studio vibe, and I ended up remodeling my studio and turning [the former studio space] into a high-end [residential] rental.”</p>
        The downsizing wasn’t such a bad thing, he says. Maintaining a big studio is expensive, and puts pressure on you to work constantly. “After a while you get to a point where you’re managing so many people, you’re not photographing the things you want to photograph.”<br />
        <br />
        Now Alston keeps a 600-square-foot hybrid office/pop-up gallery/shooting space in part of the building, but uses it exclusively for personal work (he lives in another part of the building, and rents out the second floor). It’s important, he explains, to have a space where he can “work out my creative concepts … That is why I have a studio, and that’s why I will always have a studio. Maybe it won’t always be as big or as small, but I know I have to have a creative workspace, just to flesh out ideas, or [to keep] things I’m collecting.”<br />
        <br />
        The essentials for his workspace, he says, are a good work table, an “inspiration wall” where he can hang photographs and other things he finds, and the ever-present photographer’s dilemma: storage. He also always keeps his 8 x 10 camera around.<br />
        <br />
        A new husband and father, Alston is starting to consider moving off of Abbot Kinney and either selling his building or renting it out. All the artists and the “creative inspiration” are gone, and the neighborhood has become corporate. “I think it’s time for me to leave and go to another space that I can recreate.”<br />

        <em>This article is adapted from the ten-part series, “How to Bring a Cinematic Look to a Small Budget Commercial,” by cinematographer <a href="http://www.ryanewalters.com/Blog/blog.php">Ryan E. Walters</a>. It was first published on <a href="http://www.zacuto.com">Zacuto.com</a>, which offers numerous tips and tricks as well as other great information for filmmakers.</em><br />
        <br />
        As part of my series "How to Bring a Cinematic Look to a Small Budget Commercial," I shared the behind-the-scenes process of how we at the production company Bleeding Thorn Films make a project happen, warts and all, from script to screen. <br />
        <br />
        During the pre-production process, one of the most valuable steps is creating a storyboard. <br />
        <br />
        Before I begin storyboarding, I will either create a formal shot list, or I will have a rough idea in my head of the shots I need to tell the story. Then when I visit the location, with the script in hand, I will begin the storyboarding process.<br />
        <br />
        My preference is to location scout prior to storyboarding. I put scouting first because, as a visually oriented person, I will come up with ideas and compositions based on what the location provides. When I put storyboarding first, I come up with ideas that are impractical at the location, or I try to force an idea to work when there is a more compelling option provided by the location. <br />
        <br />
        There are key questions I ask, or otherwise find the answer to, while I am location scouting that relate to sound, lighting and planning the shots: <br />
        • - Is the location in a flight path, construction area or highway? (These are all sound-related issues.)<br />
        • - Are there any other sound issues I hear? (Maybe the neighbor has a  dog that never quits barking.)<br />
        • - What is parking like? &nbsp;<br />
        • - How easy is it to access the location? (Will it be difficult to bring gear in and out, etc?)<br />
        • - How is the location orientated in relation to the path of the sun? (This will affect the lighting.)<br />
        • - Where are the windows, how big are they and do they have blinds?<br />
        • - What kind of power is available at the location?<br />
        • - Where is the circuit breaker, what are the amps of each circuit and how are they distributed?<br />
        • - Is there a dryer outlet that I can access?<br />
        • - Can I rearrange the room? Is it visually appealing to begin with?<br />
        • - How big is the location? (This  will inform the equipment choices  I make.)<br />
        • - What is the layout of the location? (I’ll take photos to document this.)<br />
        • - Are there any special issues with the location? (Is there a dog that will get in the way, is it filled with expensive antiques, etc?)<br />
        • - Are there any time parameters I need to be aware of? (Like automatically locking doors,  or alarms.)<br />
        • - What are the light levels like, and what kind of practicals are there? Can I swap out the bulbs in the practicals?<br />
        <br />
        During my scouting trip I take notes on my iPhone or iPad, and I take as many reference photos as possible. Two apps that come in handy during the scouting process are Sun Seeker and Photosynth. I use Sun Seeker to map the position of the sun at the location. The Photosynth app allows me to make a 360-degree picture map of a location so that I can view it again later. This is extremely helpful after I’ve left a location and I’m trying to remember the placement of specific items.<br />
        <strong><br />
        Storyboarding App</strong><br />
        I begin making a storyboard using the iPhone app Artemis Director’s Viewfinder. I have found this app to be invaluable in the storyboarding process, as it allows me to actually see what angles I can get at a location. By placing the phone in the environment I’m shooting in, I can tell if it will be physically possible to fit the camera in that space and get the lens and camera movement I need. With each saved reference frame in Artemis, I can note as much metadata as I want. <br />
        <br />
        When I first began using this app, I would enter in everything. But over time, I have found that this slows down my creative process. Now I don’t bother with it, and instead focus on trying different framing choices and camera movements. If I feel a dolly or jib move is needed, I’ll take multiple pictures throughout the move of the camera. If you are having trouble knowing where to begin, start with the basics—the wide shot, medium and close up. Then think about any detail shots you might need to cover the action.<br />
        <br />
        As I am storyboarding the script, I am not running around taking thousands of pictures. Instead, I am constantly thinking about the script and how the placement, movement and framing all affect how the story is told. What I decide to leave out is as important as what I decide to leave in every frame.<br />
        <strong><br />
        Mapping the Story, the Shots</strong><br />
        When I feel that I have captured enough storyboard images at the location to properly tell the story, I’ll gather my things and head back to the office to create a formal storyboard. By the time I’m in front of my computer at the office, I have usually come up with some other ideas or changes I want to make. And having the freedom of not having a client looking over my shoulder allows me the opportunity to play around with the order of shots, as well as with the framing (by adjusting it in Photoshop, if needed).<br />
        <br />
        When I’m happy with the storyboard, I’ll make it into a formal document that I can share with the client as well as with my crew. The amount of detail I put in each storyboard varies depending on the client, the needs of the shot, as well as how much information I need to jog my memory about what is important about that shot.<br />
        <br />
        As I review the shots in the storyboard, I am also paying attention to the set design. Just because I am shooting in a practical location, it doesn’t mean that I have to use everything at the location. My goal is to use only things that enhance the story, add anything that might be missing and take away anything that is distracting. For example, in one location I scouted for a commercial there is a bookshelf that has its back to the desk and is covered with a white sheet. The white sheet draws attention to itself, so that has to go. But even then, the back of a bookshelf doesn’t look appealing, so I’ll have the bookshelf turned around prior to the shoot. That should add some additional texture to the frame. A white chair on the side of the frame also needs to go, as it doesn’t fit the esthetic of the rest of the scene. Finally, the desk and top of the bookshelf will need to be cleaned up. I don’t want a perfectly organized desk and bookshelf, but my photos show there are too many objects that take away from the look I am after.<br />
        <br />
        Now that I know what I need to shoot in order to tell the story and I know what the location has to offer, it is time to move into the next phase of pre-production: creating the lighting diagram, then the shooting schedule and call sheet. <br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[<div>Finding ways to engage new collectors and give artists the freedom and funding to create new work is no easy task. But art subscription services, which deliver new work to subscribers on a prearranged schedule, are popping up all over the country to do just that. They are a win-win for artists and collectors alike, and photography seems to be a perfect match for this platform, because photographers can easily produce multiples of their work for subscribers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Andy Sturdevant, the director of Minnesota-based <a href="http://springboardforthearts.org/">Springboard for the Arts</a> and project coordinator for their CSA (Community Supported Art) initiative, says their program was inspired by a desire to provide an entry point to art for people who may be interested in collecting but felt intimidated by the process. “It was a way to put local artists directly in contact with people who were interested in getting their feet wet with collecting art,” Sturdevant says. These subscription programs are inspired by agricultural share programs (also called CSAs – Community Supported Agriculture), where shares of a local farm are purchased in exchange for regular deliveries of produce.  </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>While similarly structured art programs already existed, Springboard’s program was the first to use the term CSA. They have since created a replication kit to encourage other organizations to adopt the CSA model, and to date there are approximately 30 in existence around the country, according to Sturdevant.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In a typical Community Supported Art program, fifty shares are available for purchase for around $300 per share (Sturdevant has seen the range go from $75 to $500, and the number of shares available can also vary). Artists are paid in advance to create work for each shareholder, and shareholders receive several original works per year. On average, organizations run one or two CSA cycles per year and include nine artists in each.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How artists are compensated for their work depends on the economic setup of the subscription program. For a CSA, the commission paid to each artist depends on the number of shares offered for sale, the per-share price, and the number of participating artists. Some programs retain some of the revenue from shares for administration fees, and others use the CSA as a fundraiser for their organization.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But there are benefits to artists beyond a paycheck. For one, it puts the artist directly in touch with people who are interested in buying art, creating an opportunity for relationship building. Sturdevant feels this format allows artists to try out a new project or smaller idea that may not fit into their regular practice. Subscription services also give artists incentive and support to work. “I think artists… have to work so hard to make ends meet that it leaves very little time for studio practice,” says Chandi Kelley, co-founder and artist-member of <a href="http://www.projectdispatch.biz/">Project Dispatch</a>, an art subscription program based in Washington, D. C. that allows subscribers to select an artist and opt to receive monthly works for either three-, six-, or nine-month periods. Subscriptions are available for $30, $60 or $90 monthly. “If I can do something to encourage the process of art making while helping artists gain exposure and sell work, then I feel my efforts are worthwhile,” Kelley says.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><a href="http://tripplaar.com/">Kristoffer Tripplaar</a>, who is part of the Project Dispatch roster, is a news photographer by day and says the subscriptions encourage him to spend time creating art. “It is motivating to keep working on your personal work knowing you will be sending an image to someone,” Tripplaar says. “It is validating after a few weeks of working on press conference photos to get an email saying someone subscribed. I can switch gears and be creative and print an image I’m proud of to send to someone who is really interested.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“Knowing that someone has specifically chosen you as an artist they would like to subscribe to is incredibly empowering and motivating,” says <a href="http://www.jeromeskiscim.com/">Jerry Skiscim</a>, another Project Dispatch artist. Skiscim is a Washington, D.C.-based photographer who had been intimidated to try to break into the art world prior to joining Project Dispatch. “Being a part of this group of talented and accomplished artists pushed me way ahead of what I could have done on my own,” Skiscim says.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><a href="http://www.tbwbooks.com/">TBW Books</a> is an independent photography book publishing company that also uses a subscription model. Each year, TBW Books invites four photographers to create a body of work for book publication in that year’s subscription set. Artists are encouraged by TBW to experiment and think in a new way. “These publications are not intended to be full-blown monographs,” says Paul Schiek, founder and publisher. “They are intended to be experimental capsules to allow the artist to go outside their normal practice and try something new.” According to the TBW website, “The books provide an unparalleled glimpse into the thinking processes of who we consider to be four of today's most exciting image-makers.” Beyond the creative output, the entry-point pricing is also appealing (previous subscriptions cost $100, the most-recent is priced at $150), </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A huge part of the draw for subscribers seems to be the element of surprise. “People like the surprise and the mystery of not knowing what will come in the mail.  Maybe it’s not even about collecting art for some people, but the experience of the surprise and supporting the creative process for the artists who are involved,” Kelley says. The idea for Project Dispatch came from her long-distance friendship with Rachel England (Project Dispatch’s other co-creator who no longer runs the program but is still a participating artist). Kelley and England would send each other packages of artwork in the mail, and they loved the excitement of receiving artful surprises in the mail, so they decided to create a model to share this experience on a wider scale.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>“Anticipation is a great motivator,” says Schiek. “With TBW Books’ subscription service, you don’t know what you have paid for, but you trust the publisher and the photographer, and you are willing to put your money on the table and see what comes your way. Consuming photography this way is surprisingly unique because we live in such a screen world, and getting tangible books in the mail is exciting.”</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sturdevant agrees that surprise is important. For their CSA pick-up events, they have begun creating staging areas where shareholders can sit and open their box of art goodies. “Dramatizing that moment has enhanced the enjoyment of the experience,” he says. But he also stresses the importance of getting artists and shareholders in the same room so the artists have an opportunity to talk about the work. “In a lot of ways that’s what people are paying for – not just the art, but the social element of connecting to other people interested in art and having opportunities to meet the artists,” Sturdevant says.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Kelley also notes that the physical shows Project Dispatch produce to give additional exposure to their artists always result in a spike in subscriptions. She feels the opportunities to see the work firsthand and to engage directly with the artists are powerful motivators in attracting subscribers. The exhibitions are another advantage of participating – artists get the opportunity to have gallery shows and meet collectors first-hand, providing a platform to launch their careers. Skiscim just had his first solo show in the same space that his work was exhibited in a Project Dispatch exhibition. “Project Dispatch has allowed me to build an audience for my work, which was the thing I just could not figure out how to do on my own,” Skiscim says.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The reproducibility of photography makes it a natural fit for CSAs. For a CSA where 50 shares are sold, each artist has to create and send 50 unique works to shareholders. Sturdevant says they do not want the final product to suffer because of the volume, so they tend to select artists whose work can easily be scaled (photographers, print-makers) or artists who are used to working in high volume (ceramic artists).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But many of the photographers participating in art subscription programs go beyond shooting an image and creating an edition of fifty single photographs. <a href="http://arecaroe.com/">Areca Roe</a> created stereographic images, sending a Viewmaster and slides to each shareholder. <a href="http://stefaniemotta.com/">Stefanie Motta</a> shot a tarot deck with herself as the model, and every shareholder received a full deck of the tarot cards. <a href="http://genepittman.photoshelter.com/">Gene Pittman</a> and <a href="http://cargocollective.com/rebeccayaker">Rebekah Yaker</a> collaborated to create a photo-based fabric design. Each shareholder received some of the fabric and a sewing pattern. “When I think about some of the projects I have really loved over the years, many of them have been photo-based,” Sturdevant says.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When <a href="http://juliavandenoever.com/">Julia Vandenoever</a>, a Boulder, Colorado-based photographer, found out she had been selected as a participating artist for the 2014 <a href="http://csartcolorado.org/">Community Supported Art Colorado</a> program, she knew she wanted to go beyond creating a single image for shareholders. “I wanted to make work that told the story of the change in the Boulder landscape, and so I have decided to create a small photobook to be able to better convey the entire story,” Vandenoever says. “I really want to take the opportunity to explore another way to exhibit and show my photographs.”</div>]]></article_text>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        A guy and a girl are surprised to run into each other on the street. Over a cup of coffee, the guy asks the girl to stay with him until he has to catch a flight home. She isn’t sure, so he suggests they play roshambo, aka rock-paper-scissors, to decide. He wins: They spend a romantic day and evening together in New York City before she walks him to a taxi. The viewer is left to wonder: Will these lovers see each other again? &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        “<a target="_blank" href="http://www.freepeople.com/roshambo/">Roshambo</a>,” a promotional film for the clothing company Free People, has been shown on Vimeo, YouTube and the Free People website. Its romantic cliffhanger proved so popular, Free People produced two more short films. “Roshambo: Rock” and “Roshambo: Paper-Scissors,” shot with bigger casts in other locations, show what happened after the couple parted and, through flashbacks, how they first met. All three videos star Sheila M&aacute;rquez and actor Christopher Abbott, best known for his role on the TV show <em>Girls</em>. Drawn in by the romance, viewers might not notice that M&aacute;rquez is wearing several cute outfits from Free People.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        “This is why our film stood out. The clothes are not the hero, the story is,” says photographer <a target="_blank" href="http://guyaroch.com/guyaroch.com/G3.html">Guy Aroch</a>, who directed the film while also shooting images for the Free People catalogue. The emotional pull of the films makes them unusual in the fashion world. “I find that in most fashion films the main thing that happens is that the model moves around; I find that so boring,” Aroch says. In “Roshambo,” shot on dark streets and in a borrowed apartment with only available light, the clothes are not always easy to see. And that was fine with the client, Aroch says. “They’re smart enough to know it’s not about the clothes, it’s about the emotional connection.” <br />
        <br />
        For Free People’s first foray into storytelling on film, Aroch and his rep, Kelly Penford of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jedroot.com/photographers/guy-aroch">Jed Root Inc</a>, helped Free People creative director Lauren Cohan gather an experienced crew of about 15 people, including director of photography Carlos Veron, an assistant director and a producer. Sound technicians were supplied by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.themill.com/">The Mill</a>, a production and editing house with an office in New York City that Aroch and Veron had worked with before. <br />
        <br />
        Even with a seasoned crew, Cohan says producing the film and shooting in multiple locations in Brooklyn, New York, proved more complex than Cohan and Assistant Art Director Kara Schmidt had anticipated when they first considered putting a love story on film. If the crew hadn’t been so enthusiastic about getting everything done in such a short time, Cohan says, “we would have needed a week to get done what we did in two and half days.” Says Aroch, “Working with Free People, they don’t have big budgets; everyone is there because they want to be there. Lauren hires people for what they do and respects everyone’s input. That’s how we get the results we get.”<br />
        <br />
        Cohan, who came up with the story of a spontaneous and serendipitous encounter, says she was inspired by her travel experiences. She explains, “When there is an expiration date on an adventure, I think the stakes are raised a bit. The cliffhanger ending is meant to be interpreted by the audience.” Cohan had model M&aacute;rquez in mind for the part of the girl. When Cohan and Aroch met with Abbott to pitch the film, the actor suggested adding a game of roshambo to the story. &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Cohan says in his four years of shooting for Free People ads and catalogues, Aroch has “helped define” the company’s “sexy, beautiful esthetic.” She was confident he could bring her story to life, and knew that he and DP Carlos Veron “have a similar esthetic.” Aroch says Veron primarily used available light because that’s his style, but it also added to the reality of the situation. They shot the film on an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.arri.com/camera/digital_cameras/cameras/camera_details/?product=251&cHash=4d3858908f0a8971c86318d603d7a5dd">ARRI Alexa</a>, because it “deals beautifully with darker, grittier light,” says Aroch.<br />
        <br />
        “My agenda is to make our films relatable,” says Cohan. She notes for example that there was little styling during the shoot. “The plan was not to have Sheila sit in hair and makeup for hours to have her look like she just came from yoga class. It’s aspirational but attainable.”<br />
        <br />
        “Roshambo” had no formal script or storyboard. There was little location scouting: Aroch says they chose places they knew in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. “There were certain things we had to cover: the moment they meet, the taxi moment,” he says, adding, “We were mostly improvising the whole time.” During breaks in the shooting, Aroch would squeeze in time to shoot stills of M&aacute;rquez for the 36-page catalogue. The need to shoot the catalogue determined certain changes of wardrobe, but Aroch’s main focus was on filming the storyline, he says. “We decided that the whole concept for the book is in fact the film, so that took priority.” <br />
        <br />
        M&aacute;rquez had never acted before appearing in “Roshambo.” Aroch insists that the believable performances in the film were the result of good casting. “I’d like to take credit for great directing, but in reality, that’s her personality,” he says. “Also Chris was there for her to riff off of. He had a huge part in terms of creating believability.” <br />
        <br />
        “Roshambo” had been planned as a one-off, but the cliffhanger story generated good press, and demands for more of the story. Cohan and Schmidt brainstormed new story lines and wrote more detailed scripts than Cohan had for “Roshambo.” The new stories would also work with the next season’s line of clothing: The second film, which followed M&aacute;rquez on a trip to Rio de Janeiro, included clothes from the summer line. In the final installment, Abbott goes to Paris where he recalls meeting M&aacute;rquez and following her through the city—wearing autumn clothes.<br />
        <br />
        Ryan McKenna of The Mill edited all three “Roshambo” films. The first one came together easily, Aroch recalls, but his job became more complex as flashbacks and layered voiceover became central in the later two films. “Ryan, the editor, is The Wizard of Oz behind the curtain,” Cohan notes. <br />
        <br />
        Free People recently released a new short film, “<a target="_blank" href="http://blog.freepeople.com/2013/12/free-people-presents-cabin/">The Cabin</a>.” Most of the same crewmembers who collaborated on the “Roshambo” series worked on the new film, but it features new stars. What happens to M&aacute;rquez and Abbott’s characters is left to the imaginations of viewers. But thanks to the attention that “Roshambo” earned, Cohan says, “Free People will definitely continue making episodic films.” <br />
        <br />
        Cohan and Aroch believe more fashion companies will create branded content with narrative storylines in order to hold viewers’ attention. “When people go to a movie, they want to see a story. If there’s no story, there is some kind of expectation that’s not met,” says Aroch. “It’s a dangerous place to tread if you’re a company that’s trying to sell something, because, in some way, you’re turning people off.”<br />

        If the kitchen is considered the heart of a home, then photographer <a target="_blank" href="http://francescotonelli.com/">Francesco Tonelli</a> must be feeling the love: his 3,200-square-foot studio boasts two side-by-side kitchens. He added the second kitchen after he moved into the Union City, New Jersey, living-and-working space a year ago because it allows his team to produce more food for shoots. Plus, it provides extra stove space for lunch. “We always make it a point to sit down to a home-cooked meal to break up the day and recharge our energy,” Tonelli says. “For me, being able to offer my clients and crew good quality meals … helps create an experience that is consistent with the core focus of my photography business, which is food.”<br />
        <br />
        The two kitchens are open, facing out toward a client sitting area. In the same space, separated by V-flats, is a permanent set with a Cambo camera stand and two cameras. Tonelli shoots with either a <a href="/Camera-Review-Canon-6749.shtml">Canon EOS-1D X</a> or <a href="/Camera-Review-Nikon-5947.shtml">Nikon D800E</a> tethered to an iMac computer. The oversize room is lined on three sides with windows that overlook the Hudson River, providing gorgeous views of the West Side of Manhattan. <br />
        <br />
        Since he has a separate living area in the same space as his studio, Tonelli often starts the day before anyone else arrives—which is fine by him, since he feels most productive in the morning. He’s got a private bathroom directly connected to his bedroom, as well as two bathrooms reserved for guests—one for men, and one for women. There is a room designated specifically for client meetings and for use when privacy is needed during phone calls. Tonelli’s retouching room is equipped with three iMacs and “a working storage system based on two Pegasus R6 [units] by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.promise.com/default.aspx?region=en-global&amp;m=72">Promise Technology</a> and backups on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.drobo.com/products/professionals/drobo-5d/">Drobo 5D</a> [units],” he explains.<br />
        <br />
        There are a number of rooms in the back of Tonelli’s studio that are dedicated to storing things like dry ingredients, extra refrigerators and freezers, props, surfaces and photographic equipment, including the <a target="_blank" href="http://profoto.com/int/products/monolights-kits-associated-accessories">Profoto D1 Air</a> monolights and <a target="_blank" href="http://profoto.com/int/products/continuous-lights-heads-ballasts-kits-associated-accessories/protungsten">ProTungsten Air</a> continuous lights he often uses on shoots. Having all of these things on hand is one of the key reasons the photographer likes to have his own studio. Tonelli explains, “My work is very personal and detail oriented. I rely on many tools, equipment and ingredients that are not practical to transport on location. Here I [have] almost anything to troubleshoot any small challenge that a shoot might present.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <em>The first exhibition organized by new Museum of Modern Art Chief Curator of Photography Quentin Bajac opens this weekend in the museum’s Edward Steichen Photography Galleries. “<a href="http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1430">A World of Its Own: Photographic Practices in the Studio</a>,” features 19th century, modern and contemporary photographs made by photographers and by artists who have used photography in their practices. Organized thematically rather than chronologically, the exhibition includes work by Man Ray, Harry Callahan, Irving Penn, Seydou Ke&iuml;ta, Bruce Nauman, Adrian Piper, Lucas Samaras, Julia Margaret Cameron, Cindy Sherman, Walead Beshty, Uta Barth and many others. It also features several film and video pieces.<br />
        </em>
        <p><em>"The exhibition considers the various roles played by the photographer’s studio as an autonomous space," reads the introduction to the show. "Depending on the time period, context, and the individual motivations (commercial, artistic, scientific) and sensibilities of the photographer, the studio may be a stage, a laboratory, or a playground."</em></p>
        <p><em>Last week </em>PDN<em> spoke with the former Centre Pompidou and Muse&eacute; d’Orsay photography curator in his MoMA office. He discussed his decision to spotlight studio photography in his first exhibition at the museum, how current photography trends can be understood by looking at photography at the turn of the 20th century, and his plans for photography at MoMA—including the future of the "physical space of the museum." Bajac’s interview with </em>PDN<em> has been edited.</em></p>
        <p><strong>PDN: Why did you choose to begin your exhibition work at MoMA with a show about studio photography?</strong></p>
        <p>Quentin Bajac: Looking at what was happening, especially in the United States today and in New York, a lot of photographers from a younger generation are interested in studio practices. In the ‘90s there was still that strong current of objective, descriptive documentary photography. I think that today there’s a strong current of experimental photography that is interested in the materiality of the image, that is going back sometimes to analogue processes, to experiments in darkrooms, [that is] interested in advertising and fashion in very different ways.</p>
        <p>I think it’s really interesting to try to explain the past from what’s happening today. I didn’t know if I would be able to tell that story with MoMA’s collection. I discovered by opening the boxes and looking at the collection online that there were great bodies of work that I didn’t know, and that there was also a possibility that you could write another history of photography that was not only about that documentary, descriptive photography that was for a long time associated with MoMA. There are, in the collection, some works that could take you elsewhere, and that could write another history of photography that would be a history [of photography] done indoors and not outdoors…. There’s a very strong tradition of studio photography in the United States, in the 20th century, and I think that tradition is today being reconsidered by a younger generation.</p>
        <p><strong>PDN: What do you think of the current movement of photographers questioning and experimenting with the medium?</strong></p>
        <p>QB: I like to try to explain the present with examples taken from the past. At the end of the 19th century you had the arrival of the Kodak [camera] and the Pictorialist reaction to that, with photographers going back to old processes, to painterly images, insisting on Gum bichromate processes, platinum prints, trying really to distinguish themselves from the amateur crowd using the Kodak. In a way it seems that … that the going back of the younger generation to analogue processes, trying to rediscover the materiality of the object at a time when, through the internet, photography is becoming less and less material… is the same kind of reaction. I think today there are some interesting, in a way, neo-Pictorialist works. But there is also something conservative or nostalgic about the evolution of photography.</p>
        <p><strong>PDN: Do you feel the volume of imagery now being produced has given rise to a greater number of ideas in photography?</strong></p>
        <p>QB: I am not sure, because the greater the amount of images, the more difficult it is to read them. That was a problem that scholars and photographers were facing in the [19]20s and ‘30s. If you look back at some texts written by Siegfried Kracauer or German theoretician [Walter] Benjamin in the ‘20s and ‘30s, they talk about that ocean of new images, that blizzard of images that is due to the arrival of the illustrated press. And they had the feeling that they were not able to read that amount of images. In a way the history of photography keeps repeating itself, just with new techniques. In a way everything was invented in the first 30 years and each generation keeps repeating and expressing new ideas with new tools…. Maybe each generation has that feeling that that new amount of images is going to be difficult to absorb, and yet they do.</p>
        <p><strong>PDN: Is it more difficult for curators and editors to find ideas or movements that will endure, because there are so many images out there that you could potentially focus on?</strong></p>
        <p>QB: The problem of the generation in the [19]60s and ‘70s was that they did not have access to images. There were great bodies of work that were not known. Today we have too much access, and scholars, historians, critics, journalists, could spend days on the Internet. This makes in a way the physical space of the museum even probably more relevant. Also we must probably find new ways that we haven’t found yet of getting connected to what’s happening on the web, maybe trying also to invent a kind of digital museum that would be a complement of the physical museum and that would not be just a website, that would be something really where we could work with the photographers, we could commission work and have some online portfolios, etc.</p>
        <p>Sometimes you have great work online that is not meant to be put on the wall. This is something totally different. What we are more aware of today than we were 15 years ago is that photography is very ubiquitous, that it can take many forms. During the [19]80s and ‘90s it seemed that photographers were wall oriented, thinking of the gallery space and the museum space and producing images that were meant to be framed and seen in that context. I think that a younger generation expresses itself through the internet, though self-published books, and in very different forms, and we museums have to adapt to that.</p>
        <p><strong>PDN: Do you see an important place for photographs that have been produced for commercial or editorial use in your programming here?</strong></p>
        <p>QB: I think that we probably should be more open to popular culture than we are. This is definitely a fact. I think if you have a look at MoMA’s collection, there is a mix of images. If you take, for example, photographers from Man Ray to Avedon to Penn, the frontier and the border between artistic work and vernacular photography is sometimes difficult to establish, and there are some bridges. That has always been the case in the history of photography. If you have a look at our collection, you have what I would call artistic photography, but you have vernacular photography, [by which] I mean fashion photography, advertising photography, also photo reportage, photojournalism. Not to mention amateur photography, which is also a part of the collection. Right from the start, from Beaumont Newhall’s [first] exhibition here, MoMA has had the idea of mixing these diverse types of photography and has collected photography as a whole. Steichen did that in a way, John Szarkowski did that by trying to reunite all these approaches, and I think that we should go on and continue to collect [photography as a whole]. Having said this, we are a museum that is focused on artistic practices. Considering the evolution of photography, maybe there is, today, a gap which is deeper than 60 years ago between artistic practice and vernacular practice, applied photography. But nevertheless, I think we should go on probably trying to be more open to popular culture and sometimes to do some exhibitions that would address some of the issues of photography that are not directly connected to art.</p>
        <p><strong>PDN: To what would you attribute the widening gap between artistic and vernacular photography?</strong></p>
        <p>QB: I think it has to do with the way that, from the 70s, photography has been taught and began to be something academic. Both in the way that photographers were trained, and also in the way that scholars were trained.</p>
        <p><strong>PDN: You mention that during the ‘60s and ‘70s a lot of great photographic work was missed because of access. Is there an inverse problem now, where great photography is lost in the flood of images? Will it be up to scholars and curators 10 or 20 years from now to look back and assess what’s going on now?</strong></p>
        <p>QB: Yes, probably, and that’s something that’s always a little tricky with the museum, because we have to take our time. We don’t have to rush. And yet as you know, the art market urges us to rush and to focus on very young artists. I think we must give the photographers, the artists, a little time. You have to develop. You can do a great series, you can do a few great images, but becoming a real photographer takes a little more time. You have to edit your work, you have to see how it evolves as time goes by. This is always the difficult balance and position to find: stepping back and yet being aware and reactive to what’s happening.</p>
        <p><strong>PDN: Is there a distinction between the ideas that artists who identify as photographers explore in the studio and the ideas that artists who are working with cameras explore?</strong></p>
        <p>QB: I’m not sure there is. Some people that you would call artists really like to call themselves photographers. Someone like Jeff Wall, who is often called an artist, would say “No, I am a photographer and I belong to that history of photography.” The frontiers are sometimes a little blurry. Photographers would maybe start with what’s in front of their camera and then maybe edit their work in a more intellectual way. Whereas the artist using photography thinks and then tries to in a way illustrate—even if that’s not the right word—their thoughts through photography. I think that could be an interesting distinction. But probably having said this I could find many counterexamples [laughs].</p>
        <p><strong>PDN: You mentioned before we began that the best photographs are made from the encounter between an idea or concept and reality, the way the outside world can take a photographer’s idea or concept and change it. How do you see concept being affected by reality in the studio setting where photographers weren’t interacting with the world?</strong></p>
        <p>They were working in the studio, but in a way the studio is the world. It is a physical place, which has its specificities. Some of the most inventive studio photographers played with that enclosed space, using it as a stage, as a set, and in a way recreating a world within a world.</p>
        <p><strong>PDN: What do you hope visitors will take a way from this exhibition?</strong></p>
        <p>QB: I hope they will take away the fact that each photographic image is a construction, that the studio is also about the world, and that photography is about recording and playing with space. You can do that outside of course, but you can do that inside. I also hope that they will understand that photography is a whole, and that artistic practices can have connections with vernacular practices, and these frontiers between portraiture, advertisement photography, artistic photography or scientific photography are really blurry, and artistic photography has always nourished itself from these other practices.</p>
        <p><strong>PDN: You’ve acknowledged in other interviews that the photography curator at MoMA is highly scrutinized by the world of photography. How do you think that more specialized audience will receive the exhibition?</strong></p>
        <p>QB: I hope they will be surprised. I hope they will discover images they didn’t expect to find in MoMA’s collection. I hope they will understand the fact that I am trying to show that there is another way of writing the history of MoMA’s collection. And that focusing on studio photography is not saying I’m not interested in documentary practices</p>
        <p>I hope they will like the way the exhibition is hung, because I did try to have quite a lot of space between the images. I didn’t want to have too many images in each room, so I decided to have fewer images than we used to have in the photo galleries. I hope that they will understand the fact that there are very few texts in the exhibition. In each gallery I chose a two-sentence text that explains the general content of each room, and a quote from one of the photographers included in the show. I really wanted to have the ideas expressed through the images and to make images work together through the way they are displayed.</p>
        <p><strong>PDN: It can be argued that photography is the most dynamic and changing art medium today. Would you agree with that?</strong></p>
        <p>QB: I think I would. I think that we are going through a very interesting period for photography. I was mentioning that shift at the turn of the 19th century and the changes, and I think we are experiencing one of these big changes in photography. It keeps reinventing itself, and through these constant changes of technique manages to always appear as a young art and a young medium. And I’m in a way still amazed that a young generation is so interested in taking photos; that old art, that old medium. One of the French deputies in 1839 at the arrival of the daguerreotype was talking about a new art in an old civilization when talking about photography. And this new art is now 200 years old and it still appears new and challenging, which is great.<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        Picture stories about people fighting cancer are common and often predictable, with an attention to medical procedure and suffering, and a tendency to leave viewers with little more than a “there but for the grace of God” feeling.<br />
        <br />
        But <a href="http://www.nancyborowick.com/" target="_blank">Nancy Borowick</a> takes a different approach in her documentary about her parents, who are struggling with the disease at the same time. Hers isn’t a story about the suffering and dying, but about the relationship of two people sustaining life and love.<br />
        <br />
        “It’s extraordinary work. And one of the things that’s interesting about [it] is [that] there is an intimacy,” says James Estrin, co-editor of <em>The New York Times</em> Lens blog, which <a href="http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/18/side-by-side-battling-cancer-and-sending-off-the-bride/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">posted Borowick’s story in October</a>. “There’s no using people as symbols, there’s not playing up suffering, it’s just well-rounded people that you see.”<br />
        <br />
        Borowick has been photographing her parents for the past year, since her father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in December 2012. Her mother, meanwhile, has had a relapse of breast cancer. <br />
        <br />
        “I just assume people know [that] there is the sadness, there is the anger and death is on our doorstep. But for me that’s not what our experience has been like,” Borowick says. “There’s a lot of joy, happiness and silliness … because we have this awareness of time, there’s no point in spending it sad and depressed. We’re trying to do our best to cope, and enjoy the time left together. I’m trying to capture that.”<br />
        <br />
        Since it was posted on Lens blog, the story has been published in <em>The New York Times</em> Metro section, and in the <em>International New York Times</em>. But Borowick didn’t intend it for publication when she started. She meant only “to have a record of my family, for future generations, and for my memories,” she explains.<br />
        <br />
        Photographing her parents also gave her a way to spend more time with them, and cope with her own anguish. “Shooting like it’s an assignment gives me a bit of an emotional break from what’s happening in front of me. It’s therapeutic for me.”<br />
        <br />
        Borowick had previously documented her mother’s struggle with breast cancer while studying photography at the International Center of Photography in New York City. That project ended when the cancer went into remission. When her father, Howie, was diagnosed with cancer at the end of 2012, “he asked my mother if [she thought] I would be interested in photographing him.<br />
        <br />
        “I think my dad wanted his story told, too,” Borowick surmises. “Maybe it was secretly his way to spend more time with me, but I wanted to spend more time with him.”<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;Her access “is a photojournalist’s dream,” she says. Giving their complete trust, her parents imposed no conditions. Only once has her father expressed annoyance at being photographed. <br />
        <br />
        “It totally shocked me,” Borowick says. “Then I explained that I wanted to document everything: the good, the bad, the ugly, the silly, the happy.”<br />
        <br />
        But the family ties and her parents’ needs pose a challenge. “I do this dance figuring out: Am I a photographer at this moment? Am I a daughter at this moment? Am I a shoulder at this moment? I want to be all of those things at the same time for them.”<br />
        <br />
        She has continued to shoot freelance assignments for <em>Newsday</em> and several other publications, but has put other personal projects on hold to devote as much time as she can to her parents. And she carries her camera at all times when she’s with them. “I’m always taking pictures.”<br />
        <br />
        Borowick shoots with a <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product-Archive/Digital-SLR-Cameras/25444/D700.html" target="_blank">Nikon D700</a>, mostly with a 35mm f/1.4 lens (she also carries an 85mm lens and a 24-70mm zoom lens). She relies on available light. “I shoot a lot in the early morning and late afternoon, which provides me with gorgeous and gentle natural light beaming in through the windows,” she says.<br />
        <br />
        On the two occasions when nurses tried to stop Borowick from taking pictures, her newspaper experience kicked in. “I kept repeating, ‘The oncologist approved it,’ and I kept taking pictures until [a nurse] made me stop,” she says. “I take pictures first and try to figure out [if it’s OK] second.” Her mother also advocated that she be allowed to photograph her parents during medical procedures.<br />
        <br />
        Her emphasis is mostly on her parents’ relationship, and how they live with illness day to day. The signature image of the project shows them taking their weekly chemotherapy treatments together, sitting side-by-side in big chairs with IV drips. Her father broods, while her mother comforts him almost absent-mindedly with her hand and reads a magazine.<br />
        <br />
        In another image that Borowick shot in her parents’ kitchen, her dry-humored father puts on a stony face and breaks into a dance to cheer up her mom. “As you can imagine, the energy has been low around the house,” Borowick says. <br />
        <br />
        That’s evident in the images of her father napping, but Borowick also shows her parents as any devoted middle-aged couple, celebrating Howie’s fifty-eighth birthday at home, for instance, and standing arm-in-arm in a shallow swimming pool while on vacation in Florida. In another image, Borowick’s parents muster the strength to walk her down the aisle at her wedding. (She positioned a camera in a tree for a bird’s-eye view of the ceremony.)<br />
        <br />
        “The wedding was a major distraction for everyone,” says Borowick, who pushed up the wedding date because of her parents’ illnesses.<br />
        <br />
        Part of her process of treating the project like an assignment, even though she didn’t intend to publish it, was showing it to a few photo editors whom she’d met as a student at ICP. Borowick explains that she wanted their opinions “to make sure I wasn’t missing anything.”<br />
        <br />
        Early last summer, she submitted an edit to the My Story competition at the <a href="http://nyph.at/" target="_blank">New York Photo Festival</a>, “to see if anyone cared,” she says. Estrin, who was one of the jurors, called her in July to talk about the possibility of featuring the project on Lens blog.<br />
        <br />
        “I tread carefully with this project,” Borowick says. “I trusted that <em>The New York Times</em> would treat it with the respect that you would want.”<br />
        <br />
        The project drew high praise, and an outpouring of good wishes for Borowick and her family. “I told my parents they’ve given me this amazing gift, sharing this world of theirs with me,” Borowick says. “They responded, ‘You’ve given us this gift, too.’ It’s strange that there can be these silver linings in this crappy situation.”<br />
        <br />
        A week after the Lens blog post, Howie got news that his cancer was back after a brief remission. Borowick continues to photograph her parents, uncertain how much longer they will live, but determined to spend all the time she can with them. <br />
        <br />
        <em>Editor’s note: Howie Borowick died on December 7, 2013, as this story was going to press. His family is asking people to direct donations to the <a href="http://www.lustgarten.org/" target="_blank">Lustgarten Foundation</a> for pancreatic cancer research. “While he loved flowers and would even pull off the road so we could smell lilacs in the neighbor’s yard, he loved life more so we want to find a cure for this awful disease,” Nancy Borowick says.</em><br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        In thinking about <a href="/PDN-January-2014-9719.shtml">the innovations</a> shaping the photography industry today, it’s interesting to consider where yesterday’s innovations have taken the medium. Looking back at what was touted as the “next big thing” a decade ago can temper enthusiasm for today’s supposed “game-changer.” Looking at where we’ve come from can be instructional as well as good fun.<br />
        <br />
        In the Tenth Anniversary Issue of <em>Photo District News</em>, published in February 1990, writer Peter Moore considered the changes in film photography over the previous decade. After lamenting the “color uniformity” in transparency films, Moore noted, “One thing we have gained in abundance is film speed.” Slide films of the day were “remarkably good” at ISO 1600!<br />
        <br />
        Moore also noted that amateur-focused color negative films were displacing pro-focused transparency films in the market. “The vast majority of amateurs have embraced the tolerant, ‘snapshot’ films … Serious SLRs are being set aside for ‘decision-free’ pocket cameras. Ironically, the results are often better than the slides of yesteryear.” Substitute “smartphone cameras” for “pocket cameras.” Sound vaguely familiar? <br />
        <br />
        In the 2004 <em>PDN</em> Photo Annual, writer Jay Mallin celebrated Wi-Fi technology as a major “player” in the photo industry, which seems quaint as we look at reviews of increasingly sophisticated smartphone-camera hybrids. Mallin touted “two new products … that will allow wireless transmission directly from a camera, without even a laptop,” before wondering: “How many photographers want clients and editors to see images direct from their cameras before they’ve had a chance to hit the delete button?”<br />
        <br />
        In that same issue, the release of the Kodak SLR/c, which accepted all Canon EOS lenses, was the big digital camera news.<br />
        <br />
        For our September 2001 issue (which, by the way, featured a Patrick Demarchelier image of an actress with retoucher’s notes—something we can’t imagine a publicist allowing these days), editor David Walker wrote about editorial photographers who were making the switch to digital photography from chromes. “The hard part” for one photographer, Walker wrote, “is convincing editors to let him shoot jobs digitally.” Now we occasionally write about photographers trying to convince editors to allow them to shoot film.<br />
        <br />
        In an article looking at the future of digital cameras from October 2005, which was our 25th Anniversary Issue, writer David Schloss countered the prevailing wisdom that DSLR sensors would not exceed 20 megapixels, and predicted the “megapixel-war” would continue long into the future. In discussing how file storage for digital cameras was affecting technological development, Schloss suggested that readers “look for future cameras to include higher-velocity storage systems.” Pretty good call, but then he continued: “Compact Flash, SD and other cards will be relegated to the dump within a decade.” Could still happen.<br />
        <br />
        Which of the innovations noted in this issue will have truly shaped the industry when we look back at the present decade? History discourages declarative statements, but we’re certain of one thing: the rapid advancement of photographic technology won’t grind to a halt anytime soon.<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <strong>Client: <em>Bolero</em></strong><br />
        <br />
        Photographer <a href="http://www.dianascheunemann.com/" target="_blank">Diana Scheunemann</a> shoots fashion, portraits and beauty, but no matter what the assignment, her signature lighting style is designed to make her subjects’ skin look “nice and fresh and yummy.” Her work for clients like Arena, Bacardi, <em>Elle</em>,<em> GQ</em>, Levi’s, <em>Maxim</em>, <em>Playboy</em>, and <em>Vogue </em>is also recognizable for the sexy and energetic moments it captures. Her techniques for shooting and lighting, she says, allow her to move as her subjects move and shoot fast, before they get bored or restless. She also notes, laughing, “I’m directing them to be spontaneous.” Her husband, who frequently collaborates with Scheunemann to concept her shoots, often reminds her of the time he heard her shout to the models over the loud music playing on the set, “Have fun. Now!” <br />
        <br />
        A recent cover story for <em>Bolero</em> magazine on the model Charlotte Free demonstrates how Scheunemann, who is based in New York City, directs her subjects and plans her technique. <br />
        <br />
        In addition to shooting the cover and inside spreads, Scheunemann also shot a short video for the magazine’s website showing Free dancing, writhing and jumping to music. “She was one of my favorite models because it was easy to shoot her moving, she’s a brilliant dancer as well,” the photographer says. “Because I’m directing the models when shooting stills anyway, the transition [to motion] for me is more natural.” She adds, however, that stills and motion are different disciplines. Though she recently completed a documentary film, <em><a href="http://www.loveamericanskin.com/" target="_blank">Love American Skin</a></em>, based on her road trip around America, she says, “I wouldn’t call myself a filmmaker. I’m foremost a photographer who likes to venture into filmmaking.” <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Logistics:</strong> “It’s a beauty story but we didn’t want to do a typical beauty story,” Scheunemann notes. The goal was “to show her in a really cool environment.” Scheunemann suggested a location she loves, the Metropolitan Building, a 1909 former electrical parts factory in Long Island City, New York. Though it has been refurbished and turned into a venue for weddings and photo shoots, some rooms still have exposed brick walls and weathered wooden floors. &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        “Whenever it’s physically possible I go to the location and see which corners I’m interested to shoot in or else I ask the location manager to send photos.” In a beauty story like this one, the look for the makeup is conceived first, then the wardrobe is selected to suit the makeup and then Scheunemann chooses a part of the location that complements the look. Alice Lane did the makeup, Lacy Redway did the hair and stylist Stephanie Tricola oversaw wardrobe. Says Scheunemann, “I like to have a dialogue and teamwork with everyone on the set, including the model so she knows what I want and I know what she wants to give. I have to know how far she wants to go.”<br />
        <strong><br />
        Lighting: </strong>When she spoke to <em>PDN</em>, Scheunemann had just wrapped a shoot that required five lights coming from several directions, but typically in her fashion work, she prefers working with just one or two lights. She explains, “I think it just looks nice and natural. If there are too many lights, it quickly looks artificial.”<br />
        <br />
        Whether she’s using a beauty dish or an umbrella set on a boom, the light source is usually in front of the model, typically above Scheunemann’s head. It’s a setup that flatters skin and reduces flaw. Often, she says, “I have my assistant handhold the light so when I move he can move with me.” When she shot Free, she used an octabank placed on a stand that could be moved.<br />
        <br />
        The pop of a strobe helps keep up the models’ energy during still shoots, Scheunemann believes. “They don’t need to hold a pose very long. They know when I’ve taken a picture so they move quickly.”<br />
        <br />
        She says she prefers to shoot at ISO 100, and recalls that she took the images of Free at 1/125 of a second at f/11. In between shooting stills for the magazine, she shot video using continuous lights. She didn’t use these for any of the stills, however, because “you couldn’t make it bright enough so that I could shoot it as quickly,” she notes. <br />
        <strong><br />
        Camera:</strong> Scheunemann followed Free’s movements by shooting handheld. “I hardly ever shoot on a tripod,” she says. “I don’t want to always tell them move in this direction or that direction. I want to focus on their expressions rather than on that one centimeter which I can move really easily with a camera.” <br />
        <br />
        She used a Canon EOS-1D X to capture both the stills and the video, and used a zoom. “I like a zoom lens because, for me, it’s very important to [get] a picture really quickly. If she pulls a really cool face, I want to capture her face.” As she moves, the assistant makes sure the light follows, rather than stopping to adjust the light with each movement or adjustment. Says Scheunemann, “I like to make small adjustments with the lens rather than moving the light.” <br />
        <strong><br />
        Post-Production: </strong>Scheunemann regularly works with two retouching houses—one in Poland, one in Switzerland—that know her style and taste. “To me it’s very important that the skin look like human skin,” she says. “It must look clean if it’s a beauty or fashion shot but it shouldn’t look airbrushed.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        Five years ago, a pregnant friend of photographer <a href="http://lexiafrank.com/" target="_blank">Lexia Frank</a>’s asked her to photograph the delivery of her baby. Enthralled by the experience, Frank has documented dozens of births since then for clients, in addition to her work as a portrait and wedding photographer. <br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: What makes birth photography so appealing to you?<br />
        Lexia Frank: </strong>In terms of life-changing events and meaningful moments, it’s an incredible thing to be in a room with someone delivering a child. I still cry at every birth. And when I go through the images later, it’s a wave of emotion all over again. <br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: How do you market your birth photography?<br />
        LF:</strong> I promote it on my <a href="http://lexiafrank.com/" target="_blank">website</a>. I also go around to birth centers and hospitals, and leave marketing materials there, [including] an album of a birth. I get a lot of leads from that. And when people contact me about maternity photography, clearly they’re going to have a baby, so I also give them information about my birth photography. <br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: How often do you photograph births?<br />
        LF: </strong>I want to be at every single birth, so I will book only one per month. Other photographers book more, but they have to arrange for back-up [i.e., second photographers, in case two clients give birth at the same time]. <br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: What preparations do you make, and what is a shoot like?<br />
        LF:</strong> I meet clients informally for tea or coffee to get to know them, and see if it’s a good fit. Then I’ll have a contract meeting, and everyone who is involved is there. That’s a great expectation setter. We talk about lighting, and what I need to produce imagery, and what happens in case of an emergency, or a C-section. Once labor starts, the client will call me, and we stay in communication until they go to the birthing center or hospital. I like to get there before active labor starts, just to talk, say hello and take a couple of shots. <br />
        <p></p>
        <p>Labor can take hours and hours. Clients understand that I’m not going to be there 100 percent of time, capturing every nuance. I get enough to tell the story of the labor and delivery, and I let them have their privacy.</p>
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: Do you have a checklist of images to shoot?<br />
        LF:</strong> I have a mental checklist: the mother during contractions, and not during contractions. Her husband or partner, her family. Maybe they’re holding her hand, or putting wet washcloths on her forehead. I want to capture that support and that love, and of course the major event: if she’s walking around, pacing or in the act of delivering the child. The first moment when the baby is put [on] her chest. The cutting of the umbilical cord, the weighing of the baby, the swaddling, the first family portrait.<br />
        <br />
        I love to think about moments, and wait for them to happen, instead of shooting everything rapid fire and ending up with thousands of images I have to cull through. There’s a lot of time to anticipate what’s going to happen next, and think about interesting angles. <br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: If something goes wrong, do you stop taking pictures?<br />
        LF:</strong> I’m going to document everything that happens, as it happens. If some emergency happens, and they don’t want to see the images, I will happily delete them as if they never existed. But if the mother stands up and faints, I’m going to shoot that, because who knows? Maybe she wants to see that later on.&nbsp; It’s part of the story. If they don’t request that I not take photographs, as a fly on the wall, I will continue to photograph. If it were a life-or-death situation, it’s likely a health professional would be ushering everyone out, and I wouldn’t have the opportunity [to take pictures]. <br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: Why do you use only available light?<br />
        LF:</strong> It changes the mood if I introduce lighting, and it’s disturbing for the people delivering, and flash is not good for a newborn baby’s eyes.<br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: So how do you deal with low-light situations?<br />
        LF:</strong> If it’s daytime, I might be cracking the shades. If it’s nighttime, I might bring a soft lamp close to [the mother]. During the delivery, the midwife or doctor needs some lighting to see what’s going on. So I’m never in a situation where the baby is coming out and there’s no light at all. <br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: What cameras and lenses do you use?<br />
        LF:</strong> My preferred camera is a film camera, a Contax 645. I love to use that with the Ilford 3200 film. If I don’t have enough light for film, I’ll switch to a Nikon D3S, which does great in low light. I’ll use a 50mm f/1.4 and I’ll stick with that the majority of the time. On my Contax I use an 80mm f/2.0 lens.<br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: Why film?<br />
        LF:</strong> That’s what I started with. I think there’s a lot of depth to it, I love film grain, and there’s something timeless about it, and epic. <br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: What else is in your bag?<br />
        LF:</strong> I bring at least three bodies, and back-up lenses. I have a telephoto lens, and a tilt-shift lens I’ve used occasionally. I also have a flash and an LED light, which I have never used but I have them with me just in case. Besides my equipment, and extra batteries and chargers, I bring a survival kit: a blanket, a pillow, a good book and a laptop computer, because there can be some serious down time. And I pack my own food.<br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: What are the biggest challenges of birth photography?<br />
        LF:</strong> Because this is such a new genre, there are a lot of people who are inexperienced in their business practices [and] who aren’t charging enough. Client expectations are part of the issue. They’re used to paying one price for a portrait session, and they ask, “Can you photograph my birth for the same price?” We have to start setting our client expectations on par with wedding photography, rather than portrait photography. <br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: What do you charge? <br />
        LF: </strong>You cannot [survive] as a business for less than $3,000. The issue is you’re four weeks on call, and roughly 24 hours shooting at a birth; $3,000 should be your starting point, and I’m around $5,000.<br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>PDN</em>: What do you deliver in the end?<br />
        LF:</strong> I like to deliver my clients an album, because photographs are best viewed as a series: beginning, middle, end. They also receive image files for up to 8 x 10 prints. If they want to print a 4 x 6 image for Grandma, they can do that. But for anything larger than 8 x 10, they have to go through me. <br />
        <em><br />
        </em><strong><em>PDN</em>: What’s your most important advice for photographers about how to succeed as a birth photographer?<br />
        LF:</strong> Value yourself as a birth photographer. People do this because they love photography and they love births, and unfortunately they’ll shoot for free, or not charge enough and run their business into the ground.<br />

In his opinion, what sets her apart from her peers is her ability to work with both the right and the left sides of her brain. Not only does she do digital tech work, she also handles all aspects on set including lighting, large-format cameras and client relationships. She’s also great at managing the business side of a studio. But if her personal photographs, which are reminiscent of Sally Mann’s “Deep South” series, are any indication, her creative side is what will make her career.</p>

        <p>One sign of true talent is when a photographer can put aside his own ego, and get along with other photographers on a set. It means that he has enough faith in his own skills that he doesn’t need to constantly prove himself. Such is the case with <a href="http://robertkozek.com">Robert Kozek</a>, whom photographer <a href="http://matthewjordansmith.com/">Matthew Jordan Smith</a> says is not only humble, “he’s just one of those incredible assistants who doesn’t let you down.” On his own time, Kozek is in the process of building a thriving business as a portrait shooter. He has an ability to draw out nuanced expressions—melancholy, wryness—from his subjects.</p>

        <p>When <a href="http://www.miekesnepvangers.com/">Mieke Snepvangers</a> isn’t booked to shoot her own weddings, she is the first person <a href="http://www.beccarillo.com/">Becca Rillo</a> goes to when she needs a second camera on a shoot. Having “saved the day” on multiple occasions by taking photos of moments Rillo didn’t have time to capture herself, Snepvangers is always able to snap pick-up shots while Rillo photographs the couple, Rillo says. With a portfolio full of impressive attention to detail, raw emotion and great candid shots, Rillo says Snepvangers’s work speaks for itself. “I was blown away by her from day one,” she says. “I knew I had to have her. She is my rock, and I’m truly convinced that I couldn’t do what I do without her.”&nbsp;</p>

        <p><a href="http://ginamariephoto.com/home.html">Gina Marie Santucci</a> has shot for some of New York City’s busiest working photographers, including <a href="http://www.tonygale.com/">Tony Gale</a>, who says Santucci is “very motivated and has a great attitude.” He also notes that he especially likes her food photography, which is what she works on in her personal time. After studying photography at schools in Boston and Florence, Italy, she moved to New York City and started taking forensic food photography. She treats her subjects, which include oranges, fish and pears dripped in syrup, like cadavers being dissected in a laboratory. The resulting images are deliciously gruesome. Recently, she’s branched out to making more traditional food photographs. Notable for their technical perfection are her close-ups of seafood being plunged into pools of water.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">	</span></p>

        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.raymondmeier.com/">Raymond Meier</a> says <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stephaniedinkel.com/">Stephanie Dinkel</a> was the best assistant he ever had. With most assistants, he’s had to “manage” them, constantly reminding them of important details, but with Dinkel, the opposite was true. She could always be counted on to know everything about the latest technology, whether a client liked their coffee with sugar or without, and when to wrap up early so that Meier could go pick up his son at soccer practice. “This is what I consider a dream assistant,” Meier says. “These details make all the difference.” Today, she still helps him with his more difficult assignments, and as she focuses on her own still-life and portrait photography, Meier assists her, too.<br />

        <br />
        After traveling almost nonstop for two years as the assistant to photographer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.joemcnally.com/blog/">Joe McNally</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bmoorevisuals.com/">Brad Moore</a> was ready to set down some roots. Almost immediately, he was hired to be the assistant of Scott Kelby, a photographer based in Florida. What Kelby values most about Moore is not only that he works hard, but also that he’s a talented photographer in his own right. “He keeps an eye on things in shoots that I might miss,” Kelby explains. Originally from Tennessee, Moore’s true passion lies in concert photography. And it shows—his lush, color-soaked images transmit the euphoria one feels in the presence of music you love. <br />

        Consultant <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sosastone.com/">Amanda Sosa Stone</a> first met <a target="_blank" href="http://meganmillerimages.com/wakeskate">Megan Miller</a> in 2010, when Miller was working with another consultant who introduced her to Stone. From then on, Stone insisted on hiring her. Miller now works as a video assistant for Stone, who describes Miller as “focused, with no ego.” Miller is easy-going and responds to any tech-related need with ease. Stone says Miller gathered and scanned all her original files and coded all of the designs for her new website. “The website would have never been completed unless she was part of the project,” Stone says. “She made it all happen.”<br />

        <strong>Type of Assistant: </strong>Digital Tech &amp; First Assistant<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Location:</strong> Philadelphia<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Best Skills:</strong> Color calibration/color profiling; daylight shooting; digital capture and software; light metering; managing other assistants; photo archiving/image editing/image delivery; post-production software/retouching; still cameras: 35mm, digital backs, large format and medium format; still lighting: continuous/tungsten/HMI/Lowel/Kino Flo and strobes/flash systems<br />
        <strong><br />
        Has Assisted:</strong> Chris Crisman, Ryan Donnell, Dominic Episcopo, Patrik Giardino, Mark Katzman, Sonja Pacho, Dominic Savini, Chris Sembrot and Walter Smith<br />
        <br />
        At first glance, <a target="_blank" href="http://davidohl.com/">David Ohl</a>’s images look more like abstract canvasses or still-life paintings than they do photographs. Frequently using monochrome palettes to make objects pop off the surface of the images, Ohl has a clear talent with conceptual photography. Although he’s adept at handling cameras, what sets him apart from other assistants, according to <a target="_blank" href="http://chrissembrot.com/">Chris Sembrot</a>, is his skill with digital technology. “He knows all of the elements of digital cameras, and is super easy to be around,” Sembrot says. “What more could I ask for?” <br />

        <strong>Type of Assistant:</strong> First Assistant
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Cardiff, California</p>
        <p><strong>Best Skills:</strong> Administrative/studio management; color calibration/color profiling; daylight shooting; digital capture and software; light metering; managing other assistants; photo archiving/image editing/image delivery; post-production software/retouching; still cameras: 35mm, digital backs, large format and medium format; still lighting: strobes/flash systems; website design and management</p>
        <p><strong>Has assisted:</strong> KC Alfred, James Law and Donald Miralle</p>
        <p><a href="http://brandonmagnusphotography.com">Brandon Magnus-Ledesma</a> decided he wanted to work for <a href="http://www.donaldmiralle.com">Donald Miralle</a> when he saw one of Miralle’s photographs in a textbook during his final year at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, so he e-mailed persistently. Eventually the award-winning sports photographer hired Magnus-Ledesma to assist on a 2012 shoot for Golf Digest. They’ve been together ever since. Magnus-Ledesma “knows what he wants, and he won’t stop until he gets it,” says Miralle. The most nervous Miralle’s ever seen Magnus-Ledesma was while they were preparing to shoot the Ironman Competition—Magnus-Ledesma had never done underwater photography. “He got his scuba certification, and learned how to use my underwater gear,” Miralle explains. The hard work paid off: Magnus-Ledesma’s personal underwater shots are worthy of his mentor.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">	</span> </p>

        <p><a href="http://www.andreapattonphotography.com">Andrea Patton</a> moved to New York City seven years ago after graduating from the Hallmark Institute of Photography in Turners Falls, Massachusetts. She believes that she’s been a successful assistant to photographers such as <a href="http://www.tonygale.com/">Tony Gale</a> because she’s hardworking, efficient and a quick problem solver. On her own time, she focuses on her food photography. She doesn’t shoot other people’s food—she shoots what she makes herself after trying new recipes. “My food photography gives the viewer a sensual experience,” she says of the resulting images, which make even a sandwich look like an art form. In the near future, she plans to shoot food full time.</p>

        <p>For portrait and lifestyle photographer <a href="http://www.markmahaney.com">Mark Mahaney</a>, <a href="http://graybrandsted.com">Jeffrey Brandsted</a>&nbsp;is less an assistant than a collaborator. “I want overall competence in an assistant, but most important for me is having someone to bounce ideas off of,” explains Mahaney. Brandsted is that and more for Mahaney, who says that he is “someone who has become a good friend.” Born in the Tornado Alley region of the United States, Brandsted got a degree in journalism at the University of Kansas before moving to New York City to study photography at the School of Visual Arts. In his own time, he shoots the cityscapes he encounters while on the road for work. In doing so, he captures a picture of modern-day America as seen through the eyes of someone who notices small details, sweeping lines and subjects whose very presence speaks volumes about a specific place.<span style="white-space: pre;" class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Has Assisted: </strong>Vincent Fournier</p>
        <p>Photographer <a href="http://www.vincentfournier.co.uk">Vincent Fournier</a> says his work with Irene Lam began unexpectedly in 2010. After his second photographer couldn’t make a shoot, Fournier asked Lam to help out and was impressed with how quickly she picked up settings he gave her on the fly, handling his backup, manual Fujifilm S2 Pro. “She’s now shooting with a [Nikon] D300,” Fournier says, “and even with that camera’s low-light capability, she uses flash to great effect at weddings.” Lam has now struck out on her own in the industry, but Fournier still remembers when she took boudoir shots for a bride and made her feel at ease while working effortlessly with the available light.<span style="white-space: pre;" class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></p>

Bazar joined Propert for a 2.5-month shoot, and she subsequently assisted him on a three-month shoot in Italy as well as another three-month shoot in the Caribbean Islands. “These sound like dream assignments, and they were, but the scheduling and logistics were unbelievable,” Propert says. “Mind-bending travel nights were stacked on top of 14-hour shoots. She stuck it out the entire way with zero complaint, all the while learning and shooting her own impressive portfolio.”<span style="white-space: pre;" class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&nbsp;</p>

        <strong>Type of Assistant:</strong> Digital Tech &amp; First Assistant
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Roznov pod Radhostem, Czech Republic</p>
        <p><strong>Best Skills:</strong> Daylight shooting; digital capture and software; light metering; managing other assistants; photo archiving/image editing/image delivery; post-production software/retouching; still cameras: 35mm, digital backs and medium format; still lighting: continuous/tungsten/HMI/Lowel/Kino Flo and strobes/flash systems; video lighting</p>
        <p><strong>Has Assisted:</strong> Adam Hinton, Alex Howe, John Huet, Jim Naughten, Garry Owens, Mark Seliger, Simon Stock, Anton Watts and Robert Wilson</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.ubaldrutar.com/">Ubald Rutar</a> worked with advertising photographer <a href="http://johnhuet.com/">John Huet</a> on a few commercial projects before joining him to cover the London Olympic Games for a 28-day assignment. Though being a sports photographer at the Games is one of the most grueling jobs out there, working as a photographer’s assistant at the sporting event is even harder, Huet says, but Rutar could not have done a more impressive job. Working on very little sleep, Rutar downloaded, edited and uploaded more than 160,000 photos over the course of the 28 days, all the while with a good attitude and a smile on his face, Huet says. “I have never worked with another assistant who worked so hard and made no mistakes,” he says. “He did such an amazing job that he was the only person I asked if he wanted to work the Winter Olympics in February with me. And thankfully he said yes.”</p>

        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Brooklyn, New York</p>

        <p>As a self-described visual anthropologist, <a href="http://www.laurelgolio.com/">Laurel Golio</a> is enthralled by how people identify and present themselves, how they navigate the world and how they fit into various subcultures. <a href="http://emilianogranado.com/">Emiliano Granado</a> has seen over the past four years of working together that Golio is a “real human” who has “been making significant work. Instead of trying to make work that will get her jobs, she’s been working on a project that changes young people’s lives,” he says. Golio began her “We Are the Youth” project to raise the visibility of queer youth in America. “She’s one of the best people I know,” Granado says.</p>

        and Mike Tittel</p>
        <p>Like many successful people, <a href="http://www.gagethompson.com/index.html">Gage Thompson</a> didn’t wait for work to come to him—he sought it out. Along with taking his own photos of the skateboarding culture in Utah, he’s also a trusted first assistant. When he approached <a href="http://miketittel.com/">Mike Tittel</a>, a lifestyle and sports photographer, about working as his assistant, Thompson sent him not only a resume, but also a time when he would call to follow-up. Tittel was so impressed by Thompson’s professionalism that he hired him. On a recent shoot with Tittel, Thompson took it upon himself to learn a lot of unfamiliar equipment so that he would be ready for every shot. But Thompson is not all work. “We have a lot of fun on set,” Tittel says. “He has a great sense of humor.”<br />

        <p>Sahara Coleman’s love for photography was ignited as a child, and in high school she began experimenting with such alternative processing techniques as lith printing, and Sabattier and solarizing effects. Today, she’s shooting weddings, portraits and working with The House Studios as a freelance production assistant. Coleman hopes to eventually art direct in the commercial world, but she still likes returning to the older ways of taking photos. “Once in a while I take out my Hasselblad 501c and shoot some 120,” Coleman says. “It’s good for the soul.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        Canon’s new Dual Pixel CMOS AF system may be one of the biggest advancements in digital-camera technology we’ve seen in quite a while. Introduced in 2013 with the launch of the <a href="/Camera-Review-Canon-9874.shtml">Canon EOS 70D digital SLR</a>, this innovative autofocus process—which utilizes a unique approach to implement phase-detection AF—is a major development for solving autofocus issues that arise when a dedicated phase-detection sensor is unavailable and the camera is forced to use the slower contrast-detection AF. This occurs in a DSLR’s live view and movie capture mode, when the mirror must be flipped up. <br />
        <br />
        At the same time, Dual Pixel CMOS AF has strong implications for further improvements in mirrorless cameras, which, like live view and movie capture, depend on sensor-based contrast-detection AF. Canon’s Dual Pixel CMOS AF can also be effective when a hybrid autofocus system is used, where a camera dedicates only a limited number of pixels to phase-detection AF to be used in combination with contrast-detection AF.<br />
        <br />
        While hybrid systems have improved autofocus speed, this approach is still lacking, with lenses hunting or pulling in and out of focus before locking on a subject. This occurs because cameras still depend largely on contrast-detection AF. As the name “contrast-detection AF” implies, a certain amount of contrast between adjacent pixels is needed before focus can be achieved, which is particularly difficult in low light. <br />
        <br />
        With its Dual Pixel CMOS AF, Canon takes a unique approach by creating two separate photo diodes for each pixel, covering about 80 percent of the sensor vertically and horizontally. Hiroshi Miyanari, a Canon staff engineer and one of the technology’s developers, explained in a white paper that each set of photo diodes perform both phase difference AF and imaging functions by capturing two parallax images at the same time: “With Dual Pixel CMOS AF, signals from these two images are used to carry out phase-difference detection AF.” In addition, he noted that, “by combining two photo diodes, the image signal can be output as one pixel,” with no negative effect on image quality. Because the two processes are combined, he pointed out, Canon was able to expand the dual functionality to “all pixels” (albeit with 80 percent coverage).<br />
        <br />
        Thanks to its broad coverage of phase detection across the sensor, Dual Pixel CMOS AF is designed to bring faster and more accurate autofocus to DSLRs in live view and smoother autofocus tracking when shooting video. Additionally, the technology promises better performance in low light, since the autofocus is not dependent on the amount of contrast available in a scene.

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        Imagine that one morning, while enjoying your daily latte, you come up with an absolutely brilliant idea for a new camera accessory. So, how do you go from concept to reality? In the past, you would have had to work with a machine shop to create a prototype, then talk to manufacturers about having an injection mold made for your first production run. <br />
        <br />
        What if instead you could sit down at your computer for a few hours of design work, and have the prototype in your hands the very same day? That is the promise of what is known as 3-D printing. With a machine about the size of a 1990s-era laser printer, you can use your computer and basic 3-D modeling software to “print” out items in the same way that you would use a word processing program and a printer to create your neighborhood newsletter. Sounds too good to be true, right? But this technology has already been used to make camera mounts and even a camera.<br />
        <p></p>
        <p>The process of 3-D printing goes something like this: The printer takes a material, often ABS plastic filament, and melts it. Then, a tiny movable nozzle squirts out the melted plastic as though it were ink from an inkjet printer. Instead of just laying down a single layer of ink, however, the 3-D printer retraces its steps, laying down layer after layer of material on a platform, building items up one very thin layer at a time. For almost three decades, automobile and airplane manufacturers have used 3-D printing technology for prototyping parts and designs. The printers they used were giant industrial machines with a price tag of around a million dollars. While the use of these machines is still growing across a wide range of industries, the real explosion in 3-D printing has been in small-scale production and manufacturing. </p>
        For around $1,300 you can get a build-it-yourself kit online to make your own 3-D printer or spend $2,200 on a turnkey unit such as the <a href="http://store.makerbot.com/replicator2" target="_blank">Replicator 2</a> from <a href="http://makerbot.com/" target="_blank">MakerBot.com</a>. In the past you would have had to purchase 3-D CAD (computer-aided design) software, such as AutoCAD or SolidWorks, before you could make use of your new printer. These programs are both quite expensive and rather complicated to use. With the advent of free 3-D software such as <a href="http://google-sketchup.en.softonic.com/" target="_blank">Google SketchUp</a>, however, the cost and the learning curve have been greatly reduced. <br />
        <br />
        While it is still a young technology with worlds of evolution ahead of it, 3-D printing has already started to work its way into the photography industry. Sites like <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/" target="_blank">Thingiverse.com</a> provide files you can print to produce everything from basic lens adapters and GoPro mounts, to more complicated creations like a rail system for a digital SLR film rig with motorized focus-zoom ring control. Some exciting and innovative projects have been produced with 3-D printing technology as well. A French student recently designed and printed an entire film SLR camera, the <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printed-Camera-OpenReflex/" target="_blank">OpenReflex</a>. A pinhole camera dubbed the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1506199837/pinhole-printed-a-3d-printed-pinhole-camera" target="_blank">Flyer</a> is another piece of photographic equipment created with 3-D printer technology. The Flyer began as a Kickstarter project, and it was so popular that it reached its goal of $1,200 in ten hours, going on to raise an additional $12,000. <br />
        <br />
        The bottom line is this: 3-D printing is changing the ways in which inventors are able to design, prototype, manufacture and ultimately sell their products. It has also greatly leveled the playing field, allowing smaller companies to more effectively compete in the marketplace. So, the idea that the next great photographic accessory could come from your morning coffee daydream session may not be quite as far-fetched as it seems.<br />

            <article_image_caption><![CDATA[
        In her book, Elisabeth Tonnard paired each of the photographs with one of 90 different translations of the opening lines of Dante’s <em>The Inferno</em>. The translation that accompanies the image on the opposite page reads: “Halfway on the path our life is/I found I was in a dark woods;/For I had lost my direction.” The translation that accompanies the above image reads: “About the middle of life’s onward way,/I found myself within a darksome dell,/Because from the true path I went astray.” Tonnard says she feels as if “each person [in the images] is saying those lines and saying something about their situation in life, and it sounds very unique. But because they are all saying the same thing, it’s not very unique at all.”

        <a target="_blank" href="http://elisabethtonnard.com/">Elisabeth Tonnard</a> describes her book <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.jandlbooks.org/tonnard.html">In This Dark Wood</a></em> as a “modern gothic.” In it, 90 different black-and-white portraits are paired with 90 different English translations of the opening lines of Dante’s <em>The Inferno</em>. “Midway along the journey of our life/I woke to find myself in a dark wood,/for I had wandered off from the straight path,” reads one of the translations, by Mark Musa.<br />
        <br />
        Part of the macabre beauty of <em>In This Dark Wood</em> lies in subtleties like the items clutched and ferried by these would-be lost souls. Crumpled paper bags and hastily wrapped packages abound, as if they are refugees sent into this gray limbo, bearing their last effects in hand. Or the words on an oft-glimpsed movie marquee that swims in the gloomy background of many images. Soon, you begin to notice the words suspended in the air—petrified, terror, hell, doomed—only amplify the dread that builds alongside each translation of Dante’s foreboding introduction. All the while, though we know their way is lost, the subjects set forth grimly, one after the other, alone.<br />
        <br />
        Tonnard sourced all of the images from the <a target="_blank" href="http://vsw.org/joseph-selle-fox-movie-flash-archive.php">Fox Movie Flash</a> collection, a massive archive of mid-twentieth century street photography. Held by the Visual Studies Workshop, a nonprofit photographic arts center in Rochester, New York, the archive consists of millions of negatives donated to the institution by Joseph N. Selle. Selle owned the long-defunct Fox Movie Flash, a company that employed teams of street photographers who prowled downtown San Francisco from the 1940s to the 1960s. Selle and his team made snapshots of tourists and pedestrians in the hopes of selling them the portraits. A high-volume business model meant that they took far more pictures than they ever sold, leaving a vast archive of images that had never been printed or seen.<br />
        <br />
        <em>In This Dark Wood </em>is not, technically, a new book. A prolific self-publisher, Tonnard released the first edition in 2008 and continued printing copies in small batches over the intervening years. In 2012, she and J&amp;L Books publisher Jason Fulford reached an agreement to print a trade edition. Fulford first met Tonnard and saw the self-published edition in 2010, when he was lecturing at the Visual Studies Workshop in Rochester. “The book really surprised me—such a simple concept and understated presentation, but with a result that is very moving and emotional,” Fulford says in an e-mail to<em> PDN</em>.<br />
        <br />
        Working with a publisher has been a new experience for Tonnard, who has more than 30 self-published works. She acknowledges feeling as though she has surrendered some ownership of the work, but the prospect of wider distribution excites her. <br />
        <p></p>
        <p>“I felt like I have reached the audience I can reach with my publications, they have seen this book, they know about it. So this is a good thing. I’ll close the open edition that I had and give somebody else the chance to bring it to a larger audience,” Tonnard explains.</p>
        Tonnard first encountered Selle’s treasure trove during her time in Rochester as an MFA student in 2006. Combing through what was merely a fraction of the negatives, Tonnard lit upon ideas for two different artist’s books. The first became 2007’s <em>Two of Us</em>, a meditation on “the double,” making liberal use of photographs from the archive and a Baudelaire poem. The second idea became <em>In This Dark Wood</em>.<br />
        <br />
        “In that collection of 18,000 scanned images I had, there was one roll of about 1,500 images which was shot completely at night. There was a contrast in that roll, there were more people walking alone than in the daytime rolls. I also noticed that the people looked as if they were in another place; lost in thought, alienated from their surroundings,” Tonnard says. “There were all sorts of people in that book [of images], but they all share this expression on their face.”<br />
        <br />
        Tonnard can no longer remember exactly how she began to associate these images with <em>The Inferno</em>, but recalls having “a very beautiful, very old” copy of the poem in her studio at the time. Her experience working on this book seems to mirror the experience of reading it: she found herself surprised by the synergy the text and photographs developed as the work progressed.<br />
        <br />
        “It’s as if each person [in the images] is saying those lines and saying something about their situation in life, and it sounds very unique. But because they are all saying the same thing, it’s not very unique at all,” Tonnard muses.<br />
        <p></p>
        <p>The conceit seems simple on its face, but each perusal of <em>In This Dark Wood</em> reveals another layer of meaning. The candid night photography is imbued with new pathos from Dante’s poetry, with each solitary pedestrian pressed into service in an epic tragedy. The result is a remarkably malleable work that is both repetitive and ever-changing.</p>

        With more photographers switching between lighting systems as they shoot both video and stills, Drew Strickland created the Lumenator as a way to let photographers use their electronic flash and an LED light at the same time.<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        Videography requires a continuous lighting source rather than the strobes used for still photography. LED (light-emitting diode) lighting has become increasingly popular for video work in recent years due to the advent of affordable high-output LEDs. They are significantly more efficient than their halogen and incandescent forerunners, and give users a longer run time for a given battery size. In addition, LEDs offer a multitude of output colors, meaning that true daylight-balanced fill lighting is easily possible without any filtering. Because of these advantages, LEDs from companies like <a href="http://www.litepanels.com/" target="_blank">Litepanels</a> and <a href="https://www.fotodioxpro.com/" target="_blank">Fotodiox</a> have become commonplace on everything from a wedding photographer’s digital SLR to a broadcast TV on-location rig.<br />
        <br />
        There are, however, drawbacks to using continuous LED lighting for still images. Not the least of them is that it takes a giant LED light panel to equal the lumens output produced by even a very small Speedlight. This leaves many working pros with no choice but to switch back and forth between two lighting systems, both fighting for the single hotshoe on their DSLR. Drew Strickland, <a href="http://colorright.com/colorright_flashright_store/" target="_blank">founder of ColorRight and inventor of the popular FlashRight diffusers</a>, says he wondered to himself: “Why isn’t there one small, simple unit that lets you use your electronic flash with an LED at the same time?” <br />
        <br />
        Strickland set out to develop one. His newest product, the <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/lumenator-groundbreaking-photo-and-video-lights" target="_blank">Lumenator</a>, is a combination flash bounce diffuser and LED light panel. It can attach to any Speedlight flash with Velcro. It is just slightly over half of an inch thick and weighs in at just over one pound, including its battery pack. It uses a patent pending technology that ColorRight is calling LEDNatural, which was designed to provide very diffused light with minimal power loss. The Lumenator can be used as a standard, if slightly bulky, bounce diffuser for electronic flash, but it also offers the ability to light stills or videos with daylight-balanced LED light. The Lumenator has an output of over 3,000 lumens, which is approximately equivalent to the output of a 300-watt bulb. Power options include both a 2,800 mAh battery pack and an AC adapter for studio work. <br />
        <br />
        Having designed and released a number of ColorRight products, Strickland is well versed in the traditional product development and production process. But for the Lumenator, he chose to go in a different direction and use indiegogo, a crowd-funding website. “Crowd funding has been a really cool experience for us because it provides instant feedback on our product offering,” he says. “Thanks to a lot of new technologies, like 3-D printing, we have been able to make improvements and refinements to products on the fly, before we commit to the final design. The participatory element of crowd funding cannot be overlooked. I think involving your customers in designing, and in financing, your dream of a product produces much better results for everyone involved.”<br />
        <br />
        ColorRight has taken advantage of an innovative idea (a lighting option for both photos and video), using a new technology (high output LEDs and new diffusion) and used production methods that were not available even a mere five years ago (3-D printing and crowd funding). Says Strickland, “There seems to be a sense of ownership that takes place when you go the crowd-funding route. I think we owe a lot of our success with the Lumenator campaign to this feeling of ownership and participation.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <em>National Geographic</em> is beloved by photographers because it supports long-form storytelling, often dedicating multiple pages to the photo essays that run in every issue. But the organization is doing more for photographers than just hiring them to produce images for the monthly magazine. <a href="http://www.natgeocreative.com/ngs/" target="_blank">National Geographic Creative</a>, an agency that operates separately from the publication, is pitching the unique skills and expertise of many <em>National Geographic</em> photographers to help them land assignments in the commercial world. <br />
        <br />
        National Geographic Creative has had many iterations over the years. At one time it was simply a photo archive where third parties could license <em>National Geographic</em> imagery. It has since grown to include an agency that represents nearly 60 percent of the photographers who shoot for the various <em>National Geographic</em> publications, and a creative studio that creates custom advertising for <em>National Geographic</em> as well as other brands, including Disney, HSBC Bank, Nokia and Volkswagen.<br />
        <br />
        When pitching its photographers for commercial assignments, National Geographic Creative tries to present “a 360-view of who these photographers are and what they can bring to the table for clients,” explains Alice Keating, vice president of sales and marketing at Nat Geo Creative. Keating and her team see their photographers as more than just people who shoot photos—they are also experts, spokespeople and more.<br />
        <br />
        When commercial clients hire a <em>National Geographic</em> photographer, “we know that [they] expect more than just great pictures,” explains National Geographic Society Senior Vice President Maura Mulvihill. “They expect problem solving, expertise, and an ability to handle all different kinds of personalities and situations.” <br />
        <br />
        An obvious expertise that Nat Geo Creative photographers bring to any assignment is a depth of knowledge about locations around the world. The agency benefits from having a network of over 70 photographers who not only share information about off-the-radar places but also have valuable contacts on the ground, including fixers who can help facilitate a shoot. A recent campaign for HSBC Bank required photos from little-known spots in 27 different locations. The images were captured for the campaign by a team of Nat Geo Creative shooters, including <a href="http://www.jodicobb.com/" target="_blank">Jodi Cobb</a>, <a href="http://talent.natgeocreative.com/talent/annie-griffiths.php" target="_blank">Annie Griffiths</a> and <a href="http://talent.natgeocreative.com/talent/joel-sartore-1.php" target="_blank">Joel Sartore</a>, and used for print ads, online ads, out-of-home displays, on-site promotions and more. JWT New York, HSBC Bank’s ad agency, turned to Nat Geo Creative not only to hire talent but also to produce the campaign. <br />
        <br />
        Another skill that Nat Geo Creative can pitch is the technical know-how its photographers have gained from decades of experience shooting for the magazine. Disney originally reached out to Nat Geo Creative because it needed photographers in specific locations to shoot panoramic views to use as decor on its cruise ships. Three Nat Geo Creative photographers shot the assignment, including <a href="http://talent.natgeocreative.com/talent/stephen-alvarez.php" target="_blank">Stephen Alvarez</a>. Disney reached out to Nat Geo Creative again when it needed iconic, panoramic images of seven major cities across the globe to display on the 72-inch screens that encircle the lounge on its new Disney Fantasy cruise ship. The images needed to be shot in a particular way so they could later be animated by a CGI (computer-generated imagery) team. Disney was so pleased with the shots of Paris that Alvarez made for the initial assignment, that it hired him to shoot all seven cities.<br />
        <br />
        “They were really very technically specific images because things had to stitch into the [screens] the right way,” explains Alvarez. After discussing both the logistics and technical requirements with Disney and its CGI team, Alvarez shot the entire seven-week assignment. <br />
        <br />
        Alvarez says his experience scouting locations and making travel images helped him on the Disney job. “What I think [Disney] enjoyed was that I was ‘fire and forget,’ because they could give me the criteria and then send me out and not have to worry about it because I know how to get on rooftops in cities, I’ve been doing it my entire career,” he says about the assignment. &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Alvarez has been shooting for <em>National Geographic</em> magazine since 1995. He has done a few commercial assignments over the years, but never big, international campaigns until Nat Geo Creative started pitching him for jobs. While the Disney Cruise Line work may seem like a natural fit given his past experience shooting caves, cultures and cityscapes for <em>National Geographic</em>, his partnership with Nokia is a little less on the nose.<br />
        <br />
        Initially, the company wanted Alvarez to shoot the American Southwest using the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/us-en/phones/phone/lumia1020/" target="_blank">Nokia Lumia 1020</a> smartphone for a gatefold ad that would appear in the October issue of <em>National Geographic</em>. But the assignment evolved to include him being the subject of a video about the campaign, which was shot by fellow Nat Geo Creative photographer <a href="http://talent.natgeocreative.com/talent/john-burcham-1.php" target="_blank">John Burcham</a>. <br />
        <br />
        Because Alvarez is interested in technology and has been shooting with cell-phone cameras for years, he also became a Nokia digital imaging brand ambassador (for example, he just returned from speaking at a launch event for the phone in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates). Alvarez explains, “Those things are based all around my ability to not only make photographs but then to talk about the things I’m using and why they’re important,” He adds, “I’m actually really excited about these phones because they do astound me.”<br />
        <br />
        Nat Geo Creative has been able to successfully translate many of its photographers’ passions into paying gigs. For example, when The Richards Group came up with a campaign for its client AVG that involved a tiger, it contacted Nat Geo Creative. “They wanted an authority on tigers and how to deal with tigers, and someone who was familiar with working with them and also able to direct the shoot,” Keating explains. “So they hired <a href="http://talent.natgeocreative.com/talent/steve-winter.php" target="_blank">Steve Winter</a>. He was the perfect candidate for this job: he was a tiger expert, he was an authority in the field and respected in the field, and knew how to work with the animals in a way that was respectful to them.” The resulting online video, which involved an actor being protected from a real tiger by a cage built with toothpicks, has gotten over four million views. <br />
        <br />
        Keating says of the talent Nat Geo Creative represents, “These photographers have been here for a very long time and they are skilled in what they’re doing. They’ve cultivated an entire career very organically and are experts in certain areas.” This expertise goes beyond just shooting stills and videos about a subject matter and includes being able to speak and/or write about it so they can “demonstrate” their expertise. “It’s a way for them to build their brand around their expertise,” Keating adds.<br />
        <br />
        The agency has spread the word about the photographic, marketing and custom advertising services it offers in a number of different ways. They’ve done promotional and social media campaigns, but Keating says, “It’s also a lot about personal relationships so we’re pounding the pavement, and we’re reaching out, and we’re talking with people.” She adds, “We have very close relationships with art buyers and art director and creatives.”<br />
        <br />
        The recent trend in advertising toward branded print and motion experiences has benefitted Nat Geo Creative tremendously. “What’s happening in the advertising industry is that people don’t want to just buy an advertising page in the magazine or a three-minute TV spot,” Mulvihill explains. Instead, they want unique content that doesn’t scream “advertising.” Mulvihill adds, “I think photographers who have spent their lives building passions for what they do, like photojournalists, are uniquely positioned to take advantage of this trend in advertising.”<br />
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>Alvarez notes, “I think that Nat Geo Creative is in a good place because they have all this storytelling expertise they can bring to a project.” Plus, he says. “The income’s great, the storytelling is interesting … and what I do for the commercial clients I have is very much like what I do for the magazine. I bring a big storytelling set to a problem, but Nat Geo Creative sells all these things—photography, motion, talent—together under one roof.”

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        For today’s museums and other cultural institutions, luring viewers away from their screens and into exhibition spaces is more challenging than ever. Exhibitions that are interactive are “critical” to engaging modern audiences, according to Nick Appelbaum, a partner at the multinational exhibition design firm <a href="http://www.raany.com/" target="_blank">Ralph Appelbaum Associates</a> (RAA). “There’s an almost innate expectation, particularly amongst young people, that any environment will feature some sort of tactile, interactive experience.” Appelbaum says his firm’s clients are also considering how to speak to people outside of the museum walls.<br />
        <br />
        RAA has offices in five countries, and the company has completed more than 500 commissions over the course of 35 years for clients that range from the American Museum of Natural History and the William J. Clinton Presidential Library to the Smithsonian and London Transport Museum.<br />
        <br />
        Often in their work, RAA utilizes photography “as a complement to everything else that we can do, and usually as something that we can combine with other mediums to try and create something different and unique for the visitor in a physical space,” Appelbaum says.<br />
        <br />
        “There is increasingly a desire to mix media to create powerful experiences,” he adds. RAA has a media department that produces films, interactive experiences and photography, and RAA also commission new photographic work “quite often,” Appelbaum says. Even in cases where historical photography exists, “museums often want to feel current so there is a desire for new photography to be taken and to be included in exhibitions,” Appelbaum explains. “There’s a desire to connect the past and present.”<br />
        <br />
        For the Smithsonian’s Arctic Studies Center, a cultural center completed in 2010 at the Anchorage Museum in Alaska, RAA used high-resolution digital photography to give viewers an opportunity to interact with Alaskan Native artifacts in a way they wouldn’t be able to if they were simply examining the objects behind glass. Using a touchscreen, visitors, says Appelbaum, can “zoom in and look at the details [of the artifacts] and look at the texture in a way that they could otherwise never do.”<br />
        <br />
        For a project currently in the works, a library for former Russian President Boris Yeltsin, RAA will fill a large wall with an iconic photograph of Yeltsin atop a tank in front of the Russian White House in 1991, during a coup attempt. By combining the photograph with a scenographic installation that recreates what surrounded Yeltsin, RAA aims to “build a feeling of being there on the day,” Appelbaum says.<br />
        <br />
        One photography-related technological tool that audiences respond to, Appelbaum says, is “2.5-D,” an animation technique that makes two-dimensional photographs appear three-dimensional. The technique is particularly useful when working with historical photography. “We’re always experimenting with ways to take historical photography and to try to make it as alive as possible, and I think digital techniques help get us much further than we otherwise can go with zoom effects and just a simple display,” Appelbaum says.<br />
        <br />
        Despite the prominence of interactivity and digital technology in modern exhibitions, Appelbaum laments the number of exhibitions that use “technology for technology’s sake.” <br />
        <br />
        “You can throw a lot of money at technology, but before you do that, it’s probably worth asking yourself why, and it’s probably worth considering whether the learning goals of the museum are being met due to the application of interactivity or technology in the museum.”<br />
        <br />
        Increasingly clients are reaching outside their walls to engage audiences, looking to create exhibitions in public spaces or other trafficked areas. “The idea is that we can learn anywhere,” Appelbaum says. Parks, schools, hospitals and public spaces are examples. “If you take that attitude and apply it to the wider world you can see that the application of what happens in a museum, that social learning experience, is very powerful, and so we find ourselves working in increasingly new environments.” <br />
        <br />
        And it’s often museums and other institutions that are looking to step outside their own walls, be that into a public space or onto the Web, where sites that complement exhibitions have become the norm. Says Appelbaum, “They feel as though by having a bigger role in the communities in which they exist, or even an online presence, they can reach more visitors.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        Ask <a href="http://richardkocihernandez.com/" target="_blank">Richard Koci Hernandez</a> what recent innovations in photography impress him and he doesn’t hesitate. “<a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/" target="_blank">Google Glass</a>,” he says. “It’s the closest you get to the idea of the eye as a camera.” He predicts that “putting cameras and video within our point of view is only going to proliferate,” despite the fears of many critics, because of the creative possibilities and practical applications.<br />
        <br />
        At press time, Google Glass was not available to the masses, but Google made several thousand pairs of the Internet-connected glasses available for purchase (for $1,500) to winners of a contest earlier this year. Entrants were asked to describe how they would use Google Glass. Hernandez, an award-winning journalist-turned-professor, street photographer, blogger, and tireless explorer of new media trends and technology, was among the winners.<br />
        <br />
        Google Glass is eyewear that positions a tiny screen close to the eye, enabling users to search the Web, send and receive e-mail, navigate with GPS, and take photos and video using voice commands. “When I first got them, I thought the photo and video [functions] would be secondary” to the other functions, Hernandez says.<br />
        <br />
        He began wearing his Google Glass everywhere he went—on the street, to meetings, in cafes—and quickly found the Web surfing and e-mailing functions to be limited and disappointing. But the quality of the 5-megapixel camera “was way better than I thought it would be,” he says. <br />
        <br />
        Google Glass has drawn plenty of criticism over fears that users will be walking around in public, taking pictures surreptitiously of strangers for who-knows-what purposes. The potential for privacy invasion seems obvious and unnerving.<br />
        <br />
        Hernandez dismisses the fears as “knee-jerk” reactions that aren’t grounded in actual experience with the product. It’s impossible to take pictures surreptitiously with Google Glass, he argues. You have to give either a voice command to take a picture, or lift your hand to click the shutter. (Hernandez always does it manually.) Google Glass also lights up in camera mode, and it makes an audible sound when the shutter is triggered.<br />
        <br />
        “Google has made it so obvious you’re [photographing], that it’s hard to hide [it],” he says. “I can be more surreptitious with an iPhone than with Google Glass.” <br />
        <br />
        He continues, “Can it be creepy? Yeah. So I have my etiquette.” Walking into a room, he explains, he wears his Google Glass on his forehead “so when I engage them people can see.” <br />
        <br />
        And yet almost nobody has noticed him wearing his Google Glass—or at least, hasn’t let on—in all the months he’s worn them. Hernandez surmises people are conditioned by culture not to notice. “We don’t look [each other] in the eye. We don’t look people in the face. Sunglasses”—an accessory that’s as much for hiding our eyes as for shading them from bright light—“are a mainstay of our culture,” he says.<br />
        <br />
        It may be that people aren’t yet conditioned by uncomfortable experience to notice Google Glass. Whatever the reason, though, it is to the advantage of street photographers. “I’m taking pictures all the time—with no ill intent, just practicing the art of street photography—because people don’t look me in the eye,” Hernandez says. <br />
        <br />
        He sees practical applications beyond street photography, too. Google Glass makes shooting and sharing photographs easier. “They’re right there on my eye. I can see something, instantaneously shoot it and, more quickly than [with a] phone, share it to a network.”<br />
        <br />
        Google Glass is connected to <a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/" target="_blank">Google Hangouts</a>, where users can broadcast a live video feed. “I could imagine [a person using Google Glass at] a breaking news scene, or a photographer showing people what they’re shooting. For example, I have to teach students how to take evocative portraits. There are a lot of words out there about that, but few instances of photographers in the field, showing you how they work.<br />
        <br />
        “So I could put on Google Glass, hit record and show students from my perspective how I’m working. They could hear and see me interact with the subject,” he says. Although Hernandez has yet to broadcast while he’s teaching, he has posted instructional videos on a website for his classes at University of California, Berkeley, where he is assistant professor of new media.<br />
        <p></p>
        <p>“My next to-do is showing myself with a mobile phone, [using] Google Glass as a recording device to show what I look for” as a street photographer, he says. </p>
        Google Glass may or may not turn out to be the tool of creepy intrusion that many people fear, but Hernandez is far more excited about what he sees as a powerful and revolutionary innovation for photography.<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        In Eastern Kentucky, the once-thriving coal industry that provided secure jobs in the region is dying, and unemployment has risen to 18 percent. Government spending cuts on social programs has only added to the local hardship.<br />
        <br />
        Editors at MSNBC.com wanted to see how the changing economic circumstances are affecting the lives of average people, so they sent reporter Suzy Khimm and photographer <a href="http://www.petervanagtmael.net/" target="_blank">Peter van Agtmael</a> to find out. Van Agtmael’s contemplative take appeared on MSNBC’s website in mid-October in a 29-image photo essay called “<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/life-under-austerity" target="_blank">Life Under Austerity</a>.” <br />
        <br />
        MSNBC gave van Agtmael a six-day assignment that he describes as “pretty open.” He spent about half the time trying to photograph the people and places Khimm mentioned in her story. The rest of the time he wandered around in search of images that captured the feeling of the place.<br />
        <br />
        Van Agtmael has been photographing small towns across the U.S. as part of a personal project for the past two years. He never photographed in Eastern Kentucky, but says he was intrigued by the assignment because he had found the area “mysterious and beautiful” on the occasions that he has driven through it. He was also aware of the stereotypes of Appalachia perpetuated by some media, and says, “I wanted to see [the region] for myself.”<br />
        <br />
        MSNBC Director of Photography Amy Pereira was also sensitive to past media coverage in the region, which many locals view as shallow and exploitative. “I didn’t want [our story] to be a clich&eacute; of American poverty. I wanted it to have subtlety, nuance and a great deal of humanity,” she says. “Peter has a keen understanding of the subjects he works with. I felt he would give a nuanced impression of the place.”<br />
        <br />
        MSNBC, which has been struggling to shore up its audience, is experimenting with more in-depth coverage of big issues such as the environment, immigration and social justice. The company is re-launching its website, and Pereira says, “We’re approaching photography in the old-school way.” She explains, “You can’t go into a community, spend two days and expect anything with sophistication. It’s not fair to the subjects, and it’s not fair to the photographers.” <br />
        <br />
        Van Agtmael says he approached the story in his usual way: by wandering around to see “what soaks into my bloodstream, what I’m dreaming about and what seems important when I’m brushing my teeth.”<br />
        <br />
        The feeling he got about Harlan, Kentucky, “was this town being slowly, economically strangled because it essentially relied on one industry that is now dying. There are abandoned stores, for sale signs, dollar stores, signs for government assistance—signs of economic hardship, but not outright poverty.”<br />
        <br />
        Van Agtmael captured that feeling with a variety of images, including several quiet photographs shot at dusk of mostly empty streets with run-down storefronts for last-ditch businesses, such as a check-cashing establishment and a real estate broker advertising federally subsidized apartments. <br />
        <br />
        He photographed some of the people he encountered from a middle distance, rather than close up, partly because they were so wary of him. “Every attempt I made to get inside people’s homes fell flat,” he says. “They felt exploited by the mainstream media. It’s also a conservative area, and they were worried about a partisan take by MSNBC. They had no reason to trust me beyond my word. That only goes so far.”<br />
        <br />
        Shooting subjects from a distance, he showed them going about their daily lives in the context of the surroundings beyond their own houses. There’s a palpable sense of economic malaise over which individuals have little control.<br />
        <br />
        In one image, for instance, some residents of Harlan try to sell some household possessions out of the back of their 20-year-old sedan along a state highway. In another image, a man helps his son change into a football uniform in the parking lot behind a school, a scene that might play out anywhere. But here, the run-down school and its unkempt surroundings suggest a community that is barely hanging on. Van Agtmael says one of his favorite images is a picture of two boys—one asleep, the other looking painfully bored—in the bleachers of an old school gymnasium in Lynch, Kentucky. The caption explains they are waiting as their parents rehearse with a community theater for a play based on local stories that have been passed down through the generations. The image can be read as a metaphor for the region’s cultural dissolution and doubtful future.<br />
        <br />
        Van Agtmael’s subjects look like struggling working class people anywhere. He purposely avoided Appalachian stereotypes. They might have been easy to find by driving into the hollows (aka the hollers), he says, but the fortunes of people in the towns and cities are more closely tied to the coal industry. And van Agtmael adds, “I was sensitive to this notion of exploitation.”<br />
        <br />
        He says he passed up a chance to photograph a Pentecostal church service with snake handlers, and instead photographed a more traditional church service to convey a sense of the religious spirit. “I was far more interested personally and visually in the snake wrangling thing. I know that kind of image has become so representative of Appalachia, [but] it’s in fact a small part of [religious life] there. So I thought, what the hell, I’ll err on the side of going to the more conventional church.”<br />
        <br />
        Van Agtmael was unable to gain entry to any of the local mines because of federal safety regulations. So he ended up photographing exhibits at both the Kentucky Coal Mining Museum and the Portal 31 underground coal mine tour in Harlan County, Kentucky. The exhibits are idealized representations of the past that border on the surreal, and convey local pride. But in van Agtmael’s images, there’s a whiff of sadness in the bygone glory.<br />
        <br />
        The project drew criticism when it first appeared as just a photo gallery during the soft launch of MSNBC’s redesigned website in mid-October. (The story written by Khimm was posted two weeks later.) Roger May, a Raleigh, North Carolina-based photographer who photographs and writes about Appalachia, tweeted: “Just more of the same — @pvanagtmael’s disappointing &amp; uninteresting images of #Appalachia.”<br />
        <br />
        In a return tweet, Van Agtmael asked May to be more specific. They ended up talking on the phone, and afterwards May retracted his criticism of van Agtmael’s work. May later tells <em>PDN</em>, “I had a knee-jerk reaction … [the story] called up the ghosts of other fly-by, drop-in journalists” who have come to Appalachia to photograph “poor people living in trailers. <br />
        <br />
        “Peter didn’t do that. I reduced his work. I was frustrated by the fact that [the MSNBC photo gallery] didn’t include a single name of any person he photographed. It grated my nerves that a region and people that have been portrayed so poorly were given no identity, and no voice.”<br />
        <br />
        John Edwin Mason, a professor at the University of Virginia who writes a blog about photography, tweeted, “Editors, either give a photographer enough time to do the story right or hire an equally good photographer who already knows it. #Appalachia.”In a phone interview with <em>PDN</em>, Mason emphasizes the he was not accusing van Agtmael of “dealing in stereotypes.” But the story as Mason first saw it on MSNBC “didn’t give the depth and nuance that I think the story deserves.” He adds, “Editors should have commissioned any one of the half dozen photographers I can name off the top of my head who work in Appalachia and know it deeply and could have done a better job.”<br />
        <br />
        Van Agtmael tells <em>PDN</em>, “I’m not saying [my story] is a decisive representation. It’s mine, and I hope it’s honest and fair.” He adds,&nbsp; “Do you have to be from a region to photograph it effectively? The history of photography decisively proves that no, you do not.”<br />
        <br />
        Pereira, of MSNBC, says, “I feel like I did give [van Agtmael] a fair amount of time … I think he did [the story] in a way that will give insight to audiences [outside Kentucky]. And I would hope people in the community will look and feel that their story was told accurately.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        British art star Damien Hirst has sold some of his iconic spot paintings for more than a million dollars. But London-based <a target="_blank" href="http://www.seditionart.com/">Sedition</a> sells Hirst’s spot art for just $21. What collectors get for $21 is not a one-of-a-kind painting but a “digital limited edition,” a high-resolution digital file limited to 10,000 copies and capable of being displayed on any electronic screen from a smartphone to a flat-screen TV.<br />
        <br />
        The obvious question digital art that exists only on screens raises is whether file art is really fine art or just a likeness of art, a reproduction or a virtual representation of a physical object. But Sedition Director Rory Blain points out that people once asked the same question about photography. Is it art?<br />
        <br />
        “It’s a very logical extension of an art world tradition,” replies Rory Blain. “It’s the modern-day equivalent of the art world multiple, like photographs and prints.”<br />
        <br />
        Sedition was the brainchild of Rory Blain’s art dealer brother Harry Blain, formerly of Haunch of Venison, now a partner in the art gallery Blain|Southern. Harry Blain first toyed with the idea of marketing affordable screen-based copies of expensive fine art in the early 1990s, but it was not until 2011, when screen resolution and bandwidth had improved enough to enable the online delivery of high-quality digital imagery, that Blain teamed up with Robert L. Norton, then director of Saatchi Online, to launch Sedition.<br />
        <br />
        Initially, Sedition marketed digital representations of existing artworks, but most of the works for sale on its website now were created exclusively for Sedition.   <br />
        <br />
        Rory Blain says that while several online art portals use the Internet to market digital art, usually the output is in physical form, so Sedition has no direct competitors in the marketing of digital images that “turn screens into art.” <br />
        <br />
        Sedition collectors, who range from traditional fine-art collectors to art lovers who cannot afford the original art they flock to see in galleries and museums, are actually buying access to a computer code and the right to stream the encoded digital information on as many screens as they like. The hi-res digital images and videos are not downloaded directly but are stored in collector “vaults” on the Sedition server.<br />
        <br />
        Collectors receive a certificate of authenticity and the digital images are protected by digital watermarks on the Sedition website and by a security code attached to individual pixels, a technology the company is in the process of patenting.<br />
        <br />
        In just two years, Sedition has signed up some 60,000 members, who can buy access to the PNG and MP4 files s[edition] uses. The members can then display the images, but not print them. Prices range from a mere $8 for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wim-wenders.com/">Wim Wenders</a>’s “Lounge Painting 1,” a photograph of a hotel lobby in Gila Bend, Arizona, to $1,600 for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.elmgreen-dragset.com/index/1.html">Michael Elmgreen and Ingar Dragset</a>’s video of a day in the life of their “Prada Marfa” installation in Marfa, Texas, made from hundreds of still photographs of the faux Prada boutique in the high desert.<br />
        <br />
        “Generally our collectors gravitate more to moving images than still images,” says Rory Blain.<br />
        <br />
        The only edition that has sold out so far is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ryojiikeda.com/">Ryoji Ikeda</a>’s “A Single Number That Has 124,761,600 Digits,” a video in which numbers flash by in a blur. All 300 sold at $8. <a href="/Idris-Khan-on-Explor-8042.shtml">Idris Khan</a>’s “After Twombly … One Evening” is a stop-frame animation of photos made as he wrote a poem on a chalkboard and the series is sold in an edition of 1,000 for $29. The artists receive a 50 percent commission on each sale.<br />
        <br />
        As flat-screen televisions become more affordable, Sedition foresees collectors exhibiting their art on multiple screens displayed like sculpture and paintings in their homes. The company also issues public display licenses to enable museums and corporations to display Sedition artworks. Collectors can sell or trade digital works once an edition is sold out, though they must do so through the Sedition website.<br />
        <br />
        “It really is most helpful to just think of it as another form of art,” says Rory Blain. “Anything you can use art for, you can use this for.”

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        When photographers responded to our call for nominations for <em>PDN</em>’s All-Star Assistants, they sent in their stories of times when their assistants, digital techs or second shooters went the extra mile to make sure a shoot went smoothly—despite bad weather, a broken-down car, the first shooter too sick with the flu to handle all the shots of the bride and groom. They also described the qualities they believe are essential for every assistant to have—and what they look for when considering applicants who want assisting jobs. Though every photographer and studio has different needs, the same talents were mentioned again and again as being essential if an assistant is to succeed and grow on the job. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Getting Noticed</strong><br />
        When hiring assistants, where do photographers look for qualified applicants? Most photographers <em>PDN </em>spoke to say they ask other photographers. “I find them from word of mouth or recommendations by colleagues,” says photographer <a href="http://www.sheenacphoto.com/" target="_blank">Sheena Leazenby</a>.<br />
        <br />
        When building your network of referrals, it can be helpful to meet and talk to other assistants. Says <a href="http://matthewjordansmith.com/" target="_blank">Matthew Jordan Smith</a>, “I like having a personal recommendation from someone I trust. That recommendation usually comes from another assistant.”<br />
        <br />
        But it’s hard to get referrals when you have little experience, so how do photo assistants get started? Contacting photographers directly can pay off, especially if you can demonstrate that you are familiar with the work that the photographer does. <br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://www.donaldmiralle.com/" target="_blank">Donald Miralle</a> says one of his best assistants contacted him after seeing one of his photos in a textbook. <a href="http://www.markmahaney.com/" target="_blank">Mark Mahaney</a> says he’s hired photographers who e-mailed him. <a href="http://miketittel.com/" target="_blank">Mike Tittel</a> got a cover letter from a prospective assistant with a link to his personal website, and a note promising to follow up with phone call. “I was impressed by his professionalism,” Tittel recalls, “so we set up a coffee meeting and he has been working with my regularly since.”<br />
        <br />
        Some photographers, like <a href="http://www.horowitzphoto.com/" target="_blank">Ted Horowitz</a>, say they check the <a href="http://asmp.org/find-an-assistant#.UssRPfaZLmw" target="_blank">ASMP list of assistants</a>, especially when they’re looking for local help on a location shoot. <br />
        <br />
        Photo students who want to assist should use their school time wisely. <a href="http://www.fotojones.com/Artist.asp?ArtistID=39114&Akey=7GJQ8C4Q" target="_blank">Lou Jones</a>, for example, says he has found assistants through “photo school teacher recommendations.” He has also hired “standouts who start as interns.” <a href="http://www.monteisom.com/" target="_blank">Monte Isom</a> hired an assistant who “was one of my first and best interns.” <a href="http://emindeeimages.com/" target="_blank">Stephanie Hickerty</a> notes, “I did find my most recent [assistant] from an interview that was required for her class at the Institute of Art. I'm very happy that she chose me to interview!”<br />
        <br />
        <strong>The Qualities That Land the Job</strong><br />
        So what skills do photographers look for in assistants? That varies according to the needs of the photography business, which may demand different lighting or technical skills, either on location or in the studio. But being an assistant requires long hours and lots of work, so to land a job, you have to demonstrate that you have worked hard and been flexible when facing a challenge. <br />
        <br />
        “Work ethic” and “professionalism” were the two factors mentioned most by photographers describing what they look for when interviewing assistants. “Initiative: Everything else grows from there,” says <a href="http://anthonynex.com/" target="_blank">Anthony Nex</a>. “Dependability and timeliness go without saying,” according to Stephanie Hickerty.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Many photographers say that the qualities of character and personality are just as important as technical skills. “Photography can be taught to anybody but the ability to put your ego aside and get along with others is something you have or you don't,” says Matthew Jordan Smith. “Anyone can learn the technical material,” <a href="http://www.mccoolphoto.com/" target="_blank">Jackie McCool</a> says. “Not everyone can learn how to be diplomatic, discrete, kind, patient and never offended.” Stephanie Hickerty needs someone with an artistic eye and technical skills to serve as second photographer, but notes, “For the most part, camera skills can be taught … which is why they weren't at the top of my list. Being able to put the client at ease immediately and instill a sense of trust is key to making the day flow smoothly.”<br />
        <br />
        “A willingness to learn about all aspects of the business,” impresses TJ Houston. <a href="http://maederphotography.com/" target="_blank">Cheryl Maeder</a> says of her old assistant, “What is most important is that she is willing to learn every day and always wants to learn new skills.” &nbsp;<br />
        <strong><br />
        The Plane’s Delayed: Who Do You Want to Sit in the Airport With?</strong><br />
        When asked the biggest challenge his assistants have to face on the job, <a href="http://johnfultonphotography.com/#/portfolio%20+/New/1" target="_blank">John Fulton</a> says, to “sit in a car for eight hours straight with a stranger (me).” Shoots don’t just involve taking pictures, and photographers hire—and re-hire—the assistants who were still tolerable to be around at the end of a 20-hour day. <br />
        <br />
        Among the skills Richard Kelly says he needs in an assistant are, “mechanical skills, a sense of humor, an overwhelming sense of professionalism, great karma especially for parking, the ability to pack well, have long interesting conversations during waits at the airport, a drivers license, communication skills.”<br />
        <br />
        <strong>The Qualities That Lead to Success</strong><br />
        Photographers want assistants who will represent their business well. For some, that means assistants who have a personal stake in the photos. <br />
        <br />
        Monte Isom, “On every shoot if the assistants/techs are thinking about what they would do if it were their set, they can start to predict what the photographer needs. Also it prepares them on someone else's time and dime for when they are the photographer.”<br />
        <br />
        Says <a href="http://scottkelby.com/" target="_blank">Scott Kelby</a>, “I think you have to be a serious photographer to understand what another serious photographer needs, because being a successful assistant isn't about moving equipment. It's about being able to produce a shoot, spec and troubleshoot the equipment, coordinate with models and generally be a jack of all trades on the set.” &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Mark Mahaney says, “I'm constantly asking my assistants what their opinions are about images I make while I'm making them. I don't always listen to their advice, but it's invaluable for me to have their input or to keep their eye out for something I might be missing while I'm actively shooting and crunched for time.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        <em><a href="http://www.photoeye.com/bookstore/citation.cfm?catalog=KH094&i=&i2=" target="_blank">Intermarried</a> </em>is <a href="http://www.yaelbenzion.com/" target="_blank">Yael Ben-Zion</a>’s new photo book exploring the personal, cultural and political implications of “mixed” marriages. Published by Kehrer Verlag in Europe last fall and available in U.S. bookstores this spring, the book is a combination of photography, expository writing and excerpts of interviews with her subjects. <em>Intermarried</em> succeeds in large part because of the intimacy that Ben-Zion cultivates throughout the work. These couples’ homes, their children and their personal spaces provide a quietly powerful backdrop to their stories. This is domesticity politicized, and Ben-Zion’s careful hand steers around clich&eacute;s to challenge our assumptions and expectations.<br />
        <br />
        Four years in the making, <em>Intermarried</em> was inspired by an Israeli media campaign decrying the “loss” of Jews to intermarriage. As an Israeli-American woman who married a non-Jewish person, Ben-Zion was offended by the short-lived ad, and it triggered an impulse to seek insights into why people choose partners outside of their “immediate social group.” She started by posting on a message board for parents who live in Washington Heights, her New York City neighborhood, seeking couples who self-defined as “intermarried.” (This month Ben-Zion is exhibiting the work in the community in which it was made, at La Galeria at <a href="http://www.boricuacollege.edu/index.html" target="_blank">Boricua College</a> in Washington Heights.)<br />
        <br />
        From the beginning, Ben-Zion knew that she wanted to do more than just take pictures of intermarried couples. She wanted to know their stories—the whys and hows of their lives together. “I would go to these people and we would talk for a long time before I even took out my camera. I didn’t record [audio interviews], I told them that later on I would send them a questionnaire and they could fill out whatever they were comfortable with,” she says.<br />
        <br />
        Despite what she thought was encouraging initial progress, Ben-Zion began to feel that the images she was taking were lacking. More often than not the photograph was of a couple that “either did or did not have the same skin color” seated on a couch. Frustrated, she went back to some of her previous work, trying to ascertain what was missing. Her 2011 monograph titled <em>5683 MILES AWAY</em>, an allusion to the distance between her current home, New York City, and the city of Tel Aviv, looks at everyday life in Israel. Ben-Zion made that book with almost unlimited access to people she already knew very well, and that connection was evident. In order to make <em>Intermarried</em>, Ben-Zion realized, she would have to collaborate more closely with her subjects.<br />
        <br />
        “I like to work at the space between [candid and posed]. As I used a medium-format camera and lighting equipment, my subjects were aware of my presence. However, we spent enough time together and they were open enough to enable me to capture intimate moments,” Ben-Zion elaborates. “Moreover, even in the more constructed images—images that were conceived in collaboration between us based on an experience they went through—the images themselves were not strictly posed. Although my subjects were ‘acting’ for the camera, it was in reference to something they experienced or that was dear to them, and I think this comes through in the images.”<br />
        <br />
        These intimate settings and attendant conversations form the heart of Intermarried and force us to see its subjects as individuals and families, not “examples.” But the book’s essays, written by Yale University law professor Amy Chua and art critic Maurice Berger, address the broader issue of cross-cultural coupling, and bring an analytical edge to what is, on its face, a very personal work.<br />
        <br />
        Ben-Zion is actually a former student of Chua’s, and was struck by a memorable lecture in which Chua contended that the level of intermarriage was one indicator of social and economic mobility within a country. Given their relationship and Chua’s own experience with mixed marriage—she is Chinese-American and her husband is Jewish—she was a natural fit for the project. <br />
        <br />
        And while Ben-Zion didn’t know Berger personally, she knew and admired his work, which often deals with race and culture.&nbsp; She approached him with her concept and a slide show of images from the book, and Berger agreed to contribute his writing. <br />
        <br />
        With the essays serving as contextual bookends, Ben-Zion structured the book with a loose narrative arc in mind. The discussion moves from marriage to the couples’ children and their upbringings, to challenges the couples face and then on to solutions or “ways that people deal,” as Ben-Zion puts it. It ends with the author’s own essay, a poignant account of her friendship with a woman named Beatrice Rippy. They met in 2007 when Ben-Zion was a student at the International Center of Photography in New York City, and working on a project about elderly New Yorkers. By then widowed, Rippy had entered into an interracial marriage in the 1950s, when anti-miscegenation laws were commonplace in the United States. When Ben-Zion started working on Intermarried, Rippy agreed to participate. Sadly, she passed away only weeks later, before they were able to work together, but Ben-Zion dedicated the book to her and cites Rippy as “a great source of inspiration.”<br />
        <br />
        That closing essay is another example of Ben-Zion’s ability to take the controversial subject matter and imbue it with humanity and emotional resonance. Instead of a polemic, she gives us a nuanced reflection on interracial and interfaith relationships. <br />
        <br />
        “Most people have some kind of opinion or preconception about this issue and I wanted to try and have the viewer question their preconceptions,” she says. “I wanted to open a dialogue about these issues that are both very personal and very political.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        In early 2012, photographer <a target="_blank" href="http://dustincohen.com/">Dustin Cohen</a> posted a short video about a Brooklyn, New York-based violinmaker who is known for his exquisite craftsmanship and elite clientele. To Cohen’s surprise, the video went viral after Gizmodo, Gothamist, The Huffington Post and other sites picked it up.<br />
        <br />
        “I just kind of sat there and watched it spread around,” he says. “And Tricia”—that’s <a target="_blank" href="http://mergeleftreps.com/">Tricia Scott</a>, his rep—“said, ‘Don’t just sit there. You have to harness it and make the most of it.’”<br />
        <br />
        They started making lists of advertising clients who might be interested, and sending e-mails and personal notes. Cohen also rushed to post two follow-up videos—one about a watchmaker, another about a jeweler—and called his project “Made in Brooklyn.”<br />
        <br />
        The project has ended up shifting the balance of his assignments, from mostly editorial portraiture, to a mix of editorial and advertising work for a wide range of clients seeking both still and video productions for the Web and TV. He says the proportion of his income from advertising work is now 40 percent and rising. Budgets for the commercial jobs have ranged from $20,000 to $250,000, according to Scott.<br />
        <br />
        Whole Foods Market was one of the first ad clients to hire him. For one of their publications, they asked Cohen to photograph an urban farmer, a brewing supply shop and other subjects. Macy’s hired him for two projects, one for an internal campaign about diversity, and another about the company’s charity initiatives.<br />
        <br />
        He shot a 60-second spot about a multi-generation family with diabetes, to run during a program on Current TV sponsored by Roche pharmaceuticals.<br />
        <br />
        “That was as sweet as it gets,” Cohen says. “They told me, ‘We want you to do exactly as you do [the videos for] the “Made in Brooklyn” project, with the Roche logo at the end.’ I didn’t have to show any of their products.” <br />
        <br />
        At press time, Cohen was preparing to shoot a 90-second video for Bose about one its products. Bose had called Scott, and told her they wanted Cohen to shoot a video for them in the style of his most recent “Made in Brooklyn” video about a shoemaker. “There was no triple bid. They said, ‘We just want him, and if we can make the budget work, it’s yours,’” Scott says.<br />
        <br />
        Meanwhile, Cohen has another nearly finished branding video for Stella Artois beer, about an engineer who makes one-of-a-kind musical instruments. The documentary-style video, which will be ten to 15 minutes in length, features an instrument that the engineer designed to construct Stella Artois chalices.<br />
        <br />
        Scott says the “Made In Brooklyn” project appeals to clients because it resonates with the current popularity of products that are handmade by artisans. And Cohen’s stories “have a great human element” because he’s genuinely interested in why people do the things they do, Scott explains. “In advertising, it’s all about the story.”<br />
        <br />
        Cohen didn’t start the project to attract advertising work, though. His primary motivation, he says, was his love of documentary work, and his desire to stretch beyond portraiture by shooting more complete stories.<br />
        <br />
        “I pitched ideas to magazines,” he says. But they weren’t biting. “So I created this project for myself.”<br />
        <br />
        It began in late 2011, when <em>American Way</em> magazine hired him to photograph the Brooklyn violinmaker for a profile. “I showed up at his studio, and I was blown away by how amazing it looked. There were wood chips flying everywhere,” Cohen recounts.<br />
        <br />
        After he finished shooting the portraits, he asked American Way about shooting a video. “They let me run with it,” he says.<br />
        <br />
        Cohen went back with an assistant. He shot a video interview using two cameras, and then hung around the violinmaker’s studio to shoot B-roll. He called on an editor friend, Michael Hurley, to help edit the piece.<br />
        <br />
        Cohen posted the video on his own website, then started working on the videos about the watchmaker and the jeweler. Hurley helped with the shooting and editing for both videos, which Cohen completed within a few months of the first video.<br />
        <br />
        Cohen says he keeps “an epic notebook of potential stories.” He finds ideas by searching the Internet, reading local newspapers, and e-mailing and calling friends and acquaintances. “I go meet people, see their spaces and hear their stories,” he says. “It’s just legwork, really.”<br />
        <br />
        He came across his most recent subject, one of the last shoemakers in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn, through an article in the<em> New York Post</em>. Cohen ended up doing a story that was not so much about the craft of making and repairing shoes, but a character study “of a 91-year-old man you could just sit and listen to for hours,” he explains.<br />
        <br />
        He has since finished other videos, but hasn’t posted them. Cohen says he and Scott have stepped back to figure out how the “Made in Brooklyn” project should evolve. Scott says one impetus for re-thinking it is that a number of photographers are now doing similar projects. But more importantly, Scott says, “Dustin has to take his personal work to the next level to get to the next level of clients.”<br />
        <br />
        Cohen is pushing himself to the next level in two ways. First, with each new commercial assignment he gets, he’s boosting the production values of his work by adding elements: more experienced crew, more equipment and lighting, and better locations, for example. “It’s one thing to shoot a violinmaker by myself with the gear I have in my camera bag, and another thing to direct a documentary with a crew,” he says. “I want to do bigger and better projects.”<br />
        <br />
        The second way Cohen is pushing himself is by trying his hand at writing and directing fictional screenplays, with actors. “It’s the next level of directing,” Scott says. The stories “would be more concept-based, so they can translate into the commercial world.”<br />
        <br />
        But Cohen emphasizes it is still not the lure of commercial work that is driving his personal work. It is instead his desire to tell stories, and do it on his own terms. With the personal projects, he says, “You’re the boss. You set the parameters, and execute your own personal vision, and it doesn’t get any better than that.”<br />

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        Photographs can galvanize public opinion, and help change the course of history. Images helped win support for the struggle for civil rights in the US, turn the tide against the Vietnam War, and bring an end to apartheid in South Africa. There are many other examples of the power of images to affect change.
        <p>It is that potential to change the world--or even some small corner of it--that motivates many photojournalists to pursue their work, despite financial insecurity, and despite the hardship and danger in many cases.  But it is increasingly difficult to make a difference as a photojournalist. Images have proliferated, audiences have fragmented and also grown fatigued of images of disaster and suffering, and news magazines no longer provide the financial support and exposure for photojournalism that they once did. </p>
        <p>Photographers have responded by finding new, creative ways to approach stories, reach audiences, and bring attention to stories that can lead to positive change for the subjects. In many cases, the new approaches blur lines between journalism and advocacy. Photographers are also finding the interested partner organizations to help support their projects and to reach wider audiences. In some instances, photographers have been able to present their work to small audiences with a lot of influence, such as financiers with a hand in Africa's troubled mineral trade.</p>
        <p>The following stories describe a variety of examples and approaches by many different photographers, covering issues of public health, the environment, economic and social justice and other issues.</p>

            <article_text><![CDATA[
        Across the U.S., college and university communications departments are taking up video storytelling to reach new generations of social-media-savvy students, alumni and potential donors. Baylor University, the University of Georgia, the University of Notre Dame, and Brigham Young University (BYU) are among institutions producing some of the most ambitious video and multimedia projects used for student recruitment and fundraising.<br />
        <br />
        All four institutions won awards in this year’s Multi Media Competition sponsored by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.upaa.org/">University Photographers’ Association of America</a> (UPAA). BYU took top prize for “<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lb92N5TgQ4">BYU Mathletes Recalculated</a>,” a three-minute video that celebrates the university’s nationally ranked math team. The video is a montage of humorous behind-the-scenes footage from the set of a fictitious movie starring three math team members as the heroes. They’re stereotypical math geniuses: shy, nerdy and hopelessly inept as actors, to the exasperation of the fictitious director, a brash young woman played by a BYU student.<br />
        <br />
        The video succeeds on the strength of its preproduction planning and direction, overseen by <a target="_blank" href="http://photo.byu.edu/jaren-wilkey">Jaren Wilkey</a>, manager of BYU’s University Photography office. In early 2012, he produced the “<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AGT4M3Z1OM">BYU Mathletes Rap Music Video</a>,” in which math team members are depicted as star athletes, running into a sports arena to the wild cheers of fans. With 100,805 YouTube views, it was popular beyond the BYU community.<br />
        <br />
        Wilkey wanted to follow up that video with another after the math team’s successful 2012 season. “The hardest part was coming up with [another] idea,” Wilkey says. “People expected something over the top.”<br />
        <br />
        He spent more than a month kicking around ideas with <a target="_blank" href="http://photo.byu.edu/mark-philbrick">Mark A. Philbrick</a>, BYU’s University Photography Director, and several student photographers working part time for the department. Riffing on the theme of math team members as stars, Wilkey hit upon the idea of making a trailer to promote a fictitious movie about the team. <br />
        <br />
        It was a given that the production would require shooting behind-the-scenes (BTS) footage, which the BYU photo department now does on many productions because BTS videos are surprisingly popular, Wilkey explains.<br />
        <br />
        The more he talked with his team about the movie trailer idea, “the more we realized a behind-the-scenes video would be funny” because the idea of math geniuses as screen idols was absurd. Soon they were thinking of the BTS footage, rather than the fake movie trailer, as the main attraction.<br />
        <br />
        But humor is difficult to script for non-actors, so the challenge was figuring out how to make footage that was actually funny. They began by interviewing three math team members to get insight into their interests and personalities. They asked what the math competition was like, how the team members prepared for it and what interests they had besides math. “We wanted to do a segment on each team member that fit their personality. The pre-interview was key,” Wilkey says.<br />
        <br />
        They found one of the team members, Sam Dittmer, to be fiercely competitive. “When he talked about the math competition, it was like he was talking about the Final Four,” says Wilkey, referring to the NCAA college basketball championship. “We decided to take him to an outdoor basketball court, and do one of those Kobe Bryant videos about determination, but show him getting blocked and messing up.”<br />
        <br />
        Another member of the team, Hiram Golze, said he liked to think about math problems while riding his bike, so the storyboard called for biking scenarios out by the Great Salt Lake. “We were going for a sports-movie feel,” Wilkey says. <br />
        <p></p>
        <p>Wilkey and his team came up with situations that they thought might make the math team members a little uncomfortable. Their hope was that the team members’ natural reactions might be funny. Says Wilkey, “We have in the script: Here are ten things that would be funny if we could make them happen.” </p>
        The element of surprise was critical. Wilkey says that on set, all he told the math team members was: “This is going to be a weird experience for you. We’re not going to tell you everything that’s going to happen.”<br />
        <br />
        One scenario Wilkey came up with was inspired by his method for putting fake sweat on BYU athletes when he photographs them in the studio: he sprays their faces lightly with water. In the “BYU Mathletes Recalculated” video, the script called for putting fake sweat on team member Peter Baratta for a scene showing him taking a practice test. But instead of spraying him lightly, Alison Fidel—who plays the part of the director—sprays and sprays Baratta until water is pouring off his face.<br />
        <br />
        Fidel, who was a student assistant for the Communications Department when the video was made, is a trained actress. In her role as the frustrated director, she cued the various scenarios, then coached, coaxed and browbeat her hapless actors, while ad libbing most of her own performance.<br />
        <br />
        In Dittmer’s shoot on the basketball court, the script called for a trash-talking scenario. “All we had written down was ‘Trash talk’” Wilkey says. Fidel sat in a director’s chair on the foul line, haranguing Dittmer as he played one-on-one basketball with an extra—played by Wilkey himself. At one point she yells at Dittmer: “Make him mad! Insult his mother! Do something mean!”&nbsp; Out came Dittmer’s halting response:&nbsp; “Your mother … is not a good person! She has done cruel things in her life and that’s not OK.” Fidel casts a withering look at the camera and gives up on the trash-talking idea.<br />

        Wilkey describes it as a “small, run-and-gun, get-it-done” production. Shooting lasted about two hours with each of the three math team members. Videographer Brian Wilcox was the primary shooter, and he used a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/professional/products/professional_cameras/cinema_eos_cameras/eos_c300">Canon EOS C300</a>. A student assistant operated a boom mic plugged directly into the camera. Wilkey and a couple of student assistants shot B-roll video using a <a href="/Camera-Review-Canon-5887.shtml">Canon EOS 5D Mark III</a>. “On purpose I shot sloppy looking video” with the 5D to give it a rougher behind-the-scenes look, Wilkey explains.<br />
        <br />
        Lighting consisted of a mixture of natural light, a portable bank of fluorescent lights for inside shots and bounce cards for outdoor shots. “The lighting was pretty simple,” he says.<br />
        <br />
        The shooting yielded plenty of successful gags. The post-production challenge was to select the best clips and interweave them, keeping in mind that audiences have short attention spans for Web videos. “Two minutes is the sweet spot,” Wilkey says, citing his own experience studying the YouTube analytics of BYU videos he has posted in the past. <br />
        <br />
        Those analytics include information about where in a given video viewers begin to click away to something else. From that information, Wilkey has learned the importance of quick cuts and visual pay-offs for viewers that come frequently throughout the video. And he notes, “You have to hold good stuff for the end.” <br />
        <br />
        He gave Fidel the task of editing the video. “She’s just a great editor,” he says. “I told her, ‘Keep it fast, keep it upbeat, keep it fun.’ I didn’t want any lulls, I didn’t want to give people any reason to say this is boring and go someplace else.” <br />
        <br />
        The test of success is traffic, and “BYU Mathletes Recalculated” did reasonably well with 10,853 YouTube views. Although that number was far short of the total YouTube views of the “BYU Mathletes Rap Music” video, it was over the average of 1,500 or 2,000 views typically generated by the BYU Department of Communications videos. <br />
